looks<00:00:16.379> good<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.980> more<00:00:17.220> uniform<00:00:17.670> maybe<00:00:17.940> even

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
looks good it's more uniform maybe even

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
looks good it's more uniform maybe even
a<00:00:18.300> little<00:00:18.390> bit<00:00:18.539> more<00:00:18.869> mature<00:00:19.050> dare<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> say<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
a little bit more mature dare I say and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.529 
a little bit more mature dare I say and
it<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.400> maybe<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.939> little<00:00:21.119> bit<00:00:21.240> weird<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
it was maybe just a little bit weird to

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.349 
it was maybe just a little bit weird to
have<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.140> glossy<00:00:22.890> finish<00:00:22.920> panel<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.180> rest

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
have a glossy finish panel when the rest

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.759 
have a glossy finish panel when the rest
of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> thing<00:00:24.779> wasn't<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> goes

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
of the thing wasn't it just goes

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.290 
of the thing wasn't it just goes
together<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.369> itself<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.849> little<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.090> better

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
together with itself a little bit better

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.880 
together with itself a little bit better
I<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.869> next<00:00:28.080> change<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> little<00:00:28.769> bit

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I think the next change is a little bit

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.250 
I think the next change is a little bit
more<00:00:29.070> debated<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> Cu<00:00:30.090> H<00:00:30.240> 1200<00:00:30.929> model<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
more debated on the Cu H 1200 model of

the ps4 the eject button and the power

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
the ps4 the eject button and the power
button<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:33.840> both<00:00:34.079> mechanical<00:00:35.040> buttons

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
button are now both mechanical buttons

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.430 
button are now both mechanical buttons
as<00:00:35.610> opposed<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> touch<00:00:36.420> button<00:00:36.809> some<00:00:37.170> people

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
as opposed to touch button some people

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.720 
as opposed to touch button some people
think<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.739> good<00:00:38.070> some<00:00:38.309> people<00:00:38.340> think

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
think this is good some people think

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.880 
think this is good some people think
this<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.879> bad<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.480> reason<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.170> being<00:00:40.290> good

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
this is bad a reason for it being good

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.740 
this is bad a reason for it being good
sometimes<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> ps4<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.180> rubber<00:00:42.420> casing

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
sometimes when the ps4 is rubber casing

sometimes when the ps4 is rubber casing
expanded<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.280> things<00:00:44.460> do

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
expanded because that's what things do

disk eject which was obviously very

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.670 
disk eject which was obviously very
annoying<00:00:48.780> especially<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
fixed when you have mechanical buttons

however<00:00:53.280> there's<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.940> school<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> thought

that I don't know maybe not the riding
around<00:01:44.159> part<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.790> now<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.509> if

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
around part but now you know that if

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.969 
around part but now you know that if
you're<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> system<00:01:46.740> over<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
or something if for some wild reason you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.130

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you do it more likely you just walk to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.819 
you do it more likely you just walk to
the<00:01:53.850> car<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.540> backpack<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.560> 10%

seem as if any information explaining

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.660 
seem as if any information explaining
why<00:02:15.080> they<00:02:15.260> did<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.890> anywhere<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.580> it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
why they did this is anywhere but it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.950 
why they did this is anywhere but it
also<00:02:16.820> doesn't<00:02:17.240> really<00:02:17.360> affect<00:02:17.810> your

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
important thing to remember however is

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.840 
important thing to remember however is
that<00:03:48.170> functionally<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.860> PlayStation<00:03:49.400> 4<00:03:49.430> is

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
that functionally the PlayStation 4 is

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.150 
that functionally the PlayStation 4 is
exactly<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.750> same<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.350> likely<00:03:51.650> costs<00:03:52.100> a

exactly the same it likely costs a

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.100 
exactly the same it likely costs a

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
little bit less to produce and maybe at

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.660

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
some point that savings will get passed

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.420 
some point that savings will get passed
