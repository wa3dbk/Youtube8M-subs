00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 are not only the protagonists who are 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.569
 important if the main characters 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.610
 are very important as those mentioned in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.830
 last block enemies also occupy your 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.240
 place of importance this time we are going to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.559
 other top 5 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.500
 this time the scary characters 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.270
 of the games in my opinion of course if you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 have them add tell us 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
 comments and it's obvious that I will not be able to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:31.289
 put everyone here not said let's go 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:33.809
 there fifth have beyond eee 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.420
 slate what else does this monster do? 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.120
 scary does not look in itself despite 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.890
 be very strange but the suspense that the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 game does when you try to hide 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
 see those moments you saw in the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 runner and runs into him or 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 it simply arises from the trt mato esse 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.390
 now make it very tight so he 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 enters this list 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.640
 in four place we have the site tweets and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.430
 14 say that most frightens's games 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.859
 children series are all black pass from the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.470
 Human and creating the environment 14 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.479
 bizarre as you feel is invested 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 obligatory for those who enjoy the game that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 give you afraid of things that nor there just 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.630
 by the soundtrack and I'm a big fan 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 until the interest generated only two 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 newspaper by some may call pose 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.130
 plus the game and everyone now hashtag 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.460
 match against the ps 44 cents 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.159
 who the hell are you? 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.689
 site twice in the most do list 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.280
 What these guys have a certain 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.299
 need to create the bugs of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 moments 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.770
 What scares the person most responsible is that they do not 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.650
 matter how much you expand it back 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.780
 of chasing and gives much agony that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.509
 secondly we have a classic the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 content of many children at the time or months 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.600
 maybe the part that gets you the most 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.979
 apprehensive greens he goes slowly 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.220
 chasing that that would be the killer 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.070
 horror movie play we have a serious 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.899
 huge very strong completely crazy and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.700
 cris high walker 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.950
 but why is it so scary good 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.869
 Come on, you 're in the game, you can not. 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.909
 fight in this game you have dog 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.840
 hiding place to take care of crazy people and 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.060
 also the environment 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 cozy place all locked full of 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.640
 crazy people who rip your 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.959
 head 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.510
 I think this is enough to 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.310

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.010
