00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 the quick step multifunctional profiles offers the new fold 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.870
 solution for the perfect finish of various floor stickers 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.530
 with only ten profiles you can at most be over founder from zero to 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.070
 twelve to three millimeters 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.640
 the profiles consists of strength of stable minium in the colors silver gold and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.160
 bronze you can use as broadcast dust fell off as to passings profiles 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.499
 You may have to draw multifunctional profiles as a smooth transition between 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.109
 floor twice as high 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 for example in a doorway 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.560
 or in a large room where the floor must be able to expand 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.150
 Title profile also use as the adjustment suspensions to tidy height 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.040
 to bridge the differences between the two 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 for example, between laminate flooring and a life in the floor 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.570
 or early between laminate or living room and another lower floor 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.910
 the quick step multifunctional profiles is easy to install 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.330
 I use gloves because some parts of the profile can be sharp 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.660
 business dominium profile and the art or rail first at the right length 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.260
 Then win your profile consists of two parts you make each other for us along 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 the stream line 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.410
 hold the profile in both hands and begin to raise and lower on one side 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.580
 then break this step by step along the entire length of the profile to both 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.050
 parts are completely separate also the art or mail consists of two parts made of 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.600
 get rid of each other by cutting the notch with a front knife 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.240
 differences in height of up to 5 millimeters has you use the lowest world 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.250
 for height differences between getting away 85 months three millimeters 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.830
 became the largest 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.360
 you can use the multifunctional profiles as an expansion profile between 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.470
 sold the lay floor twice 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.470
 the fortress treo to the ground with screws 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.750
 You can also learn with quick step plan for dissatisfaction with the subsurface small 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.610
 it respects the drying time before you install the rest of the coffee 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.250
 but directly onto the surface between the two floors 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.120
 provide sufficient space between the rail and the two floors, take into account the 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.310
 recommended expansion joints political floor places you had the lower part 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.090
 then minimal profile also in the region the wing of the profile could handle it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.880
 the highest side of the world 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.620
 of course the profile from one side to the other in the world 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.169
 newspaper down to the floor 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.219
 make sure that everything is gray from dust and the minute particles 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.109
 place the upper part of it on those profiles vertically in the lower part 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.289
 and they return down mortgages early 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:32.219
 You can use the multifunctional profiles slot machine adjustment penalty fell 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.119
 notes in the same way 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:39.279
 In this case, make sure that you think the highest revolts in the world 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.059
 twente can take the wind from the highest floor 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.749
 you choose Eastern Wheat for the height differences between five choirs 5 and 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.999
 12 comac 10 millimeters and the lowest weel many height differences come to 5 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.559
 five millimeters 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.930
 we put all the benefits of the multifunctional profile on one again 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:55.619
 row 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.809
 who can use the profile for the different applications 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.590
 for quick step laminate and floor penetration 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.300
 also for the other floors with height differences up to twelve and three 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.279
 millimeter 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:11.259
 it is also a scratch resistant for a qualitative quick step finish of yours
