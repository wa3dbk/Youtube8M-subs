 how many for those who build the system 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 commercialization of innovation on themselves in 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 research institutes or 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.239
 at university we talk about such 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.730
 people who you build a system with
