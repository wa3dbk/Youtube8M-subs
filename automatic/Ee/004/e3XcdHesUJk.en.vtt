it's called in kindle and is simply a

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.320 
it's called in kindle and is simply a
fire<00:01:29.500> dot<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.980> will<00:01:30.130> stack<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.610> make<00:01:31.210> you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
fire dot that will stack and make you

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.500 
fire dot that will stack and make you
take<00:01:31.510> more<00:01:31.690> damage<00:01:31.900> from<00:01:32.260> it<00:01:32.440> for<00:01:32.890> more<00:01:33.070> stacks

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
take more damage from it for more stacks

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.940 
take more damage from it for more stacks
not<00:01:34.510> sure<00:01:34.720> what<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.020> threshold<00:01:35.470> for<00:01:35.710> swapping

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
not sure what the threshold for swapping

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.340 
not sure what the threshold for swapping
will<00:01:36.220> be<00:01:36.370> but<00:01:36.730> probably<00:01:37.510> three<00:01:37.840> or<00:01:37.870> four<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.320> a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
will be but probably three or four is a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.340 
will be but probably three or four is a
good<00:01:38.560> guess<00:01:38.820> he<00:01:39.820> also<00:01:40.000> throws<00:01:40.420> prototype

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
good guess he also throws prototype

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.260 
good guess he also throws prototype

of<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.970> pulse<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.930> will<00:01:47.050> be<00:01:47.140> sucked<00:01:47.409> into<00:01:47.620> the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
of the pulse you will be sucked into the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.160 
of the pulse you will be sucked into the
center<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.060> will<00:01:49.150> take<00:01:49.360> 26<00:01:49.900> k

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
center of it and you will take 26 k

center of it and you will take 26 k
nature<00:01:50.560> damage<00:01:50.890> per<00:01:51.070> second<00:01:51.460> until<00:01:51.880> you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
nature damage per second until you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.530 
nature damage per second until you
escape<00:01:52.300> from<00:01:52.480> it<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.950> simple<00:01:54.460> don't<00:01:55.150> stand

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
escape from it really simple don't stand

escape from it really simple don't stand
in<00:01:55.690> this<00:01:55.870> mechanic<00:01:56.580> but<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.700> does<00:01:57.850> force<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:58.330> a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
in this mechanic but it does force you a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.300 
in this mechanic but it does force you a
little<00:01:58.810> bit<00:01:58.930> too<00:01:59.140> spread<00:01:59.409> out<00:01:59.470> because<00:02:00.220> you

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
little bit too spread out because you

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.920 
little bit too spread out because you
don't<00:02:00.520> want<00:02:00.580> your<00:02:00.909> whole<00:02:01.150> raid<00:02:01.420> getting<00:02:01.750> hit

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930

so<00:05:07.030> abused<00:05:07.630> away<00:05:08.220> so<00:05:09.220> that's<00:05:09.610> all<00:05:09.759> for<00:05:09.970> the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
so abused away so that's all for the

so abused away so that's all for the

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
main mechanics of this fight mainly the

strategy<00:05:13.090> comes<00:05:13.300> down<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.810> dealing<00:05:14.289> with<00:05:14.319> each

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
strategy comes down to dealing with each

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.860 
strategy comes down to dealing with each
of<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.860> trains<00:05:15.130> as<00:05:15.340> they<00:05:15.520> come<00:05:15.870> you'll

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
of the trains as they come you'll

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.420 
of the trains as they come you'll
quickly<00:05:17.110> get<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.440> patterns<00:05:17.889> of<00:05:17.979> the<00:05:18.099> trains

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
quickly get the patterns of the trains

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.640 
quickly get the patterns of the trains
and<00:05:18.729> then<00:05:19.060> it's<00:05:19.210> just<00:05:19.360> sort<00:05:19.690> of<00:05:19.750> executing<00:05:20.530> on

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
and then it's just sort of executing on

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.249 
and then it's just sort of executing on
it<00:05:20.830> so<00:05:21.759> like<00:05:22.030> maybe<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.479> know<00:05:22.659> that<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.050> first

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
it so like maybe you know that the first

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.529 
it so like maybe you know that the first
train<00:05:23.530> comes<00:05:23.770> over<00:05:24.009> here<00:05:24.400> then<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.150> next<00:05:25.270> two

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
train comes over here then the next two

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.600 
train comes over here then the next two
are<00:05:25.690> going<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:25.990> be<00:05:26.110> way<00:05:26.319> over<00:05:26.620> here<00:05:26.919> so<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.430> can

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
are going to be way over here so you can

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.610 
are going to be way over here so you can
just<00:05:27.639> chill<00:05:27.849> here<00:05:28.090> until<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.139> fourth<00:05:29.409> one

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
just chill here until the fourth one

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.010 
just chill here until the fourth one
with<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:29.979> ads<00:05:30.130> comes<00:05:30.639> and<00:05:31.539> then<00:05:31.659> you<00:05:31.780> want<00:05:31.930> to

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
with the ads comes and then you want to

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.719 
with the ads comes and then you want to
get<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.289> gone<00:05:32.680> because<00:05:33.159> you<00:05:33.280> know<00:05:33.400> three

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
get it gone because you know three

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.860 
get it gone because you know three
trains<00:05:34.030> are<00:05:34.180> coming<00:05:34.479> at<00:05:34.599> once<00:05:34.780> next<00:05:35.320> etc<00:05:36.099> etc

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
trains are coming at once next etc etc

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.390 
trains are coming at once next etc etc
dealing<00:05:37.870> with<00:05:37.900> each<00:05:38.169> of<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.380> trains<00:05:38.710> content

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
dealing with each of the trains content

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.689 
dealing with each of the trains content
individually<00:05:40.060> is<00:05:40.270> all<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.020> strategy<00:05:41.469> is<00:05:41.699> when

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
individually is all the strategy is when

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.180 
individually is all the strategy is when
cannons<00:05:43.090> come<00:05:43.270> up<00:05:43.419> get<00:05:43.960> them<00:05:44.080> down<00:05:44.259> when

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
cannons come up get them down when

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.129 
cannons come up get them down when
trains<00:05:45.520> come<00:05:45.789> with<00:05:45.969> important<00:05:46.389> ads<00:05:46.570> like<00:05:46.960> the

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
trains come with important ads like the

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.159 
trains come with important ads like the
fire<00:05:47.349> mender<00:05:47.710> and<00:05:47.919> man-at-arms<00:05:49.020> lock<00:05:50.020> them

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169
