that<00:03:15.050> I<00:03:15.170> think<00:03:15.380> did<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.709> much<00:03:16.010> better<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.640> did

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
that I think did it much better and did

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.520 
that I think did it much better and did
a<00:03:16.820> lot<00:03:17.000> more<00:03:17.209> justice<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.720> these<00:03:17.959> characters

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
a lot more justice to these characters

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.530 
a lot more justice to these characters
really<00:03:19.190> they're<00:03:19.550> just<00:03:19.730> padding<00:03:20.060> out<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.330> time

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
really they're just padding out the time

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.449 
really they're just padding out the time
a<00:03:20.570> little<00:03:20.959> bit<00:03:21.170> more<00:03:21.230> something<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.130> get<00:03:22.250> their

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
a little bit more something to get their

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.090 
a little bit more something to get their
best<00:03:22.700> animators<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.540> work<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.350> big<00:03:24.650> badass
