interesting part test again and we move

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:31.359 
interesting part test again and we move
into<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.580> lounge<00:01:15.000> room<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.179> distance

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
into a lounge room this is the distance

this<00:01:42.720> isn't<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> true<00:01:43.289> reflection<00:01:43.440> of<00:01:43.770> the

this isn't a true reflection of the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.930 
this isn't a true reflection of the
speed<00:01:44.130> by<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.459> because<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.819> has

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
speed by the way because it has

00:01:44.940 --> 00:02:13.460 
speed by the way because it has
completely<00:01:45.390> stopped

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:24.600 

eventually<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.860> will<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.220> what<00:02:24.400> could<00:02:24.550> be

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
eventually you will see what could be

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:35.610 
eventually you will see what could be
here<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:25.060> night<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:32.100> anyway<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.780> think<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.470> get
