00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello this recording will be dedicated 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.670
 to the theme of mixtures you see that having 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.960
 we are in this painting workshop that does not 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 they look like paint and beige 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 It looks like a kitchen because it's a kitchen 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.379
 but I use it as a workshop 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 times and it is a place as good as another 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.539
 anybody when I work with the guys 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 of the art workshop cruz de mayo 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.369
 we have a workshop more like a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.830
 workshop we usually work with 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.320
 tempera school that are these for 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.910
 example that you see here but what I'm going 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 to say about the mixtures is worth 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 any other technique used by 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.450
 adults such as acrylic or 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 oil well let's start with the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.130
 basic blends the primary colors 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.560
 they are yellow 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.820
 the blue 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.180
 and the red 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.620
 these colors are primary because they are 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.630
 colors that can not be removed from 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.150
 no mixture is to say that you have to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.740
 buy them that yellow that blue and that 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.659
 red then the yellow formerly by 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.270
 example I do not read read though the yellow 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.800
 purest was cadmium yellow the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.259
 cadmium yellow what's up that I think 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.150
 now no longer manufactured because it was 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.940
 toxic normally in boats usually 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.979
 simply put yellow or yellow 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.600
 half the blue because you know that there 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.850
 lots of blues because for example 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.399
 we could also have this but it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.979
 considers that the primary blue is the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.320
 cyan blue that is more or less similar to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.690
 this one although it is not very abstract either 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.580
 because these are tempera colors and 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.369
 then the red on the red there is more 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.640
 whole life discussion has been said that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.160
 the primary red was this one red plus or 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 less like this there are people now who says 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.770
 that not the primary red is magenta 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.140
 that it would be a red like this 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.869
 well this is not very accurate either because 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.359
 as it is school tempera because this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.149
 magenta looks pink would have to be a 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.850
 little bit more intense personally 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.740
 I think the primary red is this but 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.619
 sometimes for certain mixtures we 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.360
 it's better to use magenta as 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.200
 let's see now then of the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.510
 primary colors let's take out the three 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.190
 secondary that are the most 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.799
 basic and already in other chapters 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.680
 we will continue with more complex things as 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.690
 let's start making the orange the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.480
 orange is made with yellow and with red 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.340
 as everyone knows we can 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.349
 happen when we do not know we are 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 beginners children for example is 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.340
 they do a lot of this put the color like this 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.990
 this is not a good idea because 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.100
 we do so 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.220
 we mix and see what happens to us that 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.990
 the color is practically red 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.180
 red is a very strong color and then 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.910
 yellow is combined what we have 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.790
 what to do is not to put one on top of the 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.790
 another one we have to put yellow 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.360
 and to the red side a little bit of red a 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.250
 little bit nothing and with the brush 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.250
 let's add 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.880
 this way I get a 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.320
 yellow I say a luminous orange that what 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.600
 I could have done more clarito and more 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.150
 bright if I had not already had the 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.140
 stained brush of red and let's 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.570
 adding little by little little by little until 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.250
 that we are getting the tone of 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.440
 orange we want beige we go now 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.040
 with the green I put here in this 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.420
 yellow and blue dish not any blue 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.700
 although of course you can do the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.530
 green with any blue but the one that I've 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.900
 said before the primary the blue cyan 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.180
 and I have made like with the orange a color 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.320
 side by side not on top of each other 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.630
 and then we add blue to 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.540
 yellow you see that this is a yellow 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.400
 very very clear you could say it's almost 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.330
 like lemon yellow it almost does not come to be 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.330
 to see does not become green we continue 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
 we follow 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.879
 we are adding as we go 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.379
 adding we are leaving one more green 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.379
 intense darker 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.710
 you see here it would be like a green 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.710
 grass and if we kept adding blue 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.330
 we could get to get a green 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.110
 bluish or a blue-green as 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.240
 you want to call there are many tones 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.600
 different from green that we will see in 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.840
 another chapter this would be the the green 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.310
 made simply with the two colors 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.680
 primary 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.920
 and now we go with the third color 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.150
 secondary that is the violet the violet 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.100
 it is made with red and with blue the violet 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.170
 It is the most complicated color to get 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.090
 and with school tempera very much more 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.790
 because the colors are not exact 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.910
 because we will get an irregular violet 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.300
 we do it as we do and we're going to 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.810
 do what 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.940
 how are you supposed to do it 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.860
 from a point of view of the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.860
 scholars we would throw yang 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.800
 and we would throw 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:49.390
 red magenta red magenta 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.640
 we mix 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.890
 we do the same thing we are adding little to 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.540
 little we can get a tone of 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.300
 more bluish violet 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.270
 or more reddish according to the amount that 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.150
 let's cast one or the other color 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.460
 that's how they usually say that they 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:13.620
 you have to make the violet mix 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:17.250
 with magenta and with cyan blue but we can 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.090
 get also a violet then using 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.249
 for example red 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:27.029
 and the red of all life 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:29.599
 and blue cyan let's see let's see how 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.599
 we would stay 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.490
 let's see how I clean the brush a bit 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.419
 we add 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.949
 you see this one would be 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:52.800
 more bluish and pulling red would be like that 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:58.249
 we also have a violet left a kind 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.249
 purple but more pulling brown 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.640
 naturally with tempera 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.160
 Professional colors would come out better 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.170
 and up to here the first chapter dedicated 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.050
 we have talked about the mixtures 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.300
 primary and secondary colors in the 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.820
 next chapter we will introduce the 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.720
 white you know that these recordings 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.290
 belong to the blog the mind in the hand 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.290
 until next time
