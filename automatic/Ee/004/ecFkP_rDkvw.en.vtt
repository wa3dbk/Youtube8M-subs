is<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> guess<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.250> hold<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.969> his<00:00:36.090> arms<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
is I guess you just hold up his arms and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.770 
is I guess you just hold up his arms and
then<00:00:37.170> he<00:00:37.260> does<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> slam<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.690> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
then he does like like a slam so if you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.440 
then he does like like a slam so if you
do<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> he<00:00:40.320> slams<00:00:40.620> his<00:00:40.739> arms<00:00:41.100> down<00:00:41.450> which

or giving he stuff like that I mean this

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
or giving he stuff like that I mean this
is<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> bad<00:00:53.340> feature<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.000> hides<00:00:54.360> within<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
is not a bad feature it hides within the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.110 
is not a bad feature it hides within the
figure<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.289> that's<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.590> pretty<00:00:55.800> cool<00:00:55.980> thing<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
figure so that's a pretty cool thing the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
figure so that's a pretty cool thing the
coloring<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.520> ok<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.090> could<00:01:00.629> have

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
coloring is ok I think it could have

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.540 
coloring is ok I think it could have
been<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.870> little<00:01:01.020> bit<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.100> brighter

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
been a little bit a little bit brighter

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.660 
been a little bit a little bit brighter
I<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.480> wrong<00:01:03.690> though<00:01:04.309> as<00:01:05.309> far<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I could be wrong though as far as the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.359 
I could be wrong though as far as the
Hulk<00:01:05.820> articulation<00:01:06.750> he<00:01:06.869> does<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.369> ball

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
not much detail as far as the figure I

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.859

everything so that's pretty cool and
it's<00:01:45.119> nice<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.329> he<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> closed<00:01:46.110> fist<00:01:46.409> on

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's nice that he has a closed fist on

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.160 
it's nice that he has a closed fist on
his<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:47.130> arm<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.820> his<00:01:47.909> left<00:01:48.090> arm<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.540> an

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
his right arm and on his left arm as an

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.889 
his right arm and on his left arm as an
open<00:01:49.530> hand<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.250> he<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.490> hold<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> stuff<00:01:51.030> he

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
open hand so he can hold on to stuff he

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.810 
open hand so he can hold on to stuff he
can<00:01:52.049> smash<00:01:52.409> low<00:01:52.770> key<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.280> left<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.729> right

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
can smash low key like left and right

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
can smash low key like left and right
and<00:01:54.030> left<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> guess<00:01:55.470> that's

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and left and right so I guess that's

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.780 
and left and right so I guess that's
pretty<00:01:55.740> cool<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.159> why<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.340> made<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> four

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
pretty cool that's why they made it four

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.889 
pretty cool that's why they made it four
so<00:01:57.450> overall<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.590> bad<00:01:58.740> figure<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.729> I<00:02:00.030> think

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
so overall not a bad figure but I think

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.730 
so overall not a bad figure but I think
it<00:02:01.049> could<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.320> been<00:02:01.439> better

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it could have been better

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
it could have been better
I<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> could<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.390> been<00:02:03.509> better

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I really think it could have been better

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
I really think it could have been better
they<00:02:04.619> could<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.860> added<00:02:04.950> articulation<00:02:05.610> on

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
they could have added articulation on

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
they could have added articulation on
the<00:02:05.850> wrists<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.770> know

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the wrists really I think that you know

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.889 
the wrists really I think that you know
makes<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> big<00:02:08.729> difference<00:02:09.090> especially<00:02:09.599> for

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
makes a big difference especially for

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.110 
makes a big difference especially for
the<00:02:09.989> Incredible<00:02:10.379> Hulk<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.120> ankle

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the Incredible Hulk and ankle

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.400 
the Incredible Hulk and ankle
articulation

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
articulation

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920 
articulation
but<00:02:13.710> overall<00:02:14.430> still<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> pretty<00:02:15.420> cool<00:02:15.690> figure

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
but overall still a pretty cool figure

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.950 
but overall still a pretty cool figure
and<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.950> think<00:02:17.160> as<00:02:17.400> far<00:02:17.460> as<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.660> size

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
and I think as far as that the size

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.580 
and I think as far as that the size
itself

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
itself

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.840 
itself
I<00:02:19.680> mean<00:02:19.860> he's<00:02:19.980> supposed<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> be<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.730> bit

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
I mean he's supposed to be a little bit

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.190 
I mean he's supposed to be a little bit
he's<00:02:21.090> supposed<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.330> be<00:02:21.420> bigger<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
he's supposed to be bigger than the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.440 
he's supposed to be bigger than the
other<00:02:22.350> Avengers<00:02:22.620> he's<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> little<00:02:24.060> bit<00:02:24.150> taller

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
other Avengers he's a little bit taller

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.530 
other Avengers he's a little bit taller
than<00:02:24.630> than<00:02:25.140> Ironman<00:02:26.060> when<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.150> look<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:27.450> you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
than than Ironman when you look when you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.540 
than than Ironman when you look when you
put<00:02:27.750> them<00:02:27.840> side-by-side<00:02:28.130> but<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.190> think<00:02:29.460> he

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
put them side-by-side but I think he

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.680 
put them side-by-side but I think he
they<00:02:29.670> could<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:29.940> they<00:02:30.390> could<00:02:30.420> have

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
they could have they could have

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.740 
they could have they could have
definitely<00:02:31.680> balked<00:02:32.490> him<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.730> more<00:02:33.000> made<00:02:33.630> him

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
definitely balked him up more made him

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.420 
definitely balked him up more made him
like<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> larger<00:02:34.290> figure<00:02:34.500> because<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.370> know

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
like a larger figure because I know

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.700 
like a larger figure because I know
they've<00:02:35.820> released<00:02:36.390> other<00:02:36.690> Incredible<00:02:37.680> Hulk

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
they've released other Incredible Hulk

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.860 
they've released other Incredible Hulk
or<00:02:38.010> Hulk<00:02:38.400> figures<00:02:38.970> from<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.510> Marvel<00:02:39.690> Universe

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
or Hulk figures from the Marvel Universe

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.630 
or Hulk figures from the Marvel Universe
and<00:02:40.380> they<00:02:40.530> could<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.770> increased<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.490> size

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and they could have increased the size

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.310 
and they could have increased the size
on<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.060> especially<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.840> when<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.080> see<00:02:43.230> in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
on this especially is when you see in

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.450 
on this especially is when you see in
the<00:02:43.350> movie<00:02:43.620> he's<00:02:43.740> obviously<00:02:43.890> much<00:02:44.280> bigger

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
the movie he's obviously much bigger

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.850 
the movie he's obviously much bigger
than<00:02:44.730> all<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.880> other<00:02:45.180> Avengers<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.560> know

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
than all the other Avengers so you know

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.470 
than all the other Avengers so you know
a<00:02:46.890> little<00:02:47.160> bit<00:02:47.310> more<00:02:47.490> size<00:02:47.790> increase<00:02:48.240> could

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
a little bit more size increase could

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240 
a little bit more size increase could
have<00:02:48.600> been<00:02:48.690> better<00:02:48.840> seeing<00:02:49.740> there's<00:02:49.980> not<00:02:50.070> much

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
have been better seeing there's not much

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.800 
have been better seeing there's not much
of<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.490> height<00:02:50.910> difference<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.480> they<00:02:51.630> should

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
of a height difference so they should

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.120 
of a height difference so they should
have<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.050> think<00:02:52.140> they<00:02:52.530> should<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.710> done<00:02:52.800> that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
have I think they should have done that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.220 
have I think they should have done that
but<00:02:53.850> still<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.300> know<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.780> pretty<00:02:55.020> cool

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
but still you know it's a pretty cool

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.890 
but still you know it's a pretty cool
figure<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.120> again<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.300> just<00:02:57.420> lacking<00:02:57.630> on

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
figure and again it's just lacking on

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.330 
figure and again it's just lacking on
the<00:02:57.930> wrist<00:02:58.200> articulation<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.980> ankle

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the wrist articulation and the ankle

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.650 
the wrist articulation and the ankle
articulation<00:02:59.430> especially<00:03:00.210> for<00:03:00.330> this<00:03:00.420> Hulk

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
articulation especially for this Hulk

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.510 
articulation especially for this Hulk
but<00:03:01.200> other<00:03:01.380> than<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:01.980> get<00:03:02.100> into

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
but other than that you can get into

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.670 
but other than that you can get into
pretty<00:03:02.760> cool<00:03:02.970> poses<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.900> get<00:03:04.080> him<00:03:04.170> into<00:03:04.290> his

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
pretty cool poses and get him into his

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.650 
pretty cool poses and get him into his
jumping<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.460> know<00:03:05.580> he's<00:03:05.760> jumping<00:03:06.540> from

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
jumping like you know he's jumping from

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.120 
jumping like you know he's jumping from
building<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.050> building<00:03:07.140> pose<00:03:08.090> like<00:03:09.980> or<00:03:10.980> you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
building to building pose like or you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.090 
building to building pose like or you
know<00:03:11.220> he's<00:03:11.520> fighting<00:03:11.910> he<00:03:12.090> can<00:03:12.240> easily<00:03:12.360> smash

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
know he's fighting he can easily smash

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.550 
know he's fighting he can easily smash
you<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.250> easily<00:03:14.370> punch<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:15.270> know<00:03:15.560> although

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
you can easily punch you know although

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960 
you can easily punch you know although
you<00:03:16.620> know<00:03:16.830> what<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.010> would<00:03:17.730> have<00:03:17.820> also

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you know what I would have also

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.340 
you know what I would have also
preferred<00:03:18.360> instead<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.870> doing<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.110> ab

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
preferred instead of just doing the ab

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.690 
preferred instead of just doing the ab
crunch<00:03:19.650> if<00:03:19.800> they<00:03:19.890> would<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:20.190> done<00:03:20.430> a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
crunch if they would have just done a

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.370 
crunch if they would have just done a
swivel<00:03:21.330> waist<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.900> actually<00:03:22.260> turn

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
swivel waist so you can actually turn

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.720 
swivel waist so you can actually turn
his<00:03:22.590> waist<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.280> while<00:03:23.459> he's<00:03:23.580> in

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
his waist and you know while he's in

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.730 
his waist and you know while he's in
action<00:03:24.090> he's<00:03:24.240> he's<00:03:24.660> jumping<00:03:25.200> or<00:03:25.350> something

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
action he's he's jumping or something

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.130 
action he's he's jumping or something
like<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.240> but<00:03:27.510> anyway<00:03:27.570> still<00:03:28.080> a

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
like that so you know but anyway still a

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.170 
like that so you know but anyway still a
pretty<00:03:28.500> cool<00:03:28.680> figure<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.610> know<00:03:29.700> not<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> bad

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
pretty cool figure you know not a bad

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.449 
pretty cool figure you know not a bad
not<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> bad<00:03:31.140> job<00:03:31.350> by<00:03:31.530> Hasbro<00:03:31.890> but<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.190> know<00:03:32.310> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
not a bad job by Hasbro but you know it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.880 
not a bad job by Hasbro but you know it
could<00:03:32.580> have<00:03:32.670> been<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> lot<00:03:33.060> better<00:03:33.390> but<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.200> this

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
could have been a lot better but I this

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.800 
could have been a lot better but I this
is<00:03:35.040> still<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> cool<00:03:35.490> figure<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.120> definitely<00:03:36.720> of

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
is still a cool figure and definitely of

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.870 
is still a cool figure and definitely of
course<00:03:37.220> still<00:03:38.220> worth<00:03:38.370> adding<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.760> your

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880
