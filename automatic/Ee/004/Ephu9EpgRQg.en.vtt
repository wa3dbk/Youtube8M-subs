00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
protein loaded up and what we're going

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.660 
protein loaded up and what we're going
to<00:00:45.670> do<00:00:45.879> is<00:00:46.210> work<00:00:46.989> through<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.379> series<00:00:47.649> of<00:00:48.100> scenes

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
to do is work through a series of scenes

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.490 
to do is work through a series of scenes
just<00:00:49.300> like<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.590> Hollywood<00:00:51.929> production<00:00:52.929> company

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
just like a Hollywood production company

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.979 
just like a Hollywood production company
might<00:00:53.739> you<00:00:54.039> have<00:00:54.070> one<00:00:55.059> scene<00:00:55.390> that<00:00:55.420> goes<00:00:55.809> to

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
might you have one scene that goes to

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.770 
might you have one scene that goes to
the<00:00:56.079> next<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.469> goes<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:56.920> next<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.480> the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
the next that goes to the next so the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.939 
the next that goes to the next so the
first<00:00:58.960> thing<00:00:59.109> we're<00:00:59.230> going<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.440> do<00:00:59.559> is<00:00:59.739> find

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
first thing we're going to do is find

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.520 
first thing we're going to do is find
our<00:01:00.190> initial<00:01:00.550> scene<00:01:00.789> which<00:01:01.300> looks<00:01:02.289> something

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
our initial scene which looks something

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.140 
our initial scene which looks something
like<00:01:02.679> this<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:04.440> now<00:01:05.440> we<00:01:05.520> save<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:06.820> scene

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
like this and now we save this scene

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.530 
like this and now we save this scene
with<00:01:07.480> the<00:01:07.630> tools<00:01:08.280> utilities<00:01:09.750> animation<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.150> I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
with the tools utilities animation so I

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.400 
with the tools utilities animation so I
had<00:01:13.900> this<00:01:14.080> animation<00:01:14.590> panel<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.510> I<00:01:16.510> save<00:01:16.900> I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
had this animation panel and I save I

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.530 
had this animation panel and I save I
set<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.250> scene<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.670> way<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.790> want<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.300> in<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
set the scene the way I want it in the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.430 
set the scene the way I want it in the
3d<00:01:19.930> view<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.000> animation<00:01:22.440> save

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
3d view and then in the animation save

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.680 
3d view and then in the animation save
the<00:01:23.770> scene<00:01:24.010> there<00:01:24.610> I<00:01:24.640> see<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> preview<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.570> the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
the scene there I see a preview of the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.790 
the scene there I see a preview of the
scene<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:28.360> I'm<00:01:28.780> going<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.260> come<00:01:29.440> back<00:01:29.650> to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
scene and now I'm going to come back to

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.030 
scene and now I'm going to come back to
the<00:01:29.890> 3d<00:01:30.130> view<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.810> alter<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.960> scene<00:01:32.200> let's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
the 3d view and alter the scene let's

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.690 
the 3d view and alter the scene let's
say<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.460> want<00:01:33.760> to<00:01:33.820> zoom<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.480> on<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
say that I want to zoom in on this

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.840 
say that I want to zoom in on this
particular<00:01:37.740> residue<00:01:38.740> right<00:01:39.010> here<00:01:39.340> or<00:01:39.460> this<00:01:39.580> a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
particular residue right here or this a

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.690 
particular residue right here or this a
sexual<00:01:40.480> substrate<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:42.070> we'll<00:01:42.340> make<00:01:42.490> this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
sexual substrate and we'll make this

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.580 
sexual substrate and we'll make this
scene<00:01:43.180> number<00:01:43.540> two<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:43.990> come<00:01:44.200> back<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
scene number two so come back to the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.710 
scene number two so come back to the
animation<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:47.530> save<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.190> scene<00:01:48.720> now

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
animation and now save that scene now

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.070 
animation and now save that scene now
let's<00:01:50.500> do<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.950> more<00:01:51.040> complicated<00:01:51.550> scene<00:01:52.090> for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
let's do a more complicated scene for

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.940 
let's do a more complicated scene for
example<00:01:53.170> what<00:01:54.010> if<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.540> now<00:01:56.130> color<00:01:57.540> by<00:02:00.840> rainbow

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
example what if we now color by rainbow

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.830 
example what if we now color by rainbow
so<00:02:02.950> now<00:02:03.160> I'm<00:02:03.520> going<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.880> apply<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.120> rainbow<00:02:04.660> and

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
so now I'm going to apply a rainbow and

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.839 
so now I'm going to apply a rainbow and
we<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.170> see<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:06.270> color<00:02:07.270> from<00:02:07.630> blue<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.590> red<00:02:08.849> so

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
we can see the color from blue to red so

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.920 
we can see the color from blue to red so
let's<00:02:10.239> set<00:02:10.989> another<00:02:11.410> scene<00:02:12.390> okay<00:02:13.390> how's<00:02:13.900> that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
let's set another scene okay how's that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.369 
let's set another scene okay how's that
for<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.470> scene<00:02:14.769> maybe<00:02:15.040> something<00:02:15.550> like<00:02:15.730> that

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
for a scene maybe something like that

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.950 
for a scene maybe something like that
and<00:02:17.379> I'll<00:02:17.650> save<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.010> scene<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.960> then

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
and I'll save that scene and then

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.680 
and I'll save that scene and then
finally<00:02:20.440> let's<00:02:20.830> say<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.490> want<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> see<00:02:22.660> a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
finally let's say that I want to see a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.250 
finally let's say that I want to see a
surface

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
surface

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.009 
surface
so<00:02:24.560> I'll<00:02:24.860> create<00:02:25.159> a<00:02:25.250> surface<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.840> go

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
so I'll create a surface and there we go

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.259 
so I'll create a surface and there we go
now<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.440> surface<00:02:33.920> we're<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> color

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
now this surface we're going to color

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.979 
now this surface we're going to color
this<00:02:35.540> surface<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:39.310> different<00:02:40.310> color<00:02:40.989> let's

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
this surface a different color let's

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.940 
this surface a different color let's
color<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.560> surface<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.549> be<00:02:46.239> just<00:02:47.239> cyan<00:02:47.950> there

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
color the surface to be just cyan there

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
color the surface to be just cyan there
it<00:02:49.099> is<00:02:49.239> our<00:02:50.239> surface<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:52.160> fact<00:02:52.400> actually<00:02:52.760> let's

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
it is our surface in fact actually let's

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.520 
it is our surface in fact actually let's
color<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.360> surface<00:02:53.810> instead<00:02:54.200> by

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
color the surface instead by

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.369 
color the surface instead by
hydrophobicity<00:02:55.629> so<00:03:01.540> render<00:03:02.540> by<00:03:02.750> attribute

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
hydrophobicity so render by attribute

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:14.759 
hydrophobicity so render by attribute
and<00:03:08.379> we'll<00:03:09.379> color<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.920> surface<00:03:11.319> by<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
and we'll color the surface by the

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.949 
and we'll color the surface by the
residue<00:03:15.879> hydrophobicity<00:03:16.879> there<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:18.049> go

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
residue hydrophobicity there we go

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.160 
residue hydrophobicity there we go
only<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.109> surface<00:03:24.430> here<00:03:25.430> we<00:03:25.549> go

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
only the surface here we go

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.770 
only the surface here we go
so<00:03:27.170> hydrophobic<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.190> red<00:03:28.489> hydrophilic<00:03:29.480> is

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
so hydrophobic is red hydrophilic is

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.159 
so hydrophobic is red hydrophilic is
blue<00:03:30.970> there's<00:03:31.970> our<00:03:32.209> surface<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.019> now

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
blue there's our surface and now

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:38.020 
blue there's our surface and now
actually<00:03:34.930> from<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.139> surface<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.859> want<00:03:37.790> to

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
actually from the surface I want to

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.390 
actually from the surface I want to
slice<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.650> again<00:03:40.209> we'll<00:03:42.160> per<00:03:43.160> model

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
slice it so again we'll per model

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.809 
slice it so again we'll per model
clipping<00:03:44.680> clip<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.889> surface<00:03:46.959> there<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.169> is

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
clipping clip the surface there it is

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.890 
clipping clip the surface there it is
here's<00:03:49.819> our<00:03:50.090> surface<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.930> clip<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:52.540> zoom<00:03:53.540> in

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
here's our surface to clip and zoom in

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.900 
here's our surface to clip and zoom in
on<00:03:54.579> another<00:03:55.579> scene<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.440> there's<00:03:58.280> our<00:03:58.609> new

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
on another scene so there's our new

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.819 
on another scene so there's our new
surface<00:03:59.389> and<00:03:59.859> I'll<00:04:00.859> save<00:04:01.160> that<00:04:01.459> scene<00:04:02.829> back

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
surface and I'll save that scene back

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.159 
surface and I'll save that scene back
here<00:04:04.099> in<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.280> animation<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:06.519> then<00:04:07.519> finally

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
here in the animation and then finally

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.539 
here in the animation and then finally
zoom<00:04:09.169> out<00:04:09.319> again<00:04:10.480> we'll<00:04:11.480> turn<00:04:11.930> off<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.549> per

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
zoom out again we'll turn off the per

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:21.069 
zoom out again we'll turn off the per
model<00:04:13.879> clipping<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.840> instead<00:04:19.269> make<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
model clipping and instead make the

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.409 
model clipping and instead make the
surface<00:04:22.000> transparent<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.940> will<00:04:26.120> be<00:04:26.240> our

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
surface transparent this will be our

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.050 
surface transparent this will be our
final<00:04:26.840> scene<00:04:27.220> note<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.729> probably

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
final scene note that this is probably

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.240 
final scene note that this is probably
not<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.419> most<00:04:29.570> attractive<00:04:29.840> scene<00:04:30.620> but<00:04:30.919> it's<00:04:31.160> a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
not the most attractive scene but it's a

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.649 
not the most attractive scene but it's a
demonstration<00:04:31.520> of<00:04:32.060> what's<00:04:32.240> possible<00:04:32.300> and

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
demonstration of what's possible and

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.620 
demonstration of what's possible and
finally

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
finally

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:46.430 
finally
save<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.930> scene<00:04:39.320> now<00:04:39.590> as<00:04:39.800> well

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.500
