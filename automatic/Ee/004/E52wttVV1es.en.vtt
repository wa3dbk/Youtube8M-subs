so<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.480> is<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.989> ER<00:00:01.020> v<00:00:01.380> it's<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.370> world's

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so this is the ER v it's the world's

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.360 
so this is the ER v it's the world's
most<00:00:02.790> compact<00:00:03.300> personal<00:00:03.929> EV<00:00:04.290> achill<00:00:04.650> it's

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
most compact personal EV achill it's

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.249 
most compact personal EV achill it's
designed<00:00:05.850> for<00:00:05.970> urban<00:00:06.540> commuters<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.170> are

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
designed for urban commuters that are

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.410 
designed for urban commuters that are
taking<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.710> train<00:00:07.950> or<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.250> bus<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:09.000> get<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> work

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.720 
taking a train or a bus to get to work
and<00:00:09.690> then<00:00:09.780> they<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> vehicle<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.769> get<00:00:11.550> to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
and then they have a vehicle to get to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.089 
and then they have a vehicle to get to
their<00:00:11.849> last<00:00:12.059> destination<00:00:12.889> essentially<00:00:13.889> it's

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
their last destination essentially it's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.840 
their last destination essentially it's
a<00:00:14.509> lithium-ion<00:00:15.509> battery<00:00:16.020> pack<00:00:16.139> here<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.980> has<00:00:17.820> a

20 mile range top speed of 15 miles per
hour<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.650> you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.830> fold<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> up<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:24.470> this<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
hour and you can fold it up like this to

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.089 
hour and you can fold it up like this to
take<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.720> weighs<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:28.680> less<00:00:28.830> than

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
take with you weighs a little less than

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.069 
take with you weighs a little less than
30<00:00:29.340> pounds<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.289> two<00:00:31.500> models<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.099> have

30 pounds or we have two models we have
at<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> two<00:00:34.350> wheeler<00:00:34.739> jupi<00:00:35.309> model<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.940> we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
at the two wheeler jupi model and we

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.290 
at the two wheeler jupi model and we
have<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> three<00:00:36.570> wheeler<00:00:36.989> trike<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
have the three wheeler trike so that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.580 
have the three wheeler trike so that
they<00:00:39.540> serve<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> couple<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> different

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
they serve a couple of different

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
they serve a couple of different
purposes<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.219> one's<00:00:41.460> good<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.730> slow<00:00:42.120> speed

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
purposes this one's good for slow speed

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.020 
purposes this one's good for slow speed
easy<00:00:43.200> maneuverability<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.700> one's<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> little

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
easy maneuverability this one's a little

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.270 
easy maneuverability this one's a little
bit<00:00:45.270> better<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.629> higher<00:00:45.809> speeds<00:00:46.160> how<00:00:47.160> does

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
bit better for higher speeds how does

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.529 
bit better for higher speeds how does
that<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.520> fold<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> agreement

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that one fold right there the agreement

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.580 
that one fold right there the agreement
same<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:48.930> same<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:51.020> just<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.379> this

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
same way same way just like that this

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.930 
same way same way just like that this
one<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.219> wheel<00:00:53.399> along<00:00:53.699> with

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
one you can kind of wheel along with

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
one you can kind of wheel along with
your<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> piece<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> luggage<00:00:55.460> how<00:00:56.460> much<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
your like a piece of luggage how much is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
your like a piece of luggage how much is
that<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.090> same<00:00:57.899> how<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> same<00:00:58.620> but

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that one way same how about the same but

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.720 
that one way same how about the same but
the<00:00:58.980> same<00:00:59.129> time

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.469 

now<00:01:02.630> how<00:01:02.750> long<00:01:02.930> does<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.320> battery<00:01:03.350> last<00:01:04.479> so

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
now how long does the battery last so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.200 
now how long does the battery last so
the<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.900> range<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.800> is<00:01:06.950> about<00:01:07.159> 20<00:01:07.550> miles<00:01:07.729> as

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
the the range of it is about 20 miles as

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.960 
the the range of it is about 20 miles as
I<00:01:08.300> said<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:08.930> it<00:01:09.740> takes<00:01:09.920> about<00:01:10.040> four<00:01:10.400> hours<00:01:10.430> to

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
I said so it takes about four hours to

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.469 
I said so it takes about four hours to
charge<00:01:11.500> regular<00:01:12.500> 110<00:01:13.130> wall<00:01:13.490> outlet<00:01:14.030> just<00:01:14.300> plug

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
charge regular 110 wall outlet just plug

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.700 
charge regular 110 wall outlet just plug
it<00:01:14.659> in<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.430> also<00:01:16.580> take<00:01:16.909> 220<00:01:17.479> for<00:01:17.840> European

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
it in and it also take 220 for European

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.240 
it in and it also take 220 for European
countries<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:20.050> yeah<00:01:21.050> I<00:01:21.080> mean<00:01:21.380> it'll<00:01:21.800> last<00:01:22.040> you

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
countries and yeah I mean it'll last you

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.930 
countries and yeah I mean it'll last you
all<00:01:22.280> day<00:01:22.460> long<00:01:24.160> now<00:01:25.160> what<00:01:25.340> kind<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.520> tires<00:01:25.759> are

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
all day long now what kind of tires are

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.510 
all day long now what kind of tires are
those<00:01:26.090> this<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.509> inflated<00:01:27.140> tires<00:01:27.470> or<00:01:27.800> pneumatic

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
those this I inflated tires or pneumatic

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.840 
those this I inflated tires or pneumatic
inflated<00:01:29.030> air<00:01:29.180> there<00:01:29.540> are<00:01:29.630> two<00:01:29.780> tires<00:01:30.430> like<00:01:31.430> so

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
inflated air there are two tires like so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.810 
inflated air there are two tires like so
let's<00:01:32.090> say<00:01:32.300> one<00:01:32.540> pops<00:01:33.100> can<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.190> be<00:01:34.340> easily

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
let's say one pops can I be easily

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.760 
let's say one pops can I be easily
replaced<00:01:35.060> by<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:35.960> replaced<00:01:36.140> through<00:01:36.619> us

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
replaced by and be replaced through us

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.609 
replaced by and be replaced through us
we<00:01:37.100> have<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.460> source<00:01:37.700> for<00:01:38.000> them<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.500> we<00:01:39.500> are

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
we have a source for them and we are

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.859 
we have a source for them and we are
looking<00:01:40.009> at<00:01:40.160> another<00:01:40.460> tire<00:01:40.940> technology<00:01:41.300> it's

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
looking at another tire technology it's

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.370 
looking at another tire technology it's
really<00:01:42.140> cool<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:42.560> actually<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:44.380> tubeless

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
really cool it's actually a tubeless

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.040 
really cool it's actually a tubeless
tire<00:01:46.369> that's<00:01:46.789> not<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.479> played<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:47.869> but

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
tire that's not here and played it but

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.200 
tire that's not here and played it but
it<00:01:48.200> has<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> structural<00:01:49.130> component<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:49.850> so

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
it has a structural component to it so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.389 
it has a structural component to it so
it<00:01:50.750> will<00:01:50.899> never<00:01:51.050> prompt<00:01:51.410> Oh<00:01:51.619> kind<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.070> like<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
it will never prompt Oh kind of like the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.370 
it will never prompt Oh kind of like the
I<00:01:52.670> know<00:01:52.850> time<00:01:53.090> out<00:01:53.270> there<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> military

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
I know time out there like the military

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.100 
I know time out there like the military
like<00:01:54.860> ATVs<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:56.179> so<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.539> they've<00:01:56.780> got<00:01:56.960> this

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
like ATVs is so that they've got this

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.300 
like ATVs is so that they've got this
new<00:01:57.289> technology<00:01:59.500> that<00:02:00.500> looks<00:02:01.160> like<00:02:01.250> a

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
new technology that looks like a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.300 
new technology that looks like a
honeycomb<00:02:01.610> inside<00:02:02.090> right<00:02:02.500> yeah<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:04.130> won't

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
two wheelers there's a little bit better

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:50.129
