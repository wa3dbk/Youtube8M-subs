00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.779
 hello how are we with our themes 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.610
 informative about pathologies and topics of 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.850
 fitness training 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.490
 Now let's talk 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.420
 of a problem of a pathology that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.090
 affects many older women 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.380
 osteoporosis is menopausal 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.280
 osteoporosis is called the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.199
 crystal bone disease 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.840
 however you have to take into account 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:48.430
 that before reaching this situation 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.649
 serious in which a minimal gesture can 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.280
 cause a fracture a person have 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.170
 It passed many stages and not everyone 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.690
 have to be careful 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.390
 'between cottons' we can do 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.790
 certain work patterns with a 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.890
 person who is losing bone density 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.960
 no need to enter in any kind 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.899
 of risk there is one thing that if you really 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.630
 is important and is that someone who has 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.509
 Fragile bones very fragile or little 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.810
 fragile but really in a situation of 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.420
 risk we can not allow it to fall and 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.970
 that's why one of our 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.720
 main jobs is to be by your side 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.569
 and be always supporting you in a 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.970
 Firm position firm in such a way 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:37.750
 that when this person is balanced 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.509
 we can take it and help her not 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.049
 fall and not fall we also the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.689
 physical exercise helps the treatment of 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.620
 osteoporosis and in addition in a way 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:55.380
 very paradoxical 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:59.200
 accumulation of calcium in the bone mesh 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.050
 depends on whether there is an impact depends 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.090
 that there is a pressure that stimulates that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.570
 increase 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.030
 I will give you an inverse example 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.030
 when astronauts are in space 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.420
 they spend a long time they are in 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.420
 weightlessness 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.359
 Astronauts spend a lot 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.640
 of your time doing exercise doing 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.790
 isometric exercises 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.010
 the swimmers who also spend a lot 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.830
 time in the water that is a means of 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.190
 less serious they should do great 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 weight training sessions to ensure that 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.489
 your bones are not decalcified 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.299
 taking these two as an example 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.689
 groups that are high athletes 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.879
 level people very physically prepared 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:52.069
 you will see how we can work with 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:57.739
 our customers osteoporosis 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:01.730
 responds very well to load stimuli to 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.720
 stimuli that are very short impacts 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.000
 travel that must be impacts 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.269
 remarkable but of the short journey in 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.329
 This sense is very useful for 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.780
 vibrating platforms platforms 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:22.159
 vibratory can adjust the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.230
 frequency and height of impacts and 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.750
 therefore the entire exercise program 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.639
 what can we do through these 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 machines by means of these elements 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.730
 It will be of great benefit to people 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.230
 who work with us 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.190
 now we have a huge arsenal of 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.780
 guided machines tools weights 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.370
 elastic bands manual resistance 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:53.170
 through which we can generate 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:56.739
 Tensions in muscle insertion 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.010
 with bone and then there thanks to that 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.450
 tension thanks to that traction the bone 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.630
 it becomes or is stimulated to be 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.440
 requalified 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.770
 we will never achieve the same level of 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.620
 calcium than when we were 40 years old but 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.860
 obviously we will achieve that the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.770
 people who suffer from osteoporosis and who 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.950
 In addition, this osteoporosis can be 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.650
 painful have better quality of life not 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.220
 have pain and have more bones 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.370
 resistant 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.370
 see you in the next and until then
