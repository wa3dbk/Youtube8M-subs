00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.740 

okay<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> end<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> first<00:01:13.170> line<00:01:13.440> I

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
okay that's the end of the first line I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.880 
okay that's the end of the first line I
didn't<00:01:15.750> tell<00:01:15.870> you<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.110> fingers<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.620> put<00:01:16.740> down

but if you listen and watch I think you

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.200

it down into oh yeah and then you went
back<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> but<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.540> was<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.780> prime<00:04:29.170> because<00:04:29.680> it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
back to a but it was a prime because it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.320 
back to a but it was a prime because it
had<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.040> different<00:04:30.280> ending<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.000> then<00:04:31.240> you

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
had that different ending and then you

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.910 
had that different ending and then you
did<00:04:31.480> V<00:04:31.630> again<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.080> then<00:04:32.170> went<00:04:32.410> back<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.650> did<00:04:32.740> a

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
did V again and then went back and did a

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.500 
did V again and then went back and did a
prime<00:04:33.250> with<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.520> different<00:04:33.790> ending<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.270> this

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
prime with the different ending so this

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.800 
prime with the different ending so this
is<00:04:34.630> really<00:04:34.780> kind<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.640> two<00:04:36.640> lines<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.510> second

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
is really kind of two lines the second

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.990 
is really kind of two lines the second
of<00:04:37.870> which<00:04:38.020> has<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.460> variation<00:04:39.460> in<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.760> ending

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
of which has a variation in the ending

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.740 
of which has a variation in the ending
so<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:41.620> get<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.980> great<00:04:42.280> piece<00:04:42.670> for<00:04:43.330> not<00:04:43.480> having

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
so you get a great piece for not having

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.380 
so you get a great piece for not having
had<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.020> learn<00:04:44.140> very<00:04:44.380> many<00:04:44.770> notes<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:45.390> it's

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
had to learn very many notes and it's

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.600 
had to learn very many notes and it's
just<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.810> whole<00:04:47.410> lot<00:04:47.440> easier<00:04:47.740> than<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.340> waltz

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
just a whole lot easier than the waltz

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.570 
just a whole lot easier than the waltz
