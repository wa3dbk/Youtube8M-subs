00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
pack a little bit more flavor now I got
some<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> marinara<00:01:22.920> sauce<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> side

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
some of the marinara sauce on the side

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
some of the marinara sauce on the side
and<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.570> tried<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> by<00:01:24.990> itself<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.500> mean<00:01:25.680> it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and I tried it by itself but I mean it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.770 
and I tried it by itself but I mean it's
kind<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> nice<00:01:26.759> Irby<00:01:27.240> taste<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
kind of it has a nice Irby taste to it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.870 
kind of it has a nice Irby taste to it
and<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.890> bit<00:01:29.250> tangy<00:01:29.670> it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and it's kind of a bit tangy it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
and it's kind of a bit tangy it's
definitely<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> bland<00:01:30.600> marinara<00:01:31.079> sauce

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
definitely not a bland marinara sauce

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
definitely not a bland marinara sauce
but<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> same<00:01:32.280> time<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.880> think<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.119> can

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
but at the same time I just think it can

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.399 
but at the same time I just think it can
use<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.570> bit<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.960> kick<00:01:34.170> some

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
use a little bit more of a kick some

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
use a little bit more of a kick some
kind<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.829> spicy<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:35.880> taste<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.750> as

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
kind of a spicy or taste to it but as

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.210 
kind of a spicy or taste to it but as
for<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.079> rest<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> stuff<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.890> standard

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
for the rest of stuff kind of standard

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039
