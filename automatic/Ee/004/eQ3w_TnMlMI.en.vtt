left guard has no one to block so he's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.450

tackle<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> offensive<00:01:31.229> line<00:01:31.590> will

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
you know your opponent's going to pass

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.660 
you know your opponent's going to pass
because<00:03:04.320> if<00:03:04.440> they<00:03:04.650> run<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> ball<00:03:05.190> especially

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
because if they run the ball especially

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.250 
because if they run the ball especially
to<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.300> opposite<00:03:06.660> side<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.959> where<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.230> are

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
to the opposite side of where you are

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
to the opposite side of where you are
they<00:03:07.950> could<00:03:08.100> get<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> touchdown<00:03:08.489> easily<00:03:09.120> so

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
they could get a touchdown easily so

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.180 
they could get a touchdown easily so
that's<00:03:09.630> one<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.080> main<00:03:10.260> weaknesses<00:03:10.770> out<00:03:11.040> of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
that's one of the main weaknesses out of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.400 
that's one of the main weaknesses out of
this<00:03:11.310> defense<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.239> fact<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.810> not

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
this defense is the fact that it's not

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.590 
this defense is the fact that it's not
the<00:03:13.650> best<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.250> stop<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> run<00:03:15.000> if<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.209> don't

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the best on stop in the run if you don't

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.180 
the best on stop in the run if you don't
know<00:03:15.750> how<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.050> stop<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> run<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.800> easily

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
know how to stop the run you can easily

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.100 
know how to stop the run you can easily
lock<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> run<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.269> defense<00:03:18.690> if<00:03:19.049> you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
lock up the run with this defense if you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.810 
lock up the run with this defense if you
know<00:03:19.410> what<00:03:19.530> you're<00:03:19.650> doing<00:03:19.920> another<00:03:20.519> weakness

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
know what you're doing another weakness

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.880 
know what you're doing another weakness
is<00:03:21.239> if<00:03:21.690> your<00:03:21.900> opponent<00:03:22.260> blocks<00:03:22.470> their<00:03:22.680> running

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
is if your opponent blocks their running

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.949 
is if your opponent blocks their running
back<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.280> blitz<00:03:23.519> will<00:03:23.700> not<00:03:23.880> come<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.390> it

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
back the blitz will not come in it

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.390 
back the blitz will not come in it
doesn't<00:03:25.320> matter<00:03:25.470> if<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.830> running<00:03:25.980> backs<00:03:26.220> on

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
doesn't matter if the running backs on

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.460 
doesn't matter if the running backs on
the<00:03:26.640> left<00:03:26.880> or<00:03:27.120> right<00:03:27.450> side<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.019> actually

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the left or right side and you actually

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.870 
the left or right side and you actually
don't<00:03:28.709> even<00:03:28.830> have<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.250> block<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.610> running

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
don't even have to block the running

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.820 
don't even have to block the running
back<00:03:30.030> since<00:03:30.660> we're<00:03:30.870> only<00:03:31.049> blitzing<00:03:31.560> off<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
back since we're only blitzing off the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.530 
back since we're only blitzing off the
right<00:03:32.010> side<00:03:32.040> if<00:03:32.730> you're<00:03:32.910> playing<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.269> smart

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
right side if you're playing a smart

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.660 
right side if you're playing a smart
opponent<00:03:34.019> he's<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.680> gonna<00:03:34.830> slide<00:03:35.190> protect

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
opponent he's just gonna slide protect

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.640 
opponent he's just gonna slide protect
his<00:03:35.790> offensive<00:03:36.180> line<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.630> right<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
his offensive line to the right and the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.050 
his offensive line to the right and the
blitz<00:03:37.860> will<00:03:38.040> not<00:03:38.190> come<00:03:38.400> in<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:38.700> he<00:03:38.820> doesn't

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
blitz will not come in so he doesn't

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.820 
blitz will not come in so he doesn't
even<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.420> block<00:03:39.630> anybody<00:03:39.930> if<00:03:40.320> we're<00:03:40.709> not

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
even have to block anybody if we're not

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.440 
even have to block anybody if we're not
sending<00:03:41.100> any<00:03:41.370> pressure<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.030> left<00:03:42.239> side

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
sending any pressure to the left side

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.780 
sending any pressure to the left side
then<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> blitz<00:03:43.560> becomes<00:03:43.920> very<00:03:44.160> predictable

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
then the blitz becomes very predictable

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.539 
then the blitz becomes very predictable
and<00:03:45.000> easily<00:03:45.510> beaten<00:03:45.840> another<00:03:46.769> huge<00:03:47.100> weakness

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
and easily beaten another huge weakness

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.910 
and easily beaten another huge weakness
is<00:03:47.760> when<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.360> show<00:03:48.600> blitz<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.440> cornerbacks

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
is when you show blitz the cornerbacks

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.220 
is when you show blitz the cornerbacks
on<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.190> outside<00:03:50.580> dropped<00:03:51.060> down<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.420> about<00:03:51.870> six

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
on the outside dropped down to about six

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
on the outside dropped down to about six
yards<00:03:52.380> away<00:03:52.620> from<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.950> receiver<00:03:53.340> if<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.000> have

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
yards away from the receiver if you have

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.789 
yards away from the receiver if you have
a<00:03:54.150> really<00:03:54.480> fast<00:03:54.660> receiver<00:03:55.080> on<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.290> outside

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
a really fast receiver on the outside

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.370 
a really fast receiver on the outside
and<00:03:56.070> not<00:03:56.459> as<00:03:56.640> fast<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.180> cornerback<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.900> they

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
and not as fast of a cornerback and they

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.110 
and not as fast of a cornerback and they
know<00:03:58.530> how<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.680> block<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.130> Blitz<00:03:59.400> well<00:03:59.940> then

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
know how to block the Blitz well then

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.770 
know how to block the Blitz well then
you're<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.330> trouble

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you're in trouble

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.110 
you're in trouble
if<00:04:01.140> only<00:04:01.380> we<00:04:01.620> had<00:04:01.650> defense<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.489> combat<00:04:02.910> all

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
if only we had defense to combat all

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.820 
if only we had defense to combat all
these<00:04:03.390> weaknesses<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.110> just<00:04:04.380> mentioned

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
these weaknesses that I just mentioned

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.490 
these weaknesses that I just mentioned
and<00:04:05.010> luckily<00:04:05.580> we<00:04:05.760> do<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.630> can't<00:04:06.870> slap<00:04:07.140> or<00:04:07.290> tech

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
and luckily we do you can't slap or tech

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.930 
and luckily we do you can't slap or tech
right<00:04:07.769> because<00:04:08.160> we<00:04:08.310> have<00:04:08.430> left-sided

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
right because we have left-sided

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.850 
right because we have left-sided
pressure<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.900> can't<00:04:10.140> block<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.380> running<00:04:10.709> back

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
pressure you can't block a running back

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.770 
pressure you can't block a running back
because<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.340> could<00:04:11.489> get<00:04:11.640> dual<00:04:11.910> left<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.480> right

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
because we could get dual left and right

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.140 
because we could get dual left and right
outside<00:04:12.989> Heat<00:04:13.560> we<00:04:14.070> also<00:04:14.310> have<00:04:14.610> four-man
