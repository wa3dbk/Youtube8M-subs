00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
can be a problem with our nail wraps

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.520 
can be a problem with our nail wraps
adhering<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.370> top

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
adhering right up there at the top

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.319 
adhering right up there at the top
because<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:44.160> nail<00:00:44.550> wrap<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.879> adhering<00:00:45.300> to
