00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.160
 Japanese diet is considered to be a diet 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.880
 was developed in one of Tokyo 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.799
 Clinics therefore got its name 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.599
 however there is an opinion that it is so named 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.449
 because of its rigor and simplicity 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.550
 characteristic just the same for the Japanese so 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 this or otherwise is not too important 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.320
 the main objective of this diet is bringing in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.420
 metabolic rate because weight goes away 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.550
 quite natural and after not 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.949
 returns for a long time when 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 Provided that the menu will not peel 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.260
 differing by excesses it is claimed that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 on the Japanese diet really lose weight by 5 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.910
 or 8 kilos in more 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.180
 this is of course due to the original 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.550
 weighing the rule of the Japanese diet most often 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.800
 14 day diet offered 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.430
 however, there are seven-day options 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.899
 diets and also lasting 13 days 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.530
 short version is not as efficient and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.300
 results in essentially surplus liquid maintenance 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 Japanese diet implies giving up 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.790
 flour alcohol and salt 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.390
 necessary during the diet to drink a lot 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.340

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.950
 a glass of water must be drunk in the morning 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.650
 immediately after waking up in intervals 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.930
 between meals is allowed to drink water but 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.840
 better to do it either before meals or by 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.610
 after at least half an hour after in the menu 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.159
 diets present a large number 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 coffee this drink is necessary because 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.509
 significant amounts of antioxidants 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.909

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.990
