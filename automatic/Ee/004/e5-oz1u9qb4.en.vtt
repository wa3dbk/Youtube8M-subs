00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.469
 the individual side picture today let's 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.460
 talk about the body organization of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.370
 politicians 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.340
 well we've already seen that politicians are 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 animals do not have tissues 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
 and neither systems 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.919
 being the one who exercises most of the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.529
 physiological functions in sponges are the 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.349
 cells and these cells are up 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.140
 considered very independent already 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.600
 draw a sponge and the first cell 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.740
 that I want to show are cells that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 they do here 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.880
 the inner lining of these animals 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.820
 these cells that I'm going to expand here 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.450
 are called color in the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.110
 we have already seen that these cells are 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.140
 cells and on the basis of the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.910
 there are projections that are 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.960
 called micro villi and those with 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.810
 we all have many functions here in the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 sponge body such as these 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.840
 cells perform the bassoon process 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.999
 coughing of food by making digestion 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.929
 which in this case is a digestion 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:24.990
 as we already saw in class 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:28.460
 system of managers and in addition the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.520
 the scourge of these cells 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.270
 circulation of water inside the atrium 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.509
 sponge cavity and this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.109
 water flow is very important for 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.829
 the transport of various substances 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:50.009
 such as nutrient particles 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.409
 written oxygen and carbonic 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.219
 all these products will circulate here 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.189
 with water through the body of the sponge and 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.450
 with us all we also have the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.649
 by oscips 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.079
 the next are cells that are 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.170
 located at the poles of the sponge 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.580
 these cells have a channel 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.830
 center that is where the water will pass 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.460
 bones are so important 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.860
 before cells lining the pores and 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.080
 control the inflow of water into the sponge 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.010
 another cell that is the coating 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.270
 sponge is called pina 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.330
 cosip ospina back are cells 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:43.500
 which are juxtaposed one at a time 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:48.030
 others and these cells are responsible 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.820
 by the external coating of the animal in the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.570
 surface of sponges body 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.780
 we also find ourselves negotiating the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.940
 businesses are cells that have a 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.930
 amoeba format 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.910
 these cells are very 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.570
 important because they are cells 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.740
 totipotent they are capable of 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.250
 originate the other cell types are 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.980
 the stem cells of the sponge and the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.430
 The last cells you want to show are the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.489
 slave wrote them bad too 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.750
 are spread all over the body of the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.870
 animal 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.810
 these cells are responsible for 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.160
 form spicules which are structures 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.000
 very important in the body of the sponge 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.470
 the spicules are skeletal structures 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.870
 microscopic and they can be 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.250
 limestone when they consist of 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.640
 calcium carbonate or silicosis 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.250
 when you are cynical in your constitution 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.610
 and these structures are important 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.060
 because they give more resistance 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.510
 to the animal's body are structures and 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.660
 select homes and it is often possible 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.200
 classify different species of 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.859
 sponges by analyzing these spicules 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.890
 may have varied formats good 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.890
 we ended up here with this lesson and in 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.380
 Next we'll talk about reproduction in 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.380
 politicians do not ask until then
