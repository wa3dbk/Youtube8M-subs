00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.620
 good in this video you will learn how 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.660
 to make a compost in a pet bottle 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.580
 need two identical pet bottles 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:28.230
 same model of preference transforms 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:36.970
 transparent sand stones and earth 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:42.570
 Scissors punch punch or clips 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:46.359
 heated coffee grounds and napkin 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.539
 organic food stalks bark 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.460
 the first step is to cut the bottles 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.859
 one in the form of a container to another in 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.999
 funnel shape 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.309
 soon after piercing the lid of one of these 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:07.120
 cylinders if heated contain 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:10.330
 was the electric box is the same on the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:18.160
 the funnel bottle and then place the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:26.080
 funnel on the stand after you've already 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:27.700
 you can start building your composer 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.040
 of pet bottle 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.730
 first with the layer of stone one 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.240
 layer of sand a layer of earth and there 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.040
 you can put stalks shells 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.670
 fruit vegetables 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.770
 avoid putting meats and cooked foods 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:56.470
 avoid egg shells and may also 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:59.170
 put napkins papers and also stir 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.540
 with a layer of element papers 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 organic papers only playing papers 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.780
 also avoid placing newspapers 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.210
 if you want the production of the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.979
 composting and also the production of 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.290
 which is a superfood that soon 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.080
 I'll explain about it. 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.780
 you must have the last food 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.090
 how it's being shown now 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.319
 you see how manure production more 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.319
 one but what I cry for 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.060
 the slurry is a liquid that when it occurs 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.370
 decomposition of organic food is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.659
 produce and can be used as food 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.120
 for plants 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:37.000
 this cry that is going to be produced must 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.590
 be diluted in a part of a part and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.829
 30 parts of water 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.569
 if it is placed directly on the 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:48.599
 plants could get to die in the last 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.829
 layer puts a place coffee grounds 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:57.639
 to avoid animals in 7 and last 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.949
 place an urban naylon medina or a 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:04.230
 network as shown that for what sells 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:04.230
 not completely but partly
