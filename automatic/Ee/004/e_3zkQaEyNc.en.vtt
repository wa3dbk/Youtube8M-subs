00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.790 
and eventually you want to slide out but
now<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.510> put<00:03:09.720> angle<00:03:10.080> or<00:03:10.170> banking<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
now if you put angle or banking to that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.920 
now if you put angle or banking to that
and<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.160> pull<00:03:11.400> two<00:03:12.090> or<00:03:12.240> three<00:03:12.420> degrees

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and you pull two or three degrees

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.170 
and you pull two or three degrees
lateral<00:03:13.440> G<00:03:13.650> well<00:03:14.490> now<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.760> banking<00:03:15.060> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
lateral G well now that banking is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.610 
lateral G well now that banking is
really<00:03:15.360> helping<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.960> go<00:03:16.110> around<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
really helping you to go around and to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.180 
really helping you to go around and to
the<00:03:16.710> left

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the left

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.450 
the left
banking<00:03:17.880> makes<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.990> car<00:03:19.170> think<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:20.010> driving

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
banking makes the car think it's driving

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.920 
banking makes the car think it's driving
a<00:03:20.490> straighter<00:03:20.790> line<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.780> have<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
a straighter line so if you have a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.170 
a straighter line so if you have a
corner<00:03:22.200> radius<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.400> really<00:03:23.640> tight<00:03:23.880> corner

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
corner radius it's a really tight corner

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180 
corner radius it's a really tight corner
radius<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.630> there's<00:03:24.840> no<00:03:24.990> banking<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:26.160> can

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
radius and there's no banking you can

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.190 
radius and there's no banking you can
only<00:03:26.460> go<00:03:26.640> around<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.000> corner<00:03:27.270> say<00:03:27.720> 50<00:03:28.050> mile

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
only go around that corner say 50 mile

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.170 
only go around that corner say 50 mile
an<00:03:28.350> hour<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:28.800> now<00:03:28.950> take<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.280> similar<00:03:29.700> corner

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
an hour but now take a similar corner

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.900 
an hour but now take a similar corner
radius<00:03:30.330> with<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> high<00:03:31.410> bank<00:03:31.800> in<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> 100<00:03:32.760> mile

you have to turn to the right because

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.750 
you have to turn to the right because

even<00:04:07.200> air<00:04:07.410> helps<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.860> cars<00:04:08.100> turn<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.820> amount

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
next time someone tells you that all

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.200 
next time someone tells you that all
there<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:53.040> driving<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.430> stop<00:04:53.730> car<00:04:54.000> is

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
there is to driving a stop car is

there is to driving a stop car is
turning<00:04:54.540> left<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:55.110> tell<00:04:55.500> them<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.770> takes<00:04:55.890> a

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
turning left you tell them it takes a

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.340 
turning left you tell them it takes a
combination<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.700> tires<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.660> track<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.260> the

combination of tires the track and the
air<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.920> generate<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.460> thousands<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.090> pounds

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
