some metal eyes channels first minutes
of<00:00:28.940> numbing<00:00:29.330> eyedrops<00:00:29.900> just<00:00:30.230> like<00:00:30.380> at<00:00:30.530> the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
of numbing eyedrops just like at the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:49.680 

maybe<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> family<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.989> feet

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.799 

as<00:00:50.109> we<00:00:50.289> treat<00:00:51.359> robbins<00:00:52.359> would<00:00:52.510> immediately

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
as we treat robbins would immediately

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.470 
as we treat robbins would immediately
apply<00:00:53.500> ice<00:00:53.920> back<00:00:54.250> after<00:00:54.699> to<00:00:54.789> make<00:00:54.940> sure<00:00:55.120> Makiki

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
apply ice back after to make sure Makiki

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:07.190 
apply ice back after to make sure Makiki
spin<00:00:55.899> cool<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.680> will<00:01:02.159> notice<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.930> spray

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
spin cool you will notice a little spray

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.460 
spin cool you will notice a little spray
immediately<00:01:08.200> before<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:09.159> after<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:10.090> laser

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
immediately before and after a laser

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.370 
immediately before and after a laser
beam<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.890> cools<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.940> skin<00:01:13.030> as<00:01:13.330> well<00:01:13.360> I<00:01:13.869> think

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
beam that cools the skin as well I think

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:28.880 
beam that cools the skin as well I think
we're<00:01:14.830> going<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.040> start<00:01:15.369> right<00:01:16.119> underneath

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.520 

so<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.550> see<00:01:29.700> an<00:01:29.790> immediate<00:01:30.030> contraction<00:01:31.020> at

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
so we see an immediate contraction at

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.830 
so we see an immediate contraction at
the<00:01:31.650> blood<00:01:31.830> vessel<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:33.120> pretty<00:01:33.480> cool<00:01:33.630> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the blood vessel that's pretty cool this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
the blood vessel that's pretty cool this
right<00:01:34.050> here<00:01:34.260> just<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.010> bit

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.140 

he<00:01:47.909> said<00:01:48.120> this<00:01:48.240> pair<00:01:48.570> mm-hmm

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:00.740 

pretty<00:01:53.150> immediate<00:01:53.630> results

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780 

you<00:02:01.170> can't<00:02:01.410> get<00:02:01.590> bruising<00:02:02.130> from<00:02:02.370> this<00:02:02.550> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you can't get bruising from this and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.630 
you can't get bruising from this and
little<00:02:03.000> swelling<00:02:03.590> not<00:02:04.590> every<00:02:05.160> time<00:02:05.370> you<00:02:05.520> get

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
little swelling not every time you get

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.250 
little swelling not every time you get
bruising<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.420> every<00:02:06.660> patient<00:02:07.080> being

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
bruising but I have every patient being

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:20.750 
bruising but I have every patient being
prepared<00:02:07.980> for<00:02:08.100> one<00:02:08.729> little

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.450 

we<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:21.940> take<00:02:22.060> our<00:02:22.240> time<00:02:22.270> doing<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.080> so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
we just take our time doing that so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.830 
we just take our time doing that so
unlike<00:02:24.460> other<00:02:24.640> laser<00:02:24.910> procedures<00:02:25.450> where<00:02:25.690> it's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
unlike other laser procedures where it's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.000 
unlike other laser procedures where it's
depth<00:02:26.500> at<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.460> zap<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:29.170> have<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.560> kind<00:02:29.950> of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
depth at that zap we have to kind of

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.330 
depth at that zap we have to kind of
take<00:02:30.220> our<00:02:30.640> time<00:02:30.970> because<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.600> big<00:02:32.500> target

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
take our time because this big target

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.060 
take our time because this big target
here<00:02:33.490> was<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> gets<00:02:33.910> heated<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:35.070> cause

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
here was it gets heated up it can cause

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.760 
here was it gets heated up it can cause
some<00:02:36.250> damage<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.880> skin<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.590> should

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
some damage to the skin so this should

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.530 
some damage to the skin so this should
only<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:39.040> done<00:02:39.160> by<00:02:39.700> someone<00:02:40.150> who's<00:02:40.270> very

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
only be done by someone who's very

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.490 
only be done by someone who's very
experienced<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.890> laser<00:02:43.110> treatments<00:02:44.110> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
experienced in laser treatments and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.180 
experienced in laser treatments and
should<00:02:44.890> only<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:45.130> done<00:02:45.370> with<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> corrective

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
should only be done with the corrective

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.790 
should only be done with the corrective
protective<00:02:48.190> eye<00:02:48.340> here<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:49.090> place<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.680> we

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
protective eye here in place and we

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.010 
protective eye here in place and we
can't<00:02:51.040> get<00:02:51.250> every<00:02:51.580> single<00:02:52.000> one<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.390> typically

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
can't get every single one it typically

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:06.959 
can't get every single one it typically
takes<00:02:53.970> two<00:02:54.970> treatments<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.570> get<00:02:55.720> very<00:02:55.960> good

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
take that a night shield now you just

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.150 
take that a night shield now you just
feel<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.350> pressure

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
feel a little pressure

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.580 
feel a little pressure

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
contact lenses we have to take those out

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.420 
contact lenses we have to take those out
with<00:03:26.290> these<00:03:26.710> in<00:03:27.390> thanks<00:03:28.390> 1<00:03:29.020> Middleton<00:03:29.500> oqz<00:03:30.040> but

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.170 
with these in thanks 1 Middleton oqz but
it<00:03:30.550> can<00:03:30.760> show<00:03:31.120> up<00:03:31.300> later<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.610> bruise<00:03:33.850> does

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
it can show up later if a bruise does

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.910 
it can show up later if a bruise does
happen<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.630> typically<00:03:34.990> will<00:03:35.230> last<00:03:35.410> about<00:03:35.680> a
