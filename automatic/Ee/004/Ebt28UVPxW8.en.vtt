one<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> main<00:02:00.570> reasons<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.410> is<00:02:01.620> believed

one of the main reasons this is believed
to<00:02:02.160> work<00:02:02.370> so<00:02:02.790> well<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.570> sugar<00:02:04.230> gliders

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to work so well is because sugar gliders

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.310 
to work so well is because sugar gliders
are<00:02:04.860> naturally<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> colony<00:02:06.240> animal<00:02:06.810> which

are naturally a colony animal which

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.620 
are naturally a colony animal which
basically<00:02:07.830> means<00:02:08.310> they<00:02:08.550> instinctively<00:02:09.030> want

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
basically means they instinctively want

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.560 
basically means they instinctively want
to<00:02:09.840> bond<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.380> group<00:02:10.860> or<00:02:11.070> an<00:02:11.580> entire<00:02:11.880> family

to bond to a group or an entire family
this<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.320> especially<00:02:13.890> true<00:02:14.160> when<00:02:15.030> they<00:02:15.150> are

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
this is especially true when they are

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.270 
this is especially true when they are

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
two animals are the same so you should

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.240 
two animals are the same so you should
always<00:02:27.300> use<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.660> lot<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.260> caution<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.950> go

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
always use a lot of caution and go

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.780 
always use a lot of caution and go
slowly<00:02:29.850> when<00:02:30.720> introducing<00:02:31.440> any<00:02:31.740> new<00:02:31.980> pets<00:02:32.490> to

video on bonding many pets bond largely
by<00:02:39.540> smell<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.800> first<00:02:41.070> step<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.580> usually

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
by smell so the first step is usually

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.600 
by smell so the first step is usually
take<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> couple<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.660> pieces<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.200> cloth<00:02:43.460> rub<00:02:44.460> it

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
take a couple of pieces of cloth rub it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.150 
take a couple of pieces of cloth rub it
all<00:02:44.850> over<00:02:44.880> each<00:02:45.390> animal<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.170> then<00:02:46.710> give<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
all over each animal and then give it to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.910 
all over each animal and then give it to
each<00:02:47.190> other<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:48.390> scent<00:02:48.750> transfer<00:02:49.380> technique

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
each other this scent transfer technique

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.670 
each other this scent transfer technique
is<00:02:50.190> used<00:02:50.460> with<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> lot<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.180> pets<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:52.200> safely

is used with a lot of pets and it safely

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.590 
is used with a lot of pets and it safely
allows<00:02:53.070> them<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.580> start<00:02:53.850> getting<00:02:54.270> used<00:02:54.450> to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
allows them to start getting used to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.680 
allows them to start getting used to
each<00:02:54.810> other<00:02:55.080> smell<00:02:55.560> without<00:02:56.450> risking<00:02:57.450> a

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
days of doing this the next step is

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.440 
days of doing this the next step is
usually<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.040> try<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.580> introduce<00:03:05.880> them<00:03:06.420> to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
usually to try and introduce them to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.250 
usually to try and introduce them to

humans<00:03:41.010> too<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.270> talk<00:03:42.510> about<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:43.020> more

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
humans too and we talk about that more

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.840 
humans too and we talk about that more
in<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.380> video<00:03:43.620> about<00:03:43.980> bonding<00:03:45.350> now<00:03:46.730> when<00:03:47.730> it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
in the video about bonding now when it

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.580 
in the video about bonding now when it
comes<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.180> introducing<00:03:48.870> them<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.350> first

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
comes to introducing them for the first

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.640 
comes to introducing them for the first
time<00:03:49.920> usually<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.030> best<00:03:51.270> way<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.600> do<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.170> is

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
time usually the best way to do this is

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.430 
time usually the best way to do this is
just<00:03:53.130> place<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.820> gliders<00:03:54.270> cage<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.110> floor

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
just place the gliders cage on the floor

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.830 
just place the gliders cage on the floor
and<00:03:55.769> then<00:03:56.550> allow<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.910> other<00:03:57.330> animal

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
and then allow the other animal

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.560 
and then allow the other animal
preferably<00:03:58.530> on<00:03:58.560> some<00:03:58.980> type<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.250> leash<00:03:59.670> to<00:04:00.330> come

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
preferably on some type of leash to come

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.280 
preferably on some type of leash to come
up<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.019> sniff<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.650> cage<00:04:02.030> now<00:04:03.030> like<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.989> said

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
up and sniff the cage now like I said

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.320 
up and sniff the cage now like I said
when<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.070> happens<00:04:05.580> don't<00:04:05.820> be<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.060> bit

when this happens don't be a bit

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.950 
when this happens don't be a bit
surprised<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:07.250> rather<00:04:08.250> than<00:04:08.580> run<00:04:08.880> your<00:04:09.450> little

sugar glider stands up on the tie legs
and<00:04:12.690> that

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
and that

the charges at the other animal making a

the charges at the other animal making a
big<00:04:16.109> fuss

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
big fuss

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.849 
big fuss
if<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.459> happens<00:04:17.970> don't<00:04:18.329> worry<00:04:18.630> it's<00:04:19.500> all

if this happens don't worry it's all

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.280 
if this happens don't worry it's all
just<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.310> natural<00:04:20.850> part<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.239> their<00:04:21.750> them

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
just a natural part of their them

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.040 
just a natural part of their them
establishing<00:04:23.100> dominance<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.850> sometimes<00:04:24.780> it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
establishing dominance and sometimes it
