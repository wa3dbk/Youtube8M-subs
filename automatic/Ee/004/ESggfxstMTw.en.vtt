00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.620
 remember pebble china explains that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.520
 magic of the father of baby akira toriyama 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.440
 however said recently in a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.660
 interview that in fact yoshi does not have 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.460
 100% reason is that do you and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.479
 rather a magic entity that would exist 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 since the dawn of time 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.200
 in fact the father of baby dee would be 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.119
 rather fell on it a bit by chance 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.950
 but he was able to control it 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.310
 thanks to his magical powers out of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.619
 common 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.159
 Now why is called after boom 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.890
 I remember that we have boo dhabi and his 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:30.170
 father bibi lille what gives us baby

 it is belgium where I do not know 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.400
 not baby baby boom 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.320
 yes his name is neither more nor less 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.220
 a reference to the most famous formula 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.630
 walt disney baby baby magic 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.430
 in fact nothing and giving his features 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.350
 da common by dakar toriyama to give 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.750
 a theme for a category of his 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.009
 characters for example in Japanese all 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.229
 the scenes have names that make 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.360
 reference to vegetables and saw that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.740
 everything revolves around magic it's 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.649
 understandable that he made this choice 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.080
 first of all to although he looks like 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.780
 dracula and that his name sounds a little 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.110
 little like dracula but actually not 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.459
 at all its name just comes from 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.430
 abracadabra 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.380
 abracadabra finally at jean phi phi is 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.650
 a magical incantation well known to 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.140
 japan under the name of well then and so 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.850
 we stay in the theme of magic 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.140
 we come to the end of this video 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.489

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.900
