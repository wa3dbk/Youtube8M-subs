00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.599
 hello vialis his diary of asean dic 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.850
 and so I take advantage of the nokia world that is 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 unfolds in Abu Dhabi to propose a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 little grip of all new 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.500
 we're going to say fable is from nokia so had 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.090
 lumia 13.1 and lumia 15 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.590
 so we start with the high-end one 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.420
 which interests us since 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 share between geeks 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.500
 so if we understand well if we look 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.059
 well this 15 20 in terms of design there 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.399
 takes exactly the design we 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.340
 already knows with the old 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.410
 old smartphones like the 920 no 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.809
 earlier the 925 marquee which 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.899
 will take over the design 1925 and in 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.640
 more with a soft shell 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.719
 touch as on say no it's 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.430
 rather nice and I prefer that to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.539
 glossy due to 920 carbohydrates 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.649
 at the level of the features down you 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.660
 know them already so it's mostly 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.309
 the 6-inch screen that surprises since 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.290
 it's one of the first 6-inch screens 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.729
 if not the first 6-inch screen 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.689
 under windows phone with mostly a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.820
 full hd resolution 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.310
 as you know when windows exit 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.909
 phone 8 there were only resolutions 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.970
 hd ready so 720p 720p is so happy 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.890
 it was 1280 by 720 x 1280 by 765 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.439
 768 sorry so here we end up with 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.909
 a full hd resolution and the advantage 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.979
 of a big screen goal these convoys 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.140
 devices a third column of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.880
 content will allow us to enjoy a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369
 little more shortcuts on your screens 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.060
 I was able to race the lines he has a 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.350
 little video a little trailer and we can 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 see in fact so I do not know what he 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.149
 will be of course the senses but the screen 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.330
 is very very nice fan I hope that 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:00.500
 it's a screen 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:03.260
 but it's a little the volume of arrivals 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.680
 who follows the wii so I told you 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.000
 it's a lcd ip screen is so I 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.100
 do not know if we see well on the video 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.850
 but in terms of color rendering I 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.680
 I'm pretty bluffed I wish I had 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.410
 the outside and into his hands or 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.820
 to forget the ex nador I have not there 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.860
 currently to be able to compare but 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.650
 I am quite amazed by the quality of 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.780
 the screen and so here in terms of 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.860
 finish 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.420
 it's pretty classic so it's a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.040
 good finish pop in shell in 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.270
 polycarbonate and star are so here 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.680
 above there is no big step 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.920
 novelties we find the buttons 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.110
 physical that knows its completion 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.050
 point 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.240
 here we are down we see there so we 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.850
 find buttons buttons 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.310
 classic and especially big novelty 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.350
 suddenly in quotation marks for them for 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.920
 the diam's versions and that's nokia so 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.320
 plus an internal memo specific to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.390
 about a microsd port so here's what 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.830
 so now not really because 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.920
 the craft on the last weekends of 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.080
 caterpillars and from nokia 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.450
 so the 920 the 905 telling me there is 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.060
 had no microsd port while there 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.950
 was on means serves models 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.180
 entry level mid range so there 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.860
 we find them and it is rather pleasant 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.750
 and I think it's a bit normal seen 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.769
 the use we can have of the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.030
 nine athletes next in orange so with 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.100
 a slightly less good finish but 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.390
 rather rather correct anyway since 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.400
 fold the other creams this coating 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.709
 soft touch on a shell in 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.910
 polycarbonate with a design a whole 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.610
 little bit round so who is speaking 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.120
 by which more is addressed more to the big one 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.130
 public 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.170
 so we always find a screen of 6 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.810
 inch but this time she only at a 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.370
 resolution of only 1280 720p 720p 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.840
 it's not so bad it's when we 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.430
 look very closely avoid having a 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.730
 difference between full hd and hd 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.650
 ready 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.680
 but in absolute terms it did not shock me 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.310
 beyond measure in terms of processors 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.860
 That's good 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.920
 we come back to the dual core as 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.870
 what we already knew with the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.319
 the present smartphones like the 920 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.060
 925 and a apn of only 5 megapixels 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.050
 while I just told you everything 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.630
 on time for the fifteen years we get 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.519
 found with an apn of 2 20 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.230
 megapixels and over technology 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.419
 sampling so it's a little worse than 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.280
 it makes the curve youmzain 2 - 10 loop 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.290
 20 saying there were seven pixels that 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.940
 could create a ma pixel here I have not 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.919
 the exact number but it must 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.080
 be 3 or 4 xl that will be able to create a 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.590
 super pixels that can allow you 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.139
 so to go out and our photos in 5 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.490
 megapixels in terms of news 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.800
 statuary is not much new 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.950
 since we find nokia pro cannes two 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.720
 this morning calm star case and found 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.970
 in fact because the only dose word tc 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.030
 storyteller making it an application 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.820
 which will allow you to make albums 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.650
 photos according to geolocation 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.720
 of time and so will it's not it's 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.370
 rather nice I could see that and we can 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.990
 export directly to the new 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.760
 tablet the 25 20 and then here is no 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.050
 great thing special on that side 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.250
 after the windows experience no it's 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.090
 true that a third column is not 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.430
 very bad 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.990
 but but the experience remains the 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.240
 even that's still nice 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.060
 when you know he's going to arrive 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.500
 instagram also oc valves so the reviews 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.160
 when this apps start 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.950
 finally to arrive 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.660
 and I hope that it will stop 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.430
 that it continues a forgiveness 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.080
 for me it would miss more than dropbox 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.820
 to tell me that there I could I 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.940
 could potentially be used to 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.860
 100% a windows phone here I think 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.750
 that I almost deaf to his 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.190
 two new smartphones thank you very much 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.760
 for your attention and very quickly on 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.760
 the geek's newspaper
