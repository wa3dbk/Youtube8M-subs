ones so we're going to push it in and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.460 
ones so we're going to push it in and
we're<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.270> cut<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.660> through<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:45.470> to

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
we're going to cut it through and to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.840 
we're going to cut it through and to
connect<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.920> two<00:02:47.070> parts<00:02:47.459> you're<00:02:47.610> actually

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
connect the two parts you're actually

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.490 
connect the two parts you're actually
going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> get<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> little<00:02:48.750> bit<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.020> water<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
going to get a little bit of water and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.520 
going to get a little bit of water and
just<00:02:49.739> dampen<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.880> two<00:02:51.630> parts<00:02:52.020> with<00:02:52.230> water

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
just dampen the two parts with water

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710 
just dampen the two parts with water
just<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.280> little<00:02:53.580> bit<00:02:53.760> then<00:02:54.120> connect<00:02:54.540> them

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
just a little bit then connect them

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.530 
just a little bit then connect them
together<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.120> push<00:02:57.360> it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
together just like that and push it

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.070 
together just like that and push it
through<00:02:58.850> I'm<00:02:59.850> going<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> beautify<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.840> just

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
through I'm going to beautify it in just

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.000 
through I'm going to beautify it in just
a<00:03:01.230> moment<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.640> roll<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.090> up<00:03:03.209> again<00:03:03.799> push<00:03:04.799> it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
a moment then I roll it up again push it

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.690 
a moment then I roll it up again push it
in<00:03:05.299> roll<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.570> up<00:03:06.720> push<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.880> roll<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.060> up
