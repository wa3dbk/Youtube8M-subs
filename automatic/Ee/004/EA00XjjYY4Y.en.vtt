00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.250
 and welcome cesam this lesson 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.199
 to learn a simple song 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.640
 for the beginners of jack white who 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.559
 is called their interruption 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.730
 we will not dwell too much on 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.379
 chords because probably you 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 already know what we will do is 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.220
 his theory of rhythm that is 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.220
 this style a little complicated like that 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 and we will take time on the hand 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.680
 right for you to learn to the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.019
 break down and remake them after 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 of ear ok so I'm just showing you the 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.180
 agreements so stupidly a mid deal 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.260
 major an agreement the only major one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.899
 agreement of the major 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.579
 and an agreement from him that's for the 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.409
 verses there are several and then 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.390
 the chorus is him 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.130
 single ride 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.689
 the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.130
 ok this is for the left hand if you have 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.329
 worries with the chords that you do not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.039
 do not know yet I propose to go 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.450
 on the site of hammams guitar tu 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.179
 see there are all and everything explained 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.880
 finger by new chord and chord 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.500
 course so what we will do is 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.640
 linger on the right hand to get 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.159
 continue 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.130
 so this riff he he needs two 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.110
 measures so twice 4 times and we're going 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.119
 break them down one after another for 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.890
 that you learn to play them so we go 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.709
 to do it empty means we're going 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.640
 will prevent the bodies from sowing and then 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.200
 we will do it all slowly 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.659
 together so I'm going to count four 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.299
 time if you have not done the courses of 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.119
 rhythmic you can we'll do a brief 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.310
 so summary costs 1 2 3 4 are made 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.289
 against down 3.4 and between these numbers 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.500
 we will help me and who are against 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.959
 water 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.229
 so that's very little 3 and that's a 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:11.860
 measure so for the the first part 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.260
 of the measure we will hit the times 1 3 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:22.989
 the last is therefore the lack of 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:26.560
 practices done 1 2 3 4 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:32.980
 and one and two and three and four 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.620
 and one and two and three and cleared face to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.120
 face who has not heard anything from ariane 1 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.519
 and 2 es3 es4 head that's for the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.130
 first measure is the second measure 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:52.959
 we will do the 1 and 2 3 1 and 2 and 3 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.849
 sometimes we can do the last m 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.260
 it's not mandatory so if you 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.430
 learn now was displayed the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.169
 frankly do you think has ever since 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.269
 the beginning so we'll do it all 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.099
 gently together you will be able to do 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.470
 with less and so we'll go there FrÃ©mont 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.700
 soft to try to stall this rhythm 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.700
 on cm on these two measures 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:28.310
 what 4 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 1 2 3 and 2 and 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.349
 you're done again five times 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.299
 and then we will reach an agreement on that 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:42.769
 we see a little bit faster 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:44.329
 1 l 2 and 3 and 4 and 2 we make them a 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.459
 times with this time a half agreement 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.459
 so 1 and 2 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.240
 you 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.030
 cleat so now you know how to make 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.710
 pretty much everything we'll do a hair a 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.190
 every little bit faster we change the 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.190
 agreements one and two and three and four 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.280
 he 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.849
 you 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.710
 ok and here we are so you know how to do 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.750
 the first part of this song the 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.010
 chorus you can play the same thing in 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.010
 changing the chords in the middle you 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.840
 I'll suggest you do not see again 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.030
 quite in detail his doctor aps the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.890
 mans play it with jack white and 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.960
 make chord changes on 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.610
 time like that you can become 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.440
 soon a king of the bright conf etc 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.950
 to the jack white style which is not a 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.340
 thin affair 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.510
 I wish you a lot of pleasure 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.550
 learn this song that is really 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.720
 nice and it's easy once you 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.920
 will have the rhythm in the skin you will see 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.810
 it means alone you can sing 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.770
 it's better than me and I should 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.870

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.940

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.070
 on my site lsa guitar for a block 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.720
 either point ch or point fr it works 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.880
 as well 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.650
