00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
first of all but you know it's very good

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.340 
first of all but you know it's very good
to<00:01:40.550> drivers<00:01:41.030> well<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.330> handling<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:41.810> fine<00:01:42.020> so

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
to drivers well the handling is fine so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.430 
to drivers well the handling is fine so
it's<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:42.710> right<00:01:42.950> it's<00:01:43.220> not<00:01:43.400> out<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:43.700> balance

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
it's just right it's not out of balance

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.550 
it's just right it's not out of balance
you<00:01:45.440> know<00:01:45.590> in<00:01:45.740> other<00:01:46.630> other<00:01:47.630> cars<00:01:47.930> sometimes

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
you know in other other cars sometimes

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.350 
you know in other other cars sometimes
have<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> feeling<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.520> bit<00:01:49.670> lazy<00:01:49.880> or<00:01:50.180> it's

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
have the feeling is a bit lazy or it's

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.120 
have the feeling is a bit lazy or it's
too<00:01:50.510> aggressive<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:51.110> can't<00:01:51.350> really<00:01:51.650> put<00:01:52.010> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
too aggressive you can't really put it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.740 
too aggressive you can't really put it
on<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.370> track<00:01:52.550> but<00:01:52.820> here<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.270> balance<00:01:53.630> is

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
on the track but here the balance is

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.770 
on the track but here the balance is
just<00:01:54.020> right<00:01:54.230> and<00:01:54.500> as<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:55.010> said<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.580> grip<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:56.120> a

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
just right and as I said the grip is a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.410 
just right and as I said the grip is a
new<00:01:57.020> dimension<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.890> all<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.490> makes<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.090> so

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
new dimension so all of that makes it so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.889 
new dimension so all of that makes it so
enjoy

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.839 

yeah<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.590> was<00:02:09.739> going<00:02:09.950> too<00:02:10.159> quick<00:02:10.189> I<00:02:10.610> thought

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
yeah it was going too quick I thought

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.429 
yeah it was going too quick I thought
okay<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.390> know<00:02:11.569> we<00:02:11.780> were<00:02:11.989> talking<00:02:12.170> about

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
okay you know we were talking about

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.580 
okay you know we were talking about
speeds<00:02:12.829> around<00:02:12.980> 400<00:02:13.760> so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
speeds around 400 so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.229 
speeds around 400 so
went<00:02:16.590> around<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.040> Nurburgring<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.879> think<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
went around the Nurburgring I think the

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.410 
went around the Nurburgring I think the
first<00:02:18.390> time<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.049> was<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:20.299> you<00:02:21.299> know

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
first time and it was a you know

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.569 
first time and it was a you know
straight<00:02:21.749> away<00:02:21.780> 20<00:02:22.560> or<00:02:22.709> 30<00:02:22.920> seconds<00:02:23.430> quicker

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
straight away 20 or 30 seconds quicker

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.160 
straight away 20 or 30 seconds quicker
than<00:02:23.819> i<00:02:23.969> was<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.659> real<00:02:24.900> formula

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
than i was in the in the real formula

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.270 
than i was in the in the real formula
one<00:02:25.439> car<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:27.599> was<00:02:27.749> quite<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.049> surprise<00:02:28.290> how

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
one car so it was quite a surprise how

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.569 
one car so it was quite a surprise how
how<00:02:29.849> fast<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.719> price<00:02:30.959> cutter<00:02:31.469> you<00:02:32.310> really

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
how fast the price cutter you really

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.759 
how fast the price cutter you really
need<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:32.969> into<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.450> how<00:02:34.139> late<00:02:34.439> you<00:02:34.590> can

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
need to get into it how late you can

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.190 
need to get into it how late you can
break<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.430> still<00:02:35.700> pass<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.750> window<00:02:37.079> in

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
break and then still pass the window in

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.979 
break and then still pass the window in
the<00:02:37.319> corners<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.359> it's<00:02:39.359> really<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.719> very

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
