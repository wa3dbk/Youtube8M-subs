00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.770
 all boys first Marx and that's not my gm-plans I would like to do that 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.210
 say first 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.479
 that's one while he's getting it from my friends 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.369
 and that's where wonderful meets 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.919
 many of you wanted to see Geneva in the world and many of you 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.919
 wanted to see the self-propelled helicopter 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.039
 yes and how good that there is in the theater mode 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.030
 he had a terrific team at home 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.780
 and has exactly in those two things in it all wanted to see 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.660
 comment on the right of way of this happy princess 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.410
 and from wages 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.450
 The beautiful thing about the theater mode is that it can be used without any problems 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.130
 change 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.830
 The Seven Bars had lain down until there were a couple of attempts 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.600
 I needed that now so she had taken 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.550
 As I said, I do it that way 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.370
 I am here 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.140
 Run in theater mode 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.870
 Companies are in the disaster on Sunday mode it runs when their 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.990
 Parents are not in the easiest way 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.990
 everything still works well as bought then 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.500
 only theater mode laborious to do that because you have to look 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 like the OStA horses they would have cattle and Antonov and then comment 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.730
 Rapper and producer the VIG 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.990
 that's all about 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.210
 not so great 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.980
 but that's a nice sparkle 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.250
 he said he partly has tag in this video and wanted to be a first 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.150
 do not hurry to show that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.710
 however, in Alberta the hosts like to see m14 Gampel and 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.119
 because that describe helicopter, he then gave a jerk said yes 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:34.890
 but 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.340
 then from lol us market 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.900
 around us, Susanne Game has released the map the first market shimmer where it 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.120
 's at 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.420
 but today very well pure 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.860
 our guesses 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.040
 GM 14 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.160
 to 2 with in my opinion is after two hearts 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.120
 on the upper body 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.230
 and higher 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.500
 and around a swimmer is fast out of the air also quite okay 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.570
 + on the Middle Rhine 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.720
 around 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.320
 Doros attaching so good are a bit 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.290
 we are weak 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.509
 the gameplay is going around 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.839
 so for the seven minutes 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.119
 and that the CDIs of Cinquecento did not make the advance payment 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.109
 at the end 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.549
 around 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.069
 These are my GPS he can not tell what he is doing now 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.369
 think and do and routes 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.449
 around page that we are so extremely careful on everything 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.069
 but that is probably a father that he has no regrets Bremer looks 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.989
 and around 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.510
 I wanted to get a little bit of other stuff from the first video band 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.019
 so said but have the easier one once the gm plans of mine 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.829
 gameplay videos- 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.829
 the Modern Yahoo 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.659
 You see, too, "which is just good 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.239
 yes, I'm going to rest a bit when he's late 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.239
 until 11 pm again skype both go 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.139
 Many have said I should not do too much though 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.749
 that's why we need the money a bit more 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.629
 to stand by 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:24.229
 to the weatherman shining me on the next appointment a few videos something 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.079
 Leave a Comment 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.129
 that planned with him Rolf Pohlig 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.129
 However, the country got Black Ops the Gastein 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.220
 the Killstreaks testify here like helicopters around Rosses he holds by the head 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.439
 damn long 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.379
 when it is completed the system I am there and eventually people leave 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.919
 This is far Mister reliable people from now on the Harrier 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.759
 for example, Modern Warfare 2 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.499
 So that's up to 10 something else 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.309
 but if I'm better for the Killstreaks they generally do 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:59.559
 much better 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:03.019
 Dieter is worth it is very important of the cool kills nothing 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.209
 like the Blackbird or like the love the dogs like Lausanne like the wound 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.619
 as we play the game with the best odds 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.519
 but I do not take the world games now because he wanted it all 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.810
 Clear Merkel's Rixe in Liberec in a next show of course 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.069
 Pablo hole in the video 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.430
 during the flight off worth squad 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.690
 with percent of customers in close-ups and in theatrical fashion theater mode 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.569
 Listen to this in peace and look like you see the dogs like gall 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.569
 actually are 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.879
 I'll just go racing after that 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 he is mature 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.979
 now comes the place where lives for you to describe why 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.020
 I wanted to have picked up 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.220
 if I do that ABDA tries to be bloody Nele Koch out of it 20 times 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.400
 all i pull my best to episode also tells as is a really just 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.069
 by 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.189
 in such a part of the DHV use our view 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:18.179
 Especially since the food is the watt and around so many planners remain so 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.180
 on the map multi you have the problem that many buildings are there 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.630
 Villar former 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.629
 Inga the one with Hermann a worse Mertes 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.279
 very angled he partly misjudges 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.279
 The other March Netbooks still like very high levels actually 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.199
 it is the question I think that is a matter of taste if that is better 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.199
 the round 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.199
 the dogs are all feathers genetic material 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.410
 The dogs are then again on Lucia much poorer Kurt Weill go 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.279
 Building parts otherwise what for example Machine UKE trust 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.609
 there the thing is definitely better than the round 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.310
 because percent so and of course play mode plays around without Bonn Timo 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:03.580
 and 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.060
 When they put me in the building and the game is already full, everything is open 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.360
 Sound so Topp organs or her son 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.580
 Fox and protect all 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.960
 Of course, better another looks right back again all here 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.979
 path 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.310
 The Yucatan printeria idea is much better 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.580
 Reinmann Shopper Ghana on air shows it again recorded but knows that 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.139
 you look at Nintendo 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.930
 that was not to know where the money was worth now 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.159
 All this has resulted 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.629
 but Hughes Trauner makes norm without problems 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.439
 at 10 15 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.439
 Kilz or even more rub the skin 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.969
 that he's butter helium 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:41.939
 around 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.069
 now he will die at once because you can see exactly where 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.430
 Situation the gameplay 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.080
 He did not miss the first one that contains them is not that good 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.380
 but that would have left a fourth and thus end the game with 30 to 1 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.029
 what is really a super around 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:02.600
 Super points super 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.339
 Keeps the fresh air and is in the mountain country 

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:07.499
 because the big water pack 

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.520
 he is he has moved Â»at least I know personally 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.969
 So I think so super power and 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.309
 yes I hope people want to see because they will be around soon 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:18.119
 come 

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:19.629
 until then it starts off well
