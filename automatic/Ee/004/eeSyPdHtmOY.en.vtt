00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
with this you can take up a needle and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.020 
with this you can take up a needle and
pull<00:02:54.770> out<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.100> corners<00:02:55.490> so<00:02:55.520> they're<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:55.880> little

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
pull out the corners so they're a little

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.470 
pull out the corners so they're a little
bit<00:02:56.240> crisper<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:58.250> I'm<00:02:58.940> going<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.180> put<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
bit crisper so I'm going to put the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.360 
bit crisper so I'm going to put the
cushion<00:02:59.840> in<00:02:59.990> and<00:03:00.230> I'm<00:03:00.770> going<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> make<00:03:01.160> sure

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
cushion in and I'm going to make sure

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.740 
cushion in and I'm going to make sure
that<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.760> ties<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.770> top<00:03:04.010> are<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.390> open

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
that the ties on the top are in the open

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.350 
that the ties on the top are in the open
end<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:07.160> it's<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:07.850> putting<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.300> a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.000 
end so it's just like putting on a
pillowcase<00:03:10.000> shake<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.150> down<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.390> little<00:03:11.600> bit

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010

it's a little bit snug and that's what
you<00:03:14.600> want<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.990> don't<00:03:15.080> want<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.350> tight<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:15.890> you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
fits really nicely now the next step is

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.090

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
ties that are on the cushion so we have

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.860 
ties that are on the cushion so we have
to<00:03:31.100> use<00:03:31.220> our<00:03:31.340> seam<00:03:31.640> ripper<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:31.970> make<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.510> little

small<00:03:33.200> little<00:03:33.230> hole<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.130> can<00:03:34.280> pull

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
small little hole so that we can pull

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.460 
small little hole so that we can pull
the<00:03:34.580> ties<00:03:34.790> out<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.510> we'll<00:03:36.200> do<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.500> now<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.440> I

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
the ties out and we'll do that now so I

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.770 
the ties out and we'll do that now so I
just<00:03:39.800> felt<00:03:40.190> through<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.820> fabric<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.600> where

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
just felt through the fabric to where

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.100 
just felt through the fabric to where
the<00:03:41.930> ties<00:03:42.140> come<00:03:43.130> out<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:44.330> used<00:03:44.630> my<00:03:44.810> seam

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
the ties come out and I used my seam

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.740 
the ties come out and I used my seam
ripper<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:46.160> just<00:03:46.430> opened<00:03:46.820> up<00:03:46.910> like<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.360> like

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
ripper and I just opened up like in like

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.690 
ripper and I just opened up like in like
an<00:03:47.930> inch<00:03:48.260> or<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.010> see<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.280> there<00:03:49.340> just

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
an inch or so can you see it there just

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.040 
an inch or so can you see it there just
like<00:03:49.790> an<00:03:49.970> inch<00:03:50.120> or<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.360> made<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.600> little<00:03:50.780> hole

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
like an inch or so I made a little hole

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.900 
like an inch or so I made a little hole
with<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.530> seam<00:03:51.739> ripper<00:03:52.040> just<00:03:52.280> by<00:03:52.400> taking<00:03:52.670> out

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
with the seam ripper just by taking out

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.910 
with the seam ripper just by taking out
some<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.330> stitches<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.680> could

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
some of the stitches so that I could

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.630 
some of the stitches so that I could
pull<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.400> ties<00:03:55.670> right<00:03:56.180> through<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:58.430> like

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
pull the ties right through see like

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.300 
pull the ties right through see like
that<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.209> then<00:03:59.900> I<00:03:59.930> did<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.290> same<00:04:00.500> thing<00:04:00.560> up<00:04:01.070> at

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
that and then I did the same thing up at

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.660 
that and then I did the same thing up at
the<00:04:01.459> top<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.750> slit<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.650> slit<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> few<00:04:04.489> of<00:04:04.580> the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the top I just slit a slit a few of the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.640 
the top I just slit a slit a few of the
stitches<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.330> I<00:04:05.420> can<00:04:05.750> pull<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.140> ties<00:04:06.350> right

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
stitches and I can pull the ties right

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.710 
stitches and I can pull the ties right
through<00:04:07.010> now<00:04:07.580> what<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.880> might<00:04:08.090> want<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:08.390> do<00:04:08.570> is

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
through now what you might want to do is

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.140 
through now what you might want to do is
you<00:04:08.870> might<00:04:09.019> want<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.380> take<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.340> take<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.940> ties

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
you might want to take the take the ties

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.990 
you might want to take the take the ties
back<00:04:11.480> out<00:04:11.720> take<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.320> cushion<00:04:12.650> out<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:13.040> turn

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
back out take the cushion out and turn

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.570 
back out take the cushion out and turn
it<00:04:14.120> back<00:04:14.150> inside<00:04:14.690> out<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.110> reinforce<00:04:15.950> where

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
it back inside out and reinforce where

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.520 
it back inside out and reinforce where
you<00:04:16.730> you<00:04:17.419> know<00:04:17.540> cut<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.930> stitches<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.380> that

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
you you know cut the stitches so that

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.680 
you you know cut the stitches so that
they<00:04:18.769> don't<00:04:18.890> come<00:04:19.160> loose<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.549> either<00:04:19.700> side<00:04:20.030> but

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
they don't come loose on either side but

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.180 
they don't come loose on either side but
it's<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:20.989> simple<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.680> doesn't<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:22.100> look

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
it's that simple and it doesn't it look

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.250 
it's that simple and it doesn't it look
like<00:04:22.370> it's<00:04:22.580> custom<00:04:23.120> now<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.810> only<00:04:23.990> thing<00:04:24.230> we

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
like it's custom now the only thing we

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.279 
like it's custom now the only thing we
have<00:04:24.500> left<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.400> finish<00:04:25.640> is<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.090> top<00:04:26.539> so<00:04:27.140> we're

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
have left to finish is the top so we're

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.980 
have left to finish is the top so we're
going<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.440> I'm<00:04:27.620> going<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.770> show<00:04:27.919> you<00:04:27.950> that<00:04:28.190> next

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
going to I'm going to show you that next

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.100 
going to I'm going to show you that next
if<00:04:30.949> you<00:04:31.430> have<00:04:31.610> trouble<00:04:32.150> pulling<00:04:32.449> out<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.870> ties

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
if you have trouble pulling out the ties

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.460 
if you have trouble pulling out the ties
just<00:04:33.590> cheat<00:04:34.520> like<00:04:34.729> I<00:04:34.940> do<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.449> put<00:04:36.020> your<00:04:36.199> hand

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
just cheat like I do and put your hand

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.089 
just cheat like I do and put your hand
inside<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.310> just<00:04:37.880> guide<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.360> ties<00:04:38.599> out<00:04:39.099> with

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
inside and just guide the ties out with

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.040 
inside and just guide the ties out with
your<00:04:40.250> hands<00:04:40.580> from<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.180> inside<00:04:41.270> out<00:04:41.750> it<00:04:41.930> makes

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
your hands from the inside out it makes

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.170 
your hands from the inside out it makes
it<00:04:42.199> a<00:04:42.259> lot<00:04:42.380> easier<00:04:42.440> that's<00:04:43.220> probably<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.819> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
it a lot easier that's probably the the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.460 
it a lot easier that's probably the the
trickiest<00:04:44.569> part<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.930> this<00:04:45.020> whole<00:04:45.229> thing<00:04:45.259> is

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
trickiest part of this whole thing is

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.050 
trickiest part of this whole thing is
just<00:04:45.680> getting<00:04:46.099> those<00:04:46.220> ties<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.669> come<00:04:46.819> out<00:04:46.910> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
just getting those ties to come out the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.439 
just getting those ties to come out the
holes<00:04:47.270> now<00:04:48.169> to<00:04:48.259> finish<00:04:48.680> this<00:04:48.889> off<00:04:49.389> this<00:04:50.389> is

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
holes now to finish this off this is

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.870 
holes now to finish this off this is
another<00:04:51.199> really<00:04:51.620> easy<00:04:51.800> way<00:04:52.039> to<00:04:52.099> do<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.340> there's

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
another really easy way to do it there's

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.460 
another really easy way to do it there's
a<00:04:52.970> there's<00:04:53.389> a<00:04:53.479> lot<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.750> ways<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.900> could<00:04:54.229> do<00:04:54.440> it

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
a there's a lot of ways you could do it

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.339 
a there's a lot of ways you could do it
but<00:04:55.220> here's<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.639> way<00:04:55.759> that<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.000> chose<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.720> I

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
but here's the way that I chose is I

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.740 
but here's the way that I chose is I
just<00:04:57.889> I<00:04:59.139> it's<00:05:00.139> kind<00:05:00.319> of<00:05:00.470> like<00:05:00.680> an<00:05:00.860> envelope<00:05:01.310> I

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
just I it's kind of like an envelope I

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.570 
just I it's kind of like an envelope I
just<00:05:02.750> folded<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.259> top<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.919> fabric<00:05:04.160> over

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
just folded the top of the fabric over

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.060 
just folded the top of the fabric over
the<00:05:05.270> cushion<00:05:06.699> and<00:05:08.320> then<00:05:09.320> I'm<00:05:09.590> going<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.800> fold

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
the cushion and then I'm going to fold

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.520 
the cushion and then I'm going to fold
this<00:05:10.460> part<00:05:11.419> over<00:05:11.599> and<00:05:11.720> actually<00:05:12.259> what<00:05:12.380> you're

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
this part over and actually what you're

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.960 
this part over and actually what you're
doing<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:12.800> you're<00:05:12.919> just<00:05:12.949> making<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.490> big<00:05:13.639> fold

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
doing is you're just making a big fold

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.300 
doing is you're just making a big fold
in<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.240> fabric<00:05:14.419> so<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.349> you<00:05:15.770> don't<00:05:15.949> have<00:05:16.130> any

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
in the fabric so that you don't have any

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.499 
in the fabric so that you don't have any
raw<00:05:16.639> and<00:05:16.940> raw<00:05:17.630> edges<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.940> shake<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.270> kind

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
raw and raw edges and shake it and kind

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.649 
raw and raw edges and shake it and kind
of<00:05:20.570> pull<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.960> real<00:05:21.139> nice<00:05:21.349> and<00:05:21.409> then<00:05:22.659> typically

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
of pull it real nice and then typically

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.480 
of pull it real nice and then typically
I<00:05:23.690> would<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:25.310> should<00:05:25.580> pin<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:27.490> because

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
I would and you should pin it because

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.980 
I would and you should pin it because
when<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.729> get<00:05:28.819> to<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.060> machine<00:05:29.419> that's<00:05:29.659> a<00:05:29.780> lot

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
when you get to the machine that's a lot

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.749 
when you get to the machine that's a lot
easier<00:05:30.020> if<00:05:30.560> you<00:05:30.680> have<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:30.889> pinned<00:05:31.250> and<00:05:31.490> this

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
easier if you have a pinned and this

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.230 
easier if you have a pinned and this
indoor<00:05:32.060> outdoor<00:05:32.210> fabric<00:05:32.720> is<00:05:32.870> slippery<00:05:33.169> too<00:05:34.240> so

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
indoor outdoor fabric is slippery too so

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.820 
indoor outdoor fabric is slippery too so
just<00:05:35.479> pin<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.720> I'd<00:05:35.990> pin<00:05:36.229> it<00:05:36.349> in<00:05:36.440> a<00:05:36.470> few<00:05:36.680> more

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
just pin it I'd pin it in a few more

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.770 
just pin it I'd pin it in a few more
places<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.430> then<00:05:37.789> all<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.240> need<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.479> do<00:05:38.599> is

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
places and then all you need to do is

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.290 
places and then all you need to do is
just<00:05:39.080> stitch<00:05:39.440> close<00:05:39.889> to<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.130> edge<00:05:40.250> across<00:05:40.880> and

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
just stitch close to the edge across and

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.779 
just stitch close to the edge across and
let<00:05:41.840> me<00:05:41.960> show<00:05:42.139> you<00:05:42.199> how<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.130> finished<00:05:43.430> one
