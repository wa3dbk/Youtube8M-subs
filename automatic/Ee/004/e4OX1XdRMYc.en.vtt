00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.599
 Good day, dear friends 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.599
 my name is perpetuum or alexander and 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.860
 Today I propose to return to 65 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.289
 million years ago 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.170
 well, or at least ten years when in 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.269
 my childhood inalienable attribute 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.090
 happy existence were dinosaurs 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.030
 I remember what hours I spent looking 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.769
 different encyclopedia watching the transfer 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.239
 dinosaur walks which 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.600
 broadcast power t 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.089
 I also loved this program very much 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.570
 many times watched the movie Jurassic Park 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.100
 period is good that recently it 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.720
 converted to 3d and I could finally 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.549
 did watch in the cinema 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.589
 I had a lot of positive 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.049
 emotions well let's move on 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.799
 specifically to these dinosaurs and what they 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.170
 make 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.510
 until this version of the dinosaurs mod 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 can attack you which is very sad and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.210
 they only carry a decorative look you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500
 you can create your Jurassic Park 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 combat as he gallops as he gallops 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 angry he looks at me and he understand 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 that can't attack me 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.679
 but it's for the best we can create here 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.350
 such pens and settle these pens 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.420
 dinosaurs sorry that there are no my favorites 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.579
 velociraptor and allosaurus 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.469
 Unfortunately there is not here Well let 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.109
 go through the dinosaur we will see how 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.719
 their name is the biggest is baryonyx 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:36.450
 for some reason I don’t remember this 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.719
 back here is such a big hump I don’t 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.789
 I know she called on another to 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.340
 unfortunately it has green coloring and 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.619
 he looks very scary clearly what when 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.999
 the mod will get its latest version this 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.270
 dinosaur will dominate 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:54.509
 Then go more small dinosaur 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.490
 to chicken-like name these moose 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.430
 parks like so something like it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.830
 bird what's amazingly possible you 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 for though no he most likely starts me 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 I will give it because it is so red 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 tuft 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.080
 and this bag obviously produces poison 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.270
 although I may be confused for sure 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.020
 I 'll have to give further go to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.680
 the next 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.270
 drama sauer also looks like a bird 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.740
 maybe he will become a bird and he too 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.750
 there is a tuft but he doesn't have a bear 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.459
 which can produce poison and to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.740
 the last work 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.420
 this is probably the most innocuous he 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.940
 reminds me of velociraptor though 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.430
 velociraptor was a little taller here 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.489
 okay there is one more 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.030
 dinosaur flying his name is Dima RF 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.430
 addon 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.070
 he has very small sizes he 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.390
 immediately flies away he looks more like a bird 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.370
 you see, they fly away immediately and therefore not 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.959
 I can create a corral where they lived 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.870
 only if the cage and I don't want to keep 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.430
 their favorite dinosaurs on taking in 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.810
 the cage 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.940
 Generally using this mod you can 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.340
 diversify your life as usual 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.930
 minecraft create an incredible park 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.090
 entertainment in which will be live 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.520
 dinosaurs all forgotten you come 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.920
 will just fuck off cool you 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.459
 which you can give them 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.320
 In general, it's all dinosaurs do not attack but 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.060
 You can watch them as the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.760
 time with you was a perpetuum or 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.900
 Alexander Thank you very much for watching before 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.900
