00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:07.470
 and is that I forget 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 we are not going to listen to the war 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.480
 big map 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.480
 let's move on 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.910
 and good 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.680
 apparently you can be seeing by 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.110
 please give him why 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.770
 if you can not quote 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.040
 and I really like the series yes no 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.650
 comment 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:54.300
 they would like them to be 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:58.350
 then a series of photos 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 and well, a comment 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.809
 in the hour of adventure he told me that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.809
 could you do 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.180
 explain this 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.440
 a series of dinosaurs and we're not going to 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.250
 We are already 99, we are almost going to 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.140
 the 200 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 and well now let's start in 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.530
 korakuen 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.729
 because to see if we arrive 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.300
 I do not know what 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.300
 good 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.799
 workshops 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.130
 the process that we just arrived at the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 100 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.180
 and they look for the noia 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.180
 people 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.960
 and why not 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.960
 You can kill 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.680
 how 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.680
 to reset 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.380
 for this fall 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.120
 what I will say that did not reach 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.120
 get it right 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.060
 if it is okay 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.880
 one 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 A) Yes 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.970
 so I hope it's okay 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.160
 create faults had and we're done with 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.160
 a star I think now stepping 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.640
 and well I will try 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.480
 can you say try to get there 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.340
 to try to upload this type but I'm going to 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.690
 have to practice 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.860
 to practice before the hand 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.860
 try to do this 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.190
 well, these levels are also 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.670
 on the facebook I think this one too 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.670
 no no 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.730
 I think the previous episode predicted 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.019
 I do not 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.019
 Well, we have one more 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.460
 22 we will be 25 and we will do 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.460
 the golden egg 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.320
 general 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.320
 giant 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.879
 is 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.780
 this is going to come 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.920
 Yes now 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.080
 do not 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.790
 ah 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.790
 and we are left with the steps 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.639
 in fact these levels are easier 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:47.030
 about 24 stress stars of two 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.350
 explosive stone 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.350
 yes literally stone 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.340
 i 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.180
 but this 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:25.290
 they have 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:28.530
 and well, well before the football series 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.530
 juanma trias 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:40.910
 not possible the challenge will be to have all 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.210
 the possible threads to catch them and 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.810
 well let's make the goal of nec that 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.810
 here we have one 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.139
 the rest 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.039
 what is that 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.039
 let's keep going 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.410
 sometimes 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:11.110
 or not 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.460
 and well this we already had 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.460
 and I hope you liked it 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.680
 and that we will do on 6 the 7 3
