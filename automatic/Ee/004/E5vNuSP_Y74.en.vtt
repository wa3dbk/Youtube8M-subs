00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.280
 no 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.100
 I'm stupid but I 'm part of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.660
 collective disco under whom organize 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.940
 events to raise awareness 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 public to food waste so the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.969
 discussion that's actually 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.040
 organizing user-friendly events 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.630
 to raise awareness among the general public 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.890
 food waste we have an approach 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.460
 which is safer to put it forward 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.869
 the festive aspect 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.770
 so there is always music 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.239
 today we have fanfare the goal 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.700
 is that people come to participate 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.960
 collectively produce together a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.269
 meal which is then distributed 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.609
 free to people to people who have 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.750
 prepared for people who are passing the 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.129
 base of discussion it's really for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.129
 fight food waste story 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.929
 notice that there are many things 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 who were thrown 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.130
 be it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.690
 from the market gardener who will produce these 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.670
 fresh vegetables is not going to sell everything 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.700
 then supermarkets that are 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.620
 also and we also consumers 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.210
 be conducted also to throw so he 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.600
 there is no more fault than others we are 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 there is a little impact to everything and to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.640
 all the stages of the chain and this 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.590
 are the studies well between 30 and 50% of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.250
 fruits and vegetables are produced which 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 are discarded are not consumed by by 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 the population so that's the discussion 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.899
 the goal is really to raise awareness 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.690
 people at that we get the fruits and 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.640
 vegetables at supermarkets 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.270
 in the markets of things that would have 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 had to be thrown away 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.410
 we will position ourselves not in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.990
 competition from associations that make 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.890
 already work very well but there is still 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.979
 things that end up in the trash 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.290
 and we're really on this tax is 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.790
 so the focus of floppies is 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.530
 for the moment quite punctual we are 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 really about events 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 tracy down a day here we are 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.720
 for three hours but the goal is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.539
 really to have a more global impact 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.430
 already by making the general public aware of 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.830
 wasted food we distribute 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.630
 meals that are that are edible are 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.850
 even very good and when people 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.720
 learn that they are made with 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.080
 fruits and vegetables that should have been 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.909
 thrown 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.450
 we hope that and a little tilt that gets 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.459
 go home 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.810
 after that there is also some of the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.739
 collective that acts at the national level 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.870
 who has the opportunity to meet 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.970
 government people to bring 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.510
 a stone to the more global building that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.510
 concerns all
