00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
which is nice because it gives it some

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
which is nice because it gives it some
motion<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> gives<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.420> paintings<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
motion it kind of gives your paintings a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
motion it kind of gives your paintings a
little<00:01:10.890> bit<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.189> animated<00:01:11.610> instead<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> just

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
little bit more animated instead of just

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
little bit more animated instead of just
being<00:01:12.990> still<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.189> wanted<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> change

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
being still but if we wanted to change

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.149 
being still but if we wanted to change
the<00:01:14.850> Ken<00:01:15.090> Burns<00:01:15.240> effect<00:01:15.619> we<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.830> click<00:01:17.040> on

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the Ken Burns effect we just click on

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.899 
the Ken Burns effect we just click on
this<00:01:17.250> icon<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:20.490> opens<00:01:20.790> up

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this icon right here and that opens up

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.940 
this icon right here and that opens up
our<00:01:21.090> Ken<00:01:21.509> Burns<00:01:21.720> effect<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.799> can

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
our Ken Burns effect and we can

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.060 
our Ken Burns effect and we can
manipulate<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.840> green<00:01:25.409> box<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
manipulate it so this green box is the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
manipulate it so this green box is the
start<00:01:26.340> point<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:30.000> red<00:01:30.210> box<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.659> end

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
start point this that red box is the end

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.399 
start point this that red box is the end
point<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> stretch<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.320> we

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
point so we can stretch that out and we

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.660 
point so we can stretch that out and we
can<00:01:34.560> hit<00:01:34.680> done<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> check<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
can hit done and we can check it out so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.460 
can hit done and we can check it out so
with<00:01:41.850> photo<00:01:42.060> slideshows<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.110> pretty<00:01:43.320> good

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
with photo slideshows it's pretty good

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
with photo slideshows it's pretty good
to<00:01:43.649> add<00:01:43.770> transitions<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> best<00:01:45.720> one

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to add transitions I think the best one

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.109 
to add transitions I think the best one
you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.619> cross<00:01:46.920> dissolve<00:01:47.369> because<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
you can do is cross dissolve because you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.319 
you can do is cross dissolve because you
don't<00:01:48.270> want<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.750> too<00:01:49.520> flashy<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.060> want<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
don't want to get too flashy you want to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
don't want to get too flashy you want to
focus<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:51.990> art<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> pictures

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
focus on your art or just the pictures

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
focus on your art or just the pictures
themselves<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.570> let's<00:01:54.750> go<00:01:54.869> ahead<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.110> take<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
themselves so let's go ahead and take a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.880 
themselves so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:57.079> that<00:01:58.079> was<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.380> quick<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
look at that that was pretty quick and I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
look at that that was pretty quick and I
bet<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.430> probably<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> default<00:02:00.740> 0.4

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
bet you it's probably at the default 0.4

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.760 
bet you it's probably at the default 0.4
seconds<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.340> let's<00:02:02.369> add<00:02:03.439> let's<00:02:04.439> make<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
seconds so let's add let's make that a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.839 
seconds so let's add let's make that a
second<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:06.540> hit<00:02:06.659> done<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.459> let's<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
second and hit done so now let's take a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.280 
second and hit done so now let's take a

I said we can count we can go in and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
I said we can count we can go in and
edit<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.900> we<00:03:19.080> do<00:03:19.319> want<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.920> Ken<00:03:20.580> Burns<00:03:20.790> effect

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940

which<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.690> good<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.170> some<00:03:22.379> pictures<00:03:22.800> but<00:03:23.370> like

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
which is good for some pictures but like

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.400 
which is good for some pictures but like
sometimes<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.269> gonna<00:03:24.360> crop<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.230> if<00:03:25.290> we

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
sometimes it's gonna crop it so if we

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.030 
sometimes it's gonna crop it so if we
want<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.769> fit<00:03:27.050> we<00:03:28.050> just<00:03:28.080> double<00:03:28.590> click<00:03:28.800> and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
want it to fit we just double click and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.520 
want it to fit we just double click and
then<00:03:29.849> hit<00:03:30.030> fit<00:03:30.360> there's<00:03:31.110> gonna<00:03:31.230> be<00:03:31.380> no

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
then hit fit there's gonna be no

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.150 
then hit fit there's gonna be no
animation<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:33.470> that's<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.650> done<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:36.800> well<00:03:37.800> go

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
animation so that's it done and well go

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.620 
animation so that's it done and well go
ahead<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.370> change<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.269> because

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
ahead and change this one because

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.660 
ahead and change this one because
sometimes<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.290> Ken<00:03:40.830> Burns<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.250> pretty<00:03:41.459> cool

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
sometimes the Ken Burns is pretty cool

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.030 
sometimes the Ken Burns is pretty cool
but<00:03:42.629> you're<00:03:43.080> gonna<00:03:43.170> miss<00:03:43.440> out<00:03:43.650> on<00:03:43.680> some<00:03:44.010> of

but you're gonna miss out on some of

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.940 
but you're gonna miss out on some of
your<00:03:44.690> art<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:46.049> might<00:03:46.260> work<00:03:46.410> better<00:03:46.650> if<00:03:46.830> you're

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
your art it might work better if you're

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.979 
your art it might work better if you're
doing<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.370> for<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.610> photo<00:03:47.880> slideshow<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:48.930> your

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.410 
doing it for a photo slideshow for your
family<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:50.370> since<00:03:50.670> we're<00:03:50.819> gonna<00:03:50.910> do<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.239> for

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
family but since we're gonna do it for

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.080 
family but since we're gonna do it for
an<00:03:51.510> art<00:03:51.690> project<00:03:51.980> let's<00:03:52.980> go<00:03:53.130> ahead<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.700> fit

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
most of our now for the clouds I think

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.180 
most of our now for the clouds I think
this<00:03:57.630> one<00:03:57.780> would<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:58.110> pretty<00:03:58.560> cool<00:03:58.799> with<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.010> Ken

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
this one would be pretty cool with a Ken

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.250 
this one would be pretty cool with a Ken
Burns<00:03:59.220> effect<00:03:59.640> because<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.239> gonna<00:04:00.390> almost

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
