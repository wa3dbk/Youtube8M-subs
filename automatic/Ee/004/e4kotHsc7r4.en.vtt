00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.120
 although it did not seem like the right moment 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:06.339
 to advance new consoles by price 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.950
 more than anything are and still eddie allegories 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.140
 with the sales of ps 4 that follows the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.570
 party only takes white and here it starts 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.070
 your daily picks today March 5, 2014 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.070
 almost spring 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.520
 It is already here although first they have 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
 tested those that were targeted at the 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.470
 beta xbox one is updated and we receive 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.210
 some more than remarkable changes not only 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.730
 for tight and fall to work 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 better but in usual use it's over 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.650
 that of getting lost in the menus until 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.360
 enter a chat worth perhaps those 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.340
 for that not, but if we do not care what 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 do with kinect that they do not see you 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 the list of changes is long and the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.580
 you have explained on the web in ign 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 of course, but good for 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.780
 you have an idea there are to all 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 levels from daily modifications of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 the servers in the cloud up 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.350
 extended compatibility with dolby 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.660
 digital this next to the new one to do 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.460
 streaming on tv tweets that almost 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.330
 loses the release of tight end for 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.950
 the hairs the stock problems have not 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.440
 stopped to sonny so that the border passes 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.960
 6 million weight sold 4 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.370
 besides japan has received the machine with 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 very good results in the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.050
 stores something that after getting lost 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 2013 is hopeful for this 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.680
 new generation in terms of data 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.590
 there is one that the intent should 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.390
 worry you in just three months 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.090
 have exceeded wii sales during 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.770
 the 15 that has been available this with 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.619
 very few games on the market and one 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.789
 direct competitor xbox one the only 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.979
 data that has paid a bit of euphoria 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.649
 are the sales that go are sado fold 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.959
 for ps 4 that are inferior to what 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.640
 expected although this should not worry 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.250
 sonny since the rate of games per 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 console has gone up to 2 with some 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.229
 titles this we have seen many times 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.569
 since the times of the spectrum a game 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.939
 to make xbox one games already 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.530
 it has and it's called projects park although 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.380
 moment is in the beta phase for 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.090
 console and windows 8.1 unlike 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.039
 other current initiatives with which 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.679
 is compared as 'littlebigplanet' or 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.869
 even minecraft project spark is 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.640
 something more freedom besides moment 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.879
 it's the simplest and simplest way 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.530
 quick to use the engine and unity3d because 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.900
 is what moves all of our 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.849
 creations within the game in the months 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.280
 that until the closed beta phase they have 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.110
 created many experiences what more 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 highlights are the game invitations 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.209
 classics or known from tetris or 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.190
 arkanoid up to precisely a minecraft 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.200
 in all 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.450
 let's say it promises although it will have to be seen 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.510
 if the union of mobile tablets triumphs 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.870
 traditional pc and xbox one and in what 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.000
 platform do you think they have more options 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.890
 with 'infamous' second are for ps 4 and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.750
 tight and fall in xbox one seems that 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.730
 finally we see flesh in the war of 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.560
 consoles because it's very good that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.910
 sell machines but if there are no games 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.130
 to test us we have 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.560
 cheaper solutions to see the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.570
 tele the case of tight and fall is also 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.220
 somewhat special single on and kirk 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.840
 launch software it seemed that the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.300
 microsoft was going to have complicated these 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.770
 months have sold but the chaos prior to 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.260
 launch has benefited the 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.630
 competition why microsoft needs to 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.570
 titan fold as much as electronic 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.490
 accurate of the xbox muscle at least in 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.560
 the marketing ground how much there will be 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.840
 cost to the campaign at the moment we have 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.730
 a television ad that is online 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.230
 with other console mix the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.510
 reality with the trend games 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.370
 although it surprises us a lot but if 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.020
 we want to see tight and fall is better than 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.020
 let's choose the launch trailer 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.370
 there you can see images of the game and 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.800
 what appear to be campaign videos 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.430
 but it was not going to be just a multiplayer 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.319
 competitive 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.010
 let's see if we talked to each other soon that only 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.060
 there's a week left for the launch 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.189
 point and followed that up to now 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.140
 come your daily fix today remember that 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.480
