00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
later so the first thing we're going to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.679 
later so the first thing we're going to
do<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.530> run<00:01:04.949> over<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.790> press<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> switch

do is run over here and press the switch

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.590 
do is run over here and press the switch
this<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.110> unlock<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> door<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.189> Attic

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
this is actually part of the last puzzle

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.500 
this is actually part of the last puzzle
will<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.130> solving<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:11.820> since<00:01:12.090> we're<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.450> we

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
will be solving but since we're here we

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.120 
will be solving but since we're here we
might<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.780> well<00:01:12.900> mock<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> since<00:01:13.740> we're<00:01:13.979> going

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
might as well mock it since we're going

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:23.330 
might as well mock it since we're going
to<00:01:14.189> need<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.460> later<00:01:21.979> first<00:01:22.979> thing<00:01:23.130> we're<00:01:23.250> going

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to need it later first thing we're going

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
to need it later first thing we're going
to<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.939> through<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.390> gym<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.380> gym<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to do is go through the gym the gym is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.840 
to do is go through the gym the gym is
great<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.070> haven't<00:01:26.310> played<00:01:26.460> tomb<00:01:26.670> raider

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
great if you haven't played tomb raider

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
great if you haven't played tomb raider
before<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> takes<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.930> through<00:01:28.200> all

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
before because it takes you through all

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
before because it takes you through all
of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> controls<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> game

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
of the controls and just how the game

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.330 
of the controls and just how the game
works<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.290> there's<00:01:31.650> nothing<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> be

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
works but there's nothing really to be

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.280 
works but there's nothing really to be
gained<00:01:32.610> from<00:01:32.790> its<00:01:33.000> secret<00:01:33.360> wise<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.020> we're

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
gained from its secret wise so we're

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.359 
gained from its secret wise so we're
just<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.619> skip<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.220> same

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
just going to skip it for now the same

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.859 
just going to skip it for now the same
with<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> pool<00:01:41.820> once<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.240> complete<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> gym

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
with the pool once you complete the gym

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
with the pool once you complete the gym
she'll<00:01:43.200> teach<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.680> some<00:01:43.890> moves<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> pool

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
she'll teach you some moves in the pool

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
she'll teach you some moves in the pool
but<00:01:44.850> we'll<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.020> skip<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:46.530> what

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
but we'll just skip that for now what

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.889 
but we'll just skip that for now what
we're<00:01:47.009> concerned<00:01:47.369> about<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.270> switch<00:01:48.630> on

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
we're concerned about is the switch on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.870 
we're concerned about is the switch on
the<00:01:48.930> back<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> diving<00:01:49.740> board<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:53.340> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the back of the diving board here and it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.580 
the back of the diving board here and it
opens<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.360> door<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> main<00:01:55.049> hall<00:01:55.320> there

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
opens that door in the main hall there

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
opens that door in the main hall there
it's<00:01:56.310> not<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> time<00:01:56.850> switch<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.509> don't<00:01:57.659> have

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it's not a time switch so we don't have

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's not a time switch so we don't have
to<00:01:57.840> worry<00:01:57.990> about<00:01:58.110> getting<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.649> fast<00:01:59.030> do<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to worry about getting there fast do a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.319 
to worry about getting there fast do a
swan<00:02:00.360> dive<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> swan<00:02:02.939> dive<00:02:02.969> by

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
swan dive you can do a swan dive by

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.990 
swan dive you can do a swan dive by
holding<00:02:03.630> walk<00:02:03.869> forward<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.619> jump<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.820> so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
holding walk forward and jump just so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:24.710 
holding walk forward and jump just so
you<00:02:06.119> know

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140 

all<00:02:25.720> right<00:02:25.930> now<00:02:26.049> once<00:02:26.260> we<00:02:26.409> pull<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.739> lever<00:02:27.150> for

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
all right now once we pull the lever for

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.500 
all right now once we pull the lever for
this<00:02:28.360> switch<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.650> timed<00:02:29.950> event<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:31.360> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
this switch it is a timed event so you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.360 
this switch it is a timed event so you
have<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.810> move<00:02:31.930> very<00:02:31.989> quickly<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.010> as<00:02:33.129> soon<00:02:33.250> as

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
have to move very quickly so as soon as

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.080 
have to move very quickly so as soon as
you<00:02:33.489> pull<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.849> you<00:02:34.599> want<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.840> do<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:34.989> roll<00:02:35.290> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
you pull it you want to do a roll and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.819 
you pull it you want to do a roll and
