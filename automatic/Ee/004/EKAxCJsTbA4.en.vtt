00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.250 
about three months ago I kind of laughed
it<00:03:03.470> off<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:05.510> know<00:03:05.630> when<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.840> said<00:03:06.140> and

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
it off but you know when I said and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.310 
it off but you know when I said and
think<00:03:06.440> about<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:08.030> was<00:03:08.870> probably<00:03:09.020> one<00:03:09.260> of

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
think about it it was probably one of

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.990 
think about it it was probably one of
the<00:03:09.410> right<00:03:09.560> right<00:03:09.890> decisions<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.940> be

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
the right right decisions to do is to be

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.460 
the right right decisions to do is to be
able<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.270> get<00:03:11.390> an<00:03:11.510> offensive<00:03:11.840> offensive

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
able to get an offensive offensive

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.430 
able to get an offensive offensive
lineman<00:03:13.370> but<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.239> think<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.720> position<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.320> we

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
lineman but I think the position that we

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.290 
lineman but I think the position that we
were<00:03:15.560> placed<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.250> with<00:03:16.790> Leonard<00:03:17.120> Williams

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
were placed in with Leonard Williams

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.660 
were placed in with Leonard Williams
dropping<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.140> us<00:03:18.290> at<00:03:18.470> six<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.190> think<00:03:19.520> it<00:03:19.610> was

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
dropping to us at six I think it was

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.640 
dropping to us at six I think it was
something<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.209> had<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.660> take

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
something we had to take

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.800 
something we had to take
that's<00:03:21.769> what<00:03:21.920> Mike<00:03:22.129> McKay<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.670> did<00:03:22.909> what<00:03:23.780> he

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
that's what Mike McKay and did what he

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.569 
that's what Mike McKay and did what he
basically<00:03:24.079> did<00:03:24.500> was<00:03:24.680> he<00:03:24.980> took<00:03:25.159> the<00:03:25.310> best

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
basically did was he took the best

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.899 
basically did was he took the best
player<00:03:25.879> in<00:03:25.909> the<00:03:26.090> draft<00:03:26.959> available<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.799> him<00:03:27.950> you
