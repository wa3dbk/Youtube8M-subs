00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
did I say circus or circuit okay

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.940 
did I say circus or circuit okay
that's<00:01:38.780> because<00:01:38.929> it's<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.470> clown<00:01:39.649> act

what you got here is the power windows
we<00:02:17.760> can't<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.150> that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
we can't do that

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.470 
we can't do that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
can't do that all right

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.750 
can't do that all right
we<00:02:23.340> even<00:02:23.640> got<00:02:23.880> okay<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.930> knock<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:25.830> off<00:02:28.760> we

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
we even got okay to knock it all off we

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.890 
we even got okay to knock it all off we
got<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> power<00:02:30.240> trunk

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
got the power trunk

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
we can't hook that up so what we have to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.230 
we can't hook that up so what we have to
do<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:34.200> make<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.440> right<00:02:34.830> okay<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.820> if<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.030> come

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
over here what we got to do is we

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.090 
over here what we got to do is we
actually<00:02:38.790> got<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.420> add<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.930> junction<00:02:40.590> box<00:02:40.800> to

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
actually got to add a junction box to

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.250 
actually got to add a junction box to
this<00:02:41.220> vehicle<00:02:41.670> okay<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> waterproof

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
this vehicle okay this is a waterproof

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.120 
this vehicle okay this is a waterproof
setup<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.520> encased<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.600> plastic<00:02:46.560> resin<00:02:47.010> on

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
setup it's encased with plastic resin on

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.870 
setup it's encased with plastic resin on
the<00:02:47.160> back<00:02:48.140> okay<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.320> what<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.340> got<00:02:50.489> here<00:02:50.700> let

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the back okay and what we got here let

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.280 
the back okay and what we got here let
me<00:02:50.970> take<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.180> off<00:02:51.360> all<00:02:51.959> right

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
me take that off all right

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.830 
me take that off all right
we<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.860> got<00:02:53.300> let's<00:02:54.300> see<00:02:54.420> one<00:02:54.630> two<00:02:54.660> three

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
we actually got let's see one two three

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.320 
we actually got let's see one two three
four<00:02:55.560> five<00:02:55.830> six<00:02:56.190> seven<00:02:56.520> we<00:02:56.820> got<00:02:56.940> eight<00:02:57.150> more

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
four five six seven we got eight more

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.199 
four five six seven we got eight more
circuits<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:57.959> got<00:02:58.140> three<00:02:59.000> circuits<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.150> are

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
circuits we got three circuits that are

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.750 
circuits we got three circuits that are
hot<00:03:00.450> all<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.690> time<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.440> got<00:03:01.760> five

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
hot all the time and then we got five

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.020 
hot all the time and then we got five
key<00:03:03.510> circuits<00:03:04.200> okay<00:03:04.830> now<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.190> runs<00:03:05.760> down

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
key circuits okay now that runs down

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.880 
key circuits okay now that runs down
through<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.510> relay<00:03:06.959> right<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:07.739> this

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
through this relay right here this

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.180 
through this relay right here this
breaker<00:03:08.220> switch<00:03:08.670> okay<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
breaker switch okay and this is the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.340 
breaker switch okay and this is the
solution<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:11.940> what<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.420> want<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.720> do<00:03:12.870> if

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
solution this is what you want to do if

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.130 
solution this is what you want to do if
you<00:03:13.830> run<00:03:14.040> into<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> problem<00:03:14.930> you're<00:03:15.930> going

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
you run into this problem you're going

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.170 
you run into this problem you're going
to<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.560> add<00:03:16.739> on<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.519> system<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:18.030> you

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
to have to add on to the system that you

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.740 
to have to add on to the system that you
got<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:19.680> little<00:03:19.830> bastard<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.489> not

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
got that little bastard there is not

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.090 
got that little bastard there is not
expect<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:21.959> ninety<00:03:22.290> eight<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.739> hook<00:03:22.920> that

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
expect that's ninety eight to hook that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.729 
expect that's ninety eight to hook that
up<00:03:23.160> it's<00:03:23.580> very<00:03:23.820> simple<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.570> got<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.230> got<00:03:25.440> two

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
up it's very simple you got you got two

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.979 
up it's very simple you got you got two
wires<00:03:26.040> okay<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.299> course<00:03:27.480> your<00:03:27.660> ground

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
wires okay and of course your ground

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.930 
wires okay and of course your ground
which<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.470> going<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.799> grounding<00:03:29.610> off<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
which is going to be grounding off to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.630 
which is going to be grounding off to
the<00:03:30.060> car<00:03:30.269> somewhere<00:03:30.830> okay<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.890> got<00:03:32.160> two<00:03:32.370> wires

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
the car somewhere okay you got two wires

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.310 
the car somewhere okay you got two wires
you<00:03:33.030> got<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.209> hot<00:03:33.450> wire<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.870> goes<00:03:33.959> straight<00:03:34.110> to

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
you got a hot wire that goes straight to

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.380 
you got a hot wire that goes straight to
directly<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.220> battery<00:03:35.459> which<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.180> down

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
directly to the battery which is down

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.759 
directly to the battery which is down
here<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.750> then<00:03:36.840> comes<00:03:37.080> around<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.620> not

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
here and then comes around that is not

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.160 
here and then comes around that is not
in<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.950> middle<00:03:38.160> miniature<00:03:38.489> battery<00:03:39.049> that's<00:03:40.049> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
in the middle miniature battery that's a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.910 
in the middle miniature battery that's a
breaker<00:03:40.470> I'll<00:03:41.190> show<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.970> okay<00:03:42.799> if<00:03:43.799> I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
breaker I'll show that to you okay if I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.030 
breaker I'll show that to you okay if I
can<00:03:44.040> get<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.280> off<00:03:45.440> okay<00:03:46.440> that's<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.769> breaker

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
can get it off okay that's a breaker

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.110 
can get it off okay that's a breaker
right<00:03:47.700> there<00:03:47.940> okay<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.260> don't<00:03:50.120> discharge

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
right there okay so you don't discharge

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.080 
right there okay so you don't discharge
any<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.420> your<00:03:51.510> energy<00:03:51.870> or<00:03:52.049> short<00:03:52.320> anything<00:03:52.530> out

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
and then you got the hot wire which we

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.600 
and then you got the hot wire which we
ran<00:03:55.560> back<00:03:55.890> through<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:57.440> firewall<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.739> here's

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
ran back through the firewall and here's

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.539 
ran back through the firewall and here's
the<00:03:59.760> wire<00:03:59.910> right<00:04:00.209> here<00:04:00.269> okay<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.769> we<00:04:01.920> hooked

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
the wire right here okay and we hooked

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.340 
the wire right here okay and we hooked
it<00:04:02.640> up<00:04:02.760> into<00:04:03.120> our<00:04:03.239> ignition<00:04:03.360> switch<00:04:03.930> which<00:04:04.320> is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
it up into our ignition switch which is

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.380 
it up into our ignition switch which is
right<00:04:04.620> there<00:04:04.920> okay<00:04:05.760> we<00:04:05.880> hooked<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.090> up<00:04:06.209> into

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
right there okay we hooked it up into

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.789 
right there okay we hooked it up into
the<00:04:06.600> ignition<00:04:06.959> switch<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.320> when<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.530> turn<00:04:07.650> the
