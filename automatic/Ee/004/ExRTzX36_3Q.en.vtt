video was to film an entire part because
of<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.799> modern<00:03:06.040> time<00:03:06.430> we<00:03:06.940> decided<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.510> make<00:03:07.659> it

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
of the modern time we decided to make it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.580 
of the modern time we decided to make it
a<00:03:07.840> full-length<00:03:08.230> web<00:03:08.560> video<00:03:08.829> which<00:03:09.579> I<00:03:09.730> feel<00:03:10.000> was

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
a full-length web video which I feel was

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.970 
a full-length web video which I feel was
was<00:03:11.590> necessary<00:03:12.220> for<00:03:12.670> today's<00:03:13.139> crowd<00:03:14.139> and<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
was necessary for today's crowd and the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.099 
was necessary for today's crowd and the
way<00:03:15.129> that<00:03:15.310> we<00:03:15.400> do<00:03:15.519> things<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:16.629> I<00:03:16.689> think<00:03:16.780> Lee

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
way that we do things but I think Lee

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.110 
way that we do things but I think Lee
