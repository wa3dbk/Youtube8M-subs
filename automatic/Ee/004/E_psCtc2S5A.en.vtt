vinyl<00:00:46.300> corner<00:00:46.719> bead<00:00:46.899> I've<00:00:47.859> already

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
vinyl corner bead I've already

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.149 
vinyl corner bead I've already
determined<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:49.269> angle<00:00:49.719> of<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:49.989> cut<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:50.890> need<00:00:51.070> to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
determined the angle of a cut I need to

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.189 
determined the angle of a cut I need to
make<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.489> fit<00:00:51.699> this<00:00:51.850> off-angle<00:00:52.420> corner<00:00:52.899> up<00:00:53.019> on

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
make the fit this off-angle corner up on

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.630 
make the fit this off-angle corner up on
there<00:00:53.409> and<00:00:55.499> what<00:00:56.499> I'm<00:00:56.620> using<00:00:56.859> is<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.339> final

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
there and what I'm using is the final

there and what I'm using is the final
corner<00:00:57.819> beat<00:00:58.030> as<00:00:58.179> I<00:00:58.359> mentioned<00:00:58.870> but<00:00:59.409> see<00:00:59.589> what

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
corner beat as I mentioned but see what

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.829 
corner beat as I mentioned but see what
I'm<00:00:59.859> using<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.249> bullnose<00:01:00.789> corner<00:01:01.239> bead<00:01:01.390> you

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
I'm using is a bullnose corner bead you

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.880 
I'm using is a bullnose corner bead you
can't<00:01:02.109> just<00:01:02.379> take<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:05.229> can't<00:01:05.409> just<00:01:05.590> take<00:01:05.770> this

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
can't just take you can't just take this

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.580 
can't just take you can't just take this
and<00:01:06.070> try<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.220> balance<00:01:06.550> it<00:01:06.880> on<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.150> saw<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:08.409> get

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
and try to balance it on the saw to get

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.639 
and try to balance it on the saw to get
it<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.860> nice<00:01:09.070> cut<00:01:09.370> it<00:01:09.520> has<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.850> actually<00:01:10.030> be

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
it a nice cut it has to actually be

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.730 
it a nice cut it has to actually be
supported<00:01:11.649> so<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:14.049> I've<00:01:14.170> made<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.710> a

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
supported so what I've made is is a

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.760 
supported so what I've made is is a
piece<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.189> 2x4<00:01:15.719> and<00:01:16.719> we've<00:01:16.899> routed<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.619> edge

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
piece of 2x4 and we've routed the edge

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.130 
piece of 2x4 and we've routed the edge
to<00:01:18.460> accommodate<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.090> radius<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.689> this<00:01:19.840> bead

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
to accommodate the radius of this bead

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.770 
to accommodate the radius of this bead
and<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:21.430> just<00:01:21.700> need<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.969> make<00:01:22.119> an<00:01:22.270> adjustment<00:01:22.360> I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
and I just need to make an adjustment I

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.810 
and I just need to make an adjustment I
know<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.170> this<00:01:23.320> particular<00:01:23.649> cut<00:01:24.159> here<00:01:24.670> is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
know that this particular cut here is

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.100 
know that this particular cut here is
going<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.780> be<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.430> 29<00:01:27.430> degree<00:01:30.420> cut<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:31.960> I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
going to be a 29 degree cut so I just I

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.569 
going to be a 29 degree cut so I just I
just<00:01:32.439> adjust<00:01:32.829> it<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.869> 29<00:01:35.289> degrees<00:01:35.560> lock<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.490> in

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
just adjust it the 29 degrees lock it in

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.740 
just adjust it the 29 degrees lock it in
place<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:39.130> another<00:01:39.369> nice<00:01:39.640> feature<00:01:39.939> is<00:01:40.329> I<00:01:40.359> had

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
place and another nice feature is I had

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.830 
place and another nice feature is I had
to<00:01:40.899> really<00:01:41.079> have<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.530> laser<00:01:42.039> light<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
to really have the laser light that

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.139 
to really have the laser light that
shines<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.500> helps<00:01:44.920> me<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.070> line<00:01:45.369> up<00:01:45.579> any<00:01:45.850> any

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
shines it helps me to line up any any

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.870 
shines it helps me to line up any any
cuts<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:46.689> need<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:47.020> make<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.950> vinyl<00:01:48.549> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
cuts I need to make this is vinyl and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.690 
cuts I need to make this is vinyl and
this<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.539> pretty<00:01:49.750> coarse<00:01:50.109> tooth<00:01:50.530> saw<00:01:51.039> so

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
this is a pretty coarse tooth saw so

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.190 
this is a pretty coarse tooth saw so
what<00:01:51.850> I've<00:01:51.969> done<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.210> I've<00:01:52.479> actually<00:01:52.630> taken

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
what I've done is I've actually taken

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.319 
what I've done is I've actually taken
the<00:01:53.289> blade<00:01:53.500> out<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.009> turn<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.789> backwards<00:01:55.030> so

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
the blade out and turn it backwards so

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.910 
the blade out and turn it backwards so
it's<00:01:55.509> actually<00:01:55.840> spinning<00:01:56.109> backwards<00:01:56.439> and

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
it's actually spinning backwards and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
it's actually spinning backwards and
that<00:01:57.340> really<00:01:57.719> helps<00:01:58.719> eliminate<00:01:59.429> chipping<00:02:00.429> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that really helps eliminate chipping and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.910 
that really helps eliminate chipping and
chattering<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.229> blade<00:02:02.469> as<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.649> goes

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
chattering of the blade as it goes

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.580 
chattering of the blade as it goes
through<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.310> bead<00:02:04.060> but<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.689> still<00:02:04.960> go<00:02:05.109> nice<00:02:05.320> and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
through the bead but I still go nice and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.020 
through the bead but I still go nice and
slow<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.799> don't<00:02:06.070> want<00:02:06.219> to<00:02:06.369> rush<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:06.999> through

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
slow I don't want to rush it through

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:17.410 
slow I don't want to rush it through
like<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.509> might<00:02:07.689> with<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:07.960> piece<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.320> wood

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.119 

just<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.510> little<00:02:18.749> bit<00:02:18.870> lost<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.290> was<00:02:19.499> a<00:02:19.680> little

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
just a little bit lost I was a little

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.339 
just a little bit lost I was a little
bit<00:02:20.219> more<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.749> this<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.079> where<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
bit more of it see this is where the

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.649 
bit more of it see this is where the
laser<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:23.010> comes<00:02:23.219> in<00:02:23.370> handy<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.819> can<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.299> know

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
laser really comes in handy I can I know

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.539 
laser really comes in handy I can I know
I<00:02:24.780> only<00:02:25.019> want<00:02:25.139> to<00:02:25.319> take<00:02:25.530> maybe<00:02:25.980> an<00:02:26.189> eighth<00:02:26.370> of

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
I only want to take maybe an eighth of

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.670 
I only want to take maybe an eighth of
an<00:02:26.700> inch<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:26.999> so<00:02:27.060> off<00:02:27.389> and<00:02:27.719> I<00:02:28.109> can<00:02:28.290> actually

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
an inch or so off and I can actually

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.349 
an inch or so off and I can actually
line<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:28.950> because<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.430> laser<00:02:29.609> marks<00:02:30.090> full

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
line up because the laser marks full

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.589 
line up because the laser marks full
size<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.469> cut<00:02:32.219> will<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:33.180> Bulldogs

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
size of the cut will be the Bulldogs

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.360 
size of the cut will be the Bulldogs
corner<00:02:33.989> BT<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.349> I'm<00:02:34.469> using<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.340> low<00:02:35.790> sprung

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
corner BT that I'm using is a low sprung

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.670 
corner BT that I'm using is a low sprung
3/4<00:02:38.370> bull<00:02:38.730> nose<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.510> actual<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:40.260> notches

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
3/4 bull nose the actual little notches

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.839 
3/4 bull nose the actual little notches
that<00:02:41.310> help<00:02:41.969> it<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:42.359> they<00:02:43.290> don't<00:02:43.530> go<00:02:44.099> into<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
that help it then they don't go into the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.149 
that help it then they don't go into the
finished<00:02:45.389> surface<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.650> beat<00:02:46.859> is<00:02:46.980> good

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
finished surface so this beat is good

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.089 
finished surface so this beat is good
for<00:02:47.340> these<00:02:47.459> large<00:02:47.730> radius<00:02:48.239> arches<00:02:48.889> but<00:02:49.889> it<00:02:49.980> is

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
for these large radius arches but it is

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.890 
for these large radius arches but it is
like<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.430> said<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.669> is<00:02:50.760> pre<00:02:51.030> cut<00:02:51.269> along<00:02:51.449> the<00:02:51.629> tabs

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
like I said it is pre cut along the tabs

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.229 
like I said it is pre cut along the tabs
along<00:02:52.199> the<00:02:52.439> edge<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.519> still<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.939> to<00:02:53.969> put

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
along the edge but I still like to put

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.119 
along the edge but I still like to put
spray<00:02:54.480> adhesive<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.319> help<00:02:55.500> hold<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:55.949> in

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
spray adhesive on to help hold this in

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.649 
spray adhesive on to help hold this in
place<00:02:56.159> it<00:02:56.519> really<00:02:56.699> makes<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.060> installation<00:02:57.239> a

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
place it really makes the installation a

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:05.869 
place it really makes the installation a
lot<00:02:57.810> easier<00:02:58.169> I<00:03:00.980> put<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> couple<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:04.639> coats<00:03:05.639> right

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
lot easier I put a couple of coats right

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:32.270 
lot easier I put a couple of coats right
on<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.319> drywall

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.580 

the<00:03:33.280> best<00:03:33.550> way<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.790> actually<00:03:34.570> attach<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.380> beat

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
the best way to actually attach a beat

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.580 
the best way to actually attach a beat
to<00:03:35.770> an<00:03:35.890> archway<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:37.420> install<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.080> bead<00:03:38.290> on

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
to an archway is to install the bead on

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.740 
to an archway is to install the bead on
the<00:03:38.710> arch<00:03:38.980> first<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:40.000> then<00:03:40.510> put<00:03:40.690> your

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
the arch first and then put your

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.270 
the arch first and then put your
verticals<00:03:41.200> fit<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.770> it<00:03:41.890> because<00:03:41.980> if<00:03:42.190> I

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
verticals fit up to it because if I

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.360 
verticals fit up to it because if I
tried<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.700> fit<00:03:42.910> this<00:03:43.120> sprung<00:03:44.080> arch<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.770> with

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
tried to fit this sprung arch in with

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.090 
tried to fit this sprung arch in with
both<00:03:45.550> verticals<00:03:46.090> already<00:03:46.480> on<00:03:46.720> it'd<00:03:47.560> be<00:03:47.800> really

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
both verticals already on it'd be really

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.250 
both verticals already on it'd be really
difficult<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.730> get<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.090> exact<00:03:49.630> tight<00:03:49.930> fit<00:03:50.230> so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
difficult to get that exact tight fit so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260 
difficult to get that exact tight fit so
I'm<00:03:50.470> gonna<00:03:50.560> install<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.910> fit<00:03:52.150> the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
I'm gonna install this that fit the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.480 
I'm gonna install this that fit the
verticals<00:03:52.720> up<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.320> one<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.430> just

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
verticals up to this one so I just

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.090 
verticals up to this one so I just
marked<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> bead<00:03:55.560> roughly<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> height<00:03:56.710> that<00:03:56.980> I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
marked a bead roughly the height that I

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.130 
marked a bead roughly the height that I
need<00:03:57.310> I've<00:03:57.730> hacked<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.270> actually<00:03:58.570> have<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> piece

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
need I've hacked I actually have a piece

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.990 
need I've hacked I actually have a piece
on<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.380> bottom<00:03:59.530> that<00:04:00.400> makes<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.820> transition

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
on the bottom that makes a transition

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.840 
on the bottom that makes a transition
from<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.840> bulldoze<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.590> square<00:04:03.040> corner<00:04:03.340> so

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
from the bulldoze to a square corner so

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.430 
from the bulldoze to a square corner so
it's<00:04:03.940> gonna<00:04:04.030> be<00:04:04.180> extra<00:04:04.450> long<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:05.260> I'm<00:04:05.320> gonna

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
it's gonna be extra long so I'm gonna

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.860 
it's gonna be extra long so I'm gonna
fit<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.740> mitre<00:04:05.980> first<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.760> my<00:04:07.210> final<00:04:07.660> cut

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
fit the mitre first and my final cut

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.820 
fit the mitre first and my final cut
will<00:04:08.020> be<00:04:08.050> two-lane<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:11.110> I'm<00:04:11.200> just<00:04:11.500> checking

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
will be two-lane and I'm just checking

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.190 
will be two-lane and I'm just checking
to<00:04:12.040> make<00:04:12.160> sure<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.640> my<00:04:12.850> like<00:04:13.540> cuts

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
to make sure that my like cuts

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.070 
to make sure that my like cuts
fit<00:04:14.440> together<00:04:14.830> well<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:16.180> they<00:04:16.390> do<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:16.870> now<00:04:16.959> I'm

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
fit together well and they do so now I'm

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.380 
fit together well and they do so now I'm
just<00:04:17.170> gonna<00:04:17.320> hold<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.709> in<00:04:17.859> place<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.519> mark

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
just gonna hold that in place and mark

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.820 
just gonna hold that in place and mark
my<00:04:19.630> length<00:04:19.870> on<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.170> bottom<00:04:20.500> where<00:04:20.620> I'm<00:04:20.709> gonna

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
my length on the bottom where I'm gonna

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:34.560 
my length on the bottom where I'm gonna
make<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.160> final<00:04:21.549> car<00:04:33.060> now<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.390> just

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
make the final car now this is just

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.840 
make the final car now this is just
gonna<00:04:34.660> be<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> 90-degree<00:04:35.890> spot<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.640> I'm<00:04:36.730> just

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
gonna be a 90-degree spot so I'm just

00:04:36.850 --> 00:05:05.439 
gonna be a 90-degree spot so I'm just
gonna<00:04:38.820> reset<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.330> mitre<00:04:40.570> saw
