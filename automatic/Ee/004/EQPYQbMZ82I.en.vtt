00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.039 
use my king B guitars relic Telecaster
probably<00:01:04.549> use<00:01:04.759> a<00:01:04.790> combination<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.840> both

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
probably use a combination of both

gonna mess around with this thing
probably<00:01:16.790> edit<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.509> together<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.259> can

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
probably edit this together so you can

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.460 
probably edit this together so you can
hear<00:01:18.740> each<00:01:18.950> different<00:01:19.400> individual<00:01:20.000> tone<00:01:20.470> from

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
hear each different individual tone from

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.090 
hear each different individual tone from
the<00:01:22.369> instructions<00:01:23.329> like<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:24.500> said<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.070> a

I'm<00:04:46.300> not<00:04:46.449> sure<00:04:46.629> what<00:04:46.780> they<00:04:46.930> mean<00:04:47.110> but<00:04:47.800> anyway

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
I'm not sure what they mean but anyway

00:04:48.129 --> 00:06:08.790 
I'm not sure what they mean but anyway
it's<00:04:48.430> great

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.410 

so<00:06:09.800> yeah<00:06:10.190> there<00:06:10.670> you<00:06:10.790> go<00:06:10.820> there's<00:06:11.120> a<00:06:11.180> bunch<00:06:11.360> of

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
so yeah there you go there's a bunch of

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.590 
so yeah there you go there's a bunch of
different<00:06:11.540> talents<00:06:12.020> from<00:06:12.170> one<00:06:12.290> little<00:06:12.560> box<00:06:13.600> it

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
different talents from one little box it

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.330 
different talents from one little box it
can<00:06:14.720> be<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:14.900> little<00:06:15.140> misleading<00:06:15.680> that<00:06:16.160> there's

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
can be a little misleading that there's

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.800 
can be a little misleading that there's
only<00:06:16.430> three<00:06:16.670> knobs<00:06:16.850> on<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.240> top<00:06:17.450> when<00:06:17.660> there's

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
only three knobs on the top when there's

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.480 
only three knobs on the top when there's
a<00:06:17.870> bunch<00:06:18.050> of<00:06:18.260> switches<00:06:18.410> on<00:06:18.710> the<00:06:18.740> inside<00:06:19.220> which

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
a bunch of switches on the inside which

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.880 
a bunch of switches on the inside which
I<00:06:19.640> generally<00:06:20.090> don't<00:06:20.210> like<00:06:20.500> but<00:06:21.500> now<00:06:21.650> that<00:06:21.830> I

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
I generally don't like but now that I

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.950 
I generally don't like but now that I
see<00:06:22.160> that<00:06:22.190> you<00:06:22.730> can<00:06:22.940> actually<00:06:23.150> open<00:06:23.510> up<00:06:23.900> the

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
see that you can actually open up the

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.420 
see that you can actually open up the
instruction<00:06:26.960> manual<00:06:27.530> and<00:06:27.740> learn<00:06:28.070> a<00:06:28.100> little

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
instruction manual and learn a little

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.800 
instruction manual and learn a little
bit<00:06:28.580> about<00:06:28.790> something<00:06:29.150> maybe<00:06:29.390> I'll<00:06:29.600> do<00:06:29.780> that

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
bit about something maybe I'll do that

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.650 
bit about something maybe I'll do that
in<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.110> future<00:06:30.320> I<00:06:31.330> doubt<00:06:32.330> it

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
in the future I doubt it

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.110 
in the future I doubt it
this<00:06:32.930> was<00:06:33.110> a<00:06:33.140> one-time<00:06:33.410> deal<00:06:34.130> anyway<00:06:34.850> King

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
this was a one-time deal anyway King
