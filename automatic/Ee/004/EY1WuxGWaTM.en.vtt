you can get three hits like right off

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.590 
you can get three hits like right off
the<00:01:48.670> bat<00:01:48.850> like<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:50.110> really<00:01:50.740> helps<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.600> lot

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
the bat like that it really helps a lot

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.870

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
way is that he makes and run away from

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.840 
way is that he makes and run away from
his<00:01:57.460> head<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:59.440> is<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.710> whole<00:02:00.070> charge<00:02:00.369> I<00:02:00.550> used

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
his head this is a whole charge I used

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.359 
his head this is a whole charge I used
to<00:02:00.940> try<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.180> dodge<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:03.009> kind<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
to try and dodge that and this kind of

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.460 
to try and dodge that and this kind of
circle<00:02:03.850> around<00:02:04.030> his<00:02:04.540> body<00:02:04.720> like<00:02:05.110> as<00:02:05.290> he's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
circle around his body like as he's

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.530 
circle around his body like as he's
charging<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.430> as<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.970> avoid<00:02:07.390> that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
charging you so you as you avoid that

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.660 
charging you so you as you avoid that
attack<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.950> hit<00:02:09.040> him<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> couple<00:02:09.429> more

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
attack and you hit him a couple more

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.720 
attack and you hit him a couple more
times<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.209> then<00:02:10.300> he's<00:02:10.420> done<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:11.350> yeah<00:02:11.830> if<00:02:12.550> it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
times and then he's done so yeah if it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.550 
times and then he's done so yeah if it
took<00:02:12.850> me<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.060> couple<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.450> tries<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.110> figured

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
took me a couple of tries but I figured

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.760 
took me a couple of tries but I figured
out<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.709> strategy<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:17.140> biggest<00:02:17.440> part<00:02:17.680> is

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
out a strategy and the biggest part is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.160 
out a strategy and the biggest part is
really<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.459> going<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.239> right<00:02:19.570> away<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
really just going in right away and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.199 
really just going in right away and
getting<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.950> lot<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.130> hits<00:02:21.310> right<00:02:21.640> away<00:02:21.850> that'll

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
getting a lot of hits right away that'll

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.290 
getting a lot of hits right away that'll
really<00:02:22.480> really<00:02:22.720> help<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:24.160> once<00:02:25.150> I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
really really help you and then once I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.120 
really really help you and then once I
did<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.110> kind<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.650> had<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.950> run

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
did that I just kind of had to run

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.160 
did that I just kind of had to run
around<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.459> avoid<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.420> next<00:02:28.840> attack

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
around and avoid that that next attack

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.590 
around and avoid that that next attack
