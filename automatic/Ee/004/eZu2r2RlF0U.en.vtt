might take a couple times so you know

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
might take a couple times so you know
practice<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:35.700> take<00:01:36.030> your

okay watch very closely because this

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.910 
okay watch very closely because this
part<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.680> very<00:01:40.759> very<00:01:41.759> very<00:01:42.659> important<00:01:43.110> just

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
look at that Titus ever they're never

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
look at that Titus ever they're never
gonna<00:02:00.390> fall<00:02:00.600> off<00:02:00.659> now<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> did<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
gonna fall off now because I did that

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
gonna fall off now because I did that
okay<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.179> one<00:02:03.329> ok<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.869> take<00:02:04.049> a
