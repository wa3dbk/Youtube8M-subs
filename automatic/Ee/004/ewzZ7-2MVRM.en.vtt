00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.149
 hello to all youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:12.499
 I'm going to review the mouse 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:14.839
 microsoft 1.1 to black with three buttons and 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.590
 well why not also the van gogh 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.890
 litus de ryser 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.509
 the speed 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.550
 a peculiarity of microsoft 1.1 is 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.380
 that the truth was very comfortable 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.359
 this will buy it so it's all 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.680
 perfectly new I'm using it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.040
 I'm trying 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.070
 comes with 400 cpi of wildlife and not what 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.830
 you will also need no driver because 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 it seemed right to me what it was 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.290
 I did do was overclocking 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 Portuguese hebe to take the mouse to 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.700
 500 exercises 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.690
 here in the response time will be 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.640
 better I did not want to lift it because 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.050
 you could get to burn or have a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 inconvenience with 500 appears is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.260
 perfect 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 the first impression when I opened it was 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.300
 the big one is a little bigger than 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 who sounds as big as 3.0 but 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.470
 it has a pretty comfortable way my extra 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.100
 and well I did it more than anything for fps 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.590
 1.6 and now 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.380
 as it is very common 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.210
 the buttons are quite soft on 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.520
 only one problem that he lived in the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.189
 mouse is the wheel that is very soft and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.719
 maybe sometimes high but if it breaks if 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.700
 I was looking on youtube and there are several 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.700
 videos of how to fix that problem 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.960
 good bread 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.200
 the scorer 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.470
 very soft very soft with a very 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.650
 good 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.110
 the non-slip bottom you have the rays 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.260
 brand delegate 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.620
 very fast the glide or the plans 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.150
 of the mouse are very comfortable moves very 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.190
 easy 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.470
 and well nothing else will be more than anything 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.360
 show and recommend if the clear ones that yes 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.610
 it's an old school 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.210
 the true 1.1 I could not get 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.880
 original microsoft with box all this 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.150
 so he told me with respect because 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 I had someone upload 2 but today I had a 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.850
 hot because I was throwing a lazio and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.730
 this one to turn and the mouse dizzy 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.380
 let's say 'marÃ­a looks at it and puts a circle 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.820
 it's going up and down I have 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.800
 said that that problem was with peace of 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.930
 color I had in the fan but 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.300
 I honestly did not like the max 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.420
 however this is a bitch mouse 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420
 mother 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.380
 well, it also takes away the acceleration 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.170
 mouse with what to put the half that 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.410
 Call marc yes because for windows 7 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.030
 windows 8 that you have to modify some 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.150
 records now very easy to go out to 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.099
 mena guides how to use it on youtube 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.989
 Well I hope you liked it and 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.579
 good to be convinced to buy the 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.620
 theme because I really recommend them 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.500
 the cable he made is a bit hard but 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.049
 it's getting used to soften it 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.060
 little they leave it stretched out like that at night and 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.359
 Well , it's going to go a little bit 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.109
 softening and it is becoming more like 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.989
 get used to tea time very 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.859
 fast good nothing more than that many 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.859
