you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.750> kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> noscope<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.740> weapon

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you can kind of noscope with this weapon

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
you can kind of noscope with this weapon
which<00:01:26.400> isn't<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.820> too<00:01:26.939> important<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.540> don't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
which isn't really too important I don't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.149 
which isn't really too important I don't
really<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.080> anyone's<00:01:28.590> ridding<00:01:28.860> me<00:01:28.920> trying

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
really think anyone's ridding me trying

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.170 
really think anyone's ridding me trying
to<00:01:29.189> noscope<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.820> weapon<00:01:29.970> it's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to noscope with this weapon it's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.100 
to noscope with this weapon it's
definitely<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.509> something<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> should<00:01:30.990> go

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
definitely not something you should go

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.780 
definitely not something you should go
for<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.979> definitely<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> set

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
for so it's definitely not really a set

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
for so it's definitely not really a set
there's<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.090> beneficial<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> last<00:01:34.290> set

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
there's that beneficial and the last set

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.539 
there's that beneficial and the last set
there's<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:34.890> affected<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
there's actually affected is the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.580 
there's actually affected is the
mobility<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.810> -<00:01:37.200> once

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
mobility and there's actually - once

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
mobility and there's actually - once
that<00:01:37.860> means<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.220> aim<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.549> sights<00:01:38.790> give<00:01:38.939> me<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
that means your aim now sights give me a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
that means your aim now sights give me a
little<00:01:39.299> bit<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.540> slower<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.439> not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
little bit of slower it's really not

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
little bit of slower it's really not
that<00:01:40.560> noticeable<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> actual<00:01:41.729> aim

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that noticeable but the actual aim

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
that noticeable but the actual aim
outside<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> tiny<00:01:42.960> bit<00:01:43.170> slower<00:01:43.290> that's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
outside will be a tiny bit slower that's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
outside will be a tiny bit slower that's
what<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> mobility<00:01:44.310> stud<00:01:44.520> does<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.090> case<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
what the mobility stud does in case you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
what the mobility stud does in case you
don't<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> very<00:01:46.979> very<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:47.549> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
don't know but it's a very very kind of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
don't know but it's a very very kind of
average<00:01:48.090> variant<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:48.930> think

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
average variant I really don't think

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
average variant I really don't think
it's<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.380> deserving<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> legendary<00:01:50.490> tag

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's that deserving of the legendary tag

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
it's that deserving of the legendary tag
of<00:01:50.820> course<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.119> legend<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.630> cool<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
of course as legend so it's cool but the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810 
of course as legend so it's cool but the
stats<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:53.159> too<00:01:53.310> impressive<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
stats are really not too impressive I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.649 
stats are really not too impressive I
think<00:01:53.850> some<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> other<00:01:54.360> grants<00:01:54.570> are

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
think some of the other grants are

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.090 
think some of the other grants are
actually<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.350> better<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.860> honest

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
actually a little bit better to honest

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.649 
actually a little bit better to honest
but<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.520> don't<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.270> deserves<00:01:57.390> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
but I don't know if it deserves a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.969 
but I don't know if it deserves a
legendary<00:01:58.020> tag<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.469> definitely<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
legendary tag it's definitely not one of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.410 
legendary tag it's definitely not one of
the<00:01:59.100> best<00:01:59.219> weapons<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.880> in<00:01:59.969> terms<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.210> actual

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the best weapons but in terms of actual

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
the best weapons but in terms of actual
sniper<00:02:00.750> rifle<00:02:01.049> how<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.290> functions<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.829> can

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
sniper rifle how it functions you can

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.530 
sniper rifle how it functions you can
see<00:02:02.100> right<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.549> actually<00:02:02.969> pretty<00:02:03.149> decent

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
see right here is actually pretty decent

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.940 
see right here is actually pretty decent
like<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.990> thought<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> two

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
like I thought it would be like a two

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.560 
like I thought it would be like a two
hit<00:02:05.100> kill<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> dragon<00:02:06.060> off<00:02:06.149> used<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> be

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
hit kill like the dragon off used to be

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
hit kill like the dragon off used to be
in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> SVU<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.290> older<00:02:07.619> 4gu<00:02:07.950> games<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.520> not

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
in the SVU and older 4gu games it's not

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.979 
in the SVU and older 4gu games it's not
being<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.940> very<00:02:09.090> weak<00:02:09.390> sniper<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:09.899> this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
being a very weak sniper but this

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.600 
being a very weak sniper but this
definitely<00:02:10.229> papal<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.830> ever<00:02:11.009> been<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.430> cod

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
definitely papal it's ever been in a cod

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.220 
definitely papal it's ever been in a cod
game<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.510> hit<00:02:12.690> -<00:02:12.810> pretty<00:02:13.080> much

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
game and it's a one hit - pretty much

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.700 
game and it's a one hit - pretty much
anyway

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
anyway

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.100 
anyway
in<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.040> body<00:02:14.280> like<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.790> noticed<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.480> does<00:02:15.780> quite

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
in the body like I noticed it does quite

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
in the body like I noticed it does quite
easily<00:02:16.320> get<00:02:16.740> consistent<00:02:17.400> one-hit<00:02:17.820> kills

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
easily get consistent one-hit kills

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.970 
easily get consistent one-hit kills
except<00:02:18.690> if<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> hit<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.470> edges<00:02:19.860> of

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
except if you hit it like the edges of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.290 
except if you hit it like the edges of
the<00:02:20.070> limits<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.610> hands<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> feet

the limits like the hands and the feet

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.060 
the limits like the hands and the feet

around that error if you hit like the

didn't<00:02:29.850> happen<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.240> often<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.690> most<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
didn't happen that often but most of the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.780 
didn't happen that often but most of the
time<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.680> getting<00:02:31.890> one-hit<00:02:32.430> kills<00:02:32.610> which

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
time I was getting one-hit kills which

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.580 
time I was getting one-hit kills which
is<00:02:32.940> pretty<00:02:33.090> cool<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.480> once<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.320> past

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
is pretty cool and once you get past

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.290 
is pretty cool and once you get past
that<00:02:34.710> first<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.280> kick<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.670> recall<00:02:36.000> which<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
that first like kick of recall which is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.150 
that first like kick of recall which is
pretty<00:02:36.660> insane<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.110> takes<00:02:37.260> really<00:02:37.620> high<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
pretty insane it takes really high it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.340 
pretty insane it takes really high it
does<00:02:38.640> do<00:02:38.850> quite<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.270> lot<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.450> damage<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.110> scope

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
does do quite a lot of damage the scope

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.320 
does do quite a lot of damage the scope
is<00:02:40.560> really<00:02:41.160> really<00:02:41.640> hard<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.030> use<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.300> pretty

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
is really really hard to use it's pretty

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.880 
is really really hard to use it's pretty
one<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.720> worst<00:02:42.960> scopes<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> sniper

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
one of the worst scopes on a sniper

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.920 
one of the worst scopes on a sniper
rifle<00:02:44.100> it's<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.640> jarring<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.210> use<00:02:45.420> especially

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
rifle it's so jarring to use especially

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.630 
rifle it's so jarring to use especially
with<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> recoil<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:46.710> very<00:02:46.980> very<00:02:47.220> zoomed<00:02:47.430> in

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
with the recoil it's very very zoomed in

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.610 
with the recoil it's very very zoomed in
it's<00:02:48.060> very<00:02:48.270> very<00:02:48.480> small<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.020> reticle<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it's very very small the reticle is a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.660 
it's very very small the reticle is a
very<00:02:49.890> great<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.100> think<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.340> scope<00:02:50.520> is

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
very great I think the scope is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.130 
very great I think the scope is
definitely<00:02:51.000> worth<00:02:51.120> part<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.480> weapon<00:02:51.630> but

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
definitely worth part of this weapon but

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.780 
definitely worth part of this weapon but
if<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.410> manage<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.800> put<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> difference<00:02:53.490> go<00:02:53.670> for

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
if you manage to put a difference go for

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.950 
if you manage to put a difference go for
a<00:02:53.820> night<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.060> two<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.240> variable<00:02:54.600> zoom<00:02:54.690> it's

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
a night or two the variable zoom it's

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.870 
a night or two the variable zoom it's
gonna<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.100> much<00:02:56.310> better<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.610> haven't<00:02:56.790> got

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
gonna be so so much better I haven't got

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.340 
gonna be so so much better I haven't got
any<00:02:56.970> gameplay<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.900> variable<00:02:58.200> because

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
any gameplay of the variable because

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.900 
any gameplay of the variable because
he's<00:02:58.440> just<00:02:58.620> my<00:02:58.710> first<00:02:59.010> games<00:02:59.250> using<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.700> but

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
he's just my first games using it but

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.250 
he's just my first games using it but
the<00:03:00.030> variable<00:03:00.330> scope<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> lot<00:03:00.900> better<00:03:01.020> and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
the variable scope is a lot better and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.660 
the variable scope is a lot better and
also<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.560> iron<00:03:01.770> sights<00:03:02.100> that's<00:03:02.340> also

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
also the iron sights that's also

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.100 
also the iron sights that's also
attachment<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.210> can<00:03:03.270> pause<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.870> take

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
attachment you can pause you can take

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.300 
attachment you can pause you can take
off<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> scope<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:04.920> use<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> iron

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
off the scope and just use the iron

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.800 
off the scope and just use the iron
sights<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.580> that's<00:03:05.730> how<00:03:05.850> lots<00:03:06.210> better<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.780> I

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
sights and that's how lots better so I

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.510 
sights and that's how lots better so I
definitely<00:03:07.260> recommend<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.860> second<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.310> can

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
definitely recommend the second you can

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.740 
definitely recommend the second you can
just<00:03:08.760> take<00:03:08.940> off<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.240> scope<00:03:09.450> because<00:03:09.570> it's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
just take off the scope because it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.000 
just take off the scope because it's
really<00:03:10.050> bad<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.410> not<00:03:10.530> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.710> do<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:10.860> any

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
really bad it's not going to do you any

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.710 
really bad it's not going to do you any
favors<00:03:11.370> by<00:03:11.730> said<00:03:11.910> without<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.240> scope<00:03:12.420> I'd<00:03:12.600> say

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
favors by said without a scope I'd say

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.270 
favors by said without a scope I'd say
it's<00:03:12.870> definitely<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.230> lot<00:03:13.440> better<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.100> we<00:03:14.190> can

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
it's definitely a lot better and we can

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.200 
it's definitely a lot better and we can
also<00:03:14.370> take<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.610> look<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:14.850> some<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> events

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210
