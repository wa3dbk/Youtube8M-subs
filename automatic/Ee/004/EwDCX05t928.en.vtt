00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello as are the 10 s 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.150
 prepared a complete comparison between 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.290
 The new Samsung Galaxy S 6 versus the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.010
 Iphone 6 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.010
 let's go with the video 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.090
 i 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.060
 with its approaches and differences 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.700
 both the newly presented samsung 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.680
 galaxy 16 like iphone 6 7 a certain 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.390
 travel in the market would be in this 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.029
 presumably the phones 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.739
 intelligent that will lead the sales the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.640
 time and we're going to buy them and we're going to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.640
 see what is the best 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.480
 samsung has led the fight this year 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.210
 by redesigning your vessel 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.530
 logo the galaxy s 6 from scratch now 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.750
 comes with a metal monocoque 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.760
 clad front and back in gorilla 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.920
 glass 4 the phone is thin and has 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.080
 a thickness of only 6.8 millimeters 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.989
 while the iphone 6 its thickness is 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.460
 6.9 mm according to samsung the metal is 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.129
 stronger than the one that uses the iphone 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.870
 6 so it will not double in conclusion 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.860
 both terminals have the best 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.860
 market design 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 at this point we can say that samsung 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.979
 it does better than up because the iphone 6 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.280
 offers a retina display of 4.7 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.579
 inches with a resolution of 1,334 per 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.710
 750 pixels on the other hand the galaxy 16 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.880
 comes equipped on a 5.1 screen 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.459
 inches and a resolution hd that is 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.649
 2560 x 1440 pixels and a technology 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.209
 super amoled that no doubt sweeps a 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.110
 stroke to all the competition in 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.110
 screen terms 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.060
 the galaxy s 6 is a real beast its 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.400
 processor is manufactured by samsung with 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.770
 64-bit technology and 3 gigs of 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.170
 ram memory the iphone 63 and a hardware 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.210
 poorer but its perfect optimization 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.830
 between hardware and software makes it 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 a very tough competitor in terms of 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.210
 performance and general fluency on the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.860
 hannah sampson's role a step forward 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.870
 but we all know that it points towards 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.100
 the hardware and software function what 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.810
 means that the phone can 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.810
 keep up with the best 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.769
 in this section we are talking about 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.379
 peoples put that is ios versus 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.360
 Android iOS found version 8.1 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.250
 while the s6 will come equipped with 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.200
 android lollipop both have their 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.180
 admirers and haters in both systems 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.860
 everything is clear clear fast and 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.860
 it just works exceptional 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.049
 one of the novelties in these terminals 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.579
 are the payment systems in the s6 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.349
 we found before a country that 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.239
 Unlike other services do not trust 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.370
 in nfc contactless payment machines 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.989
 one of the novelties is that you can 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.109
 emulate the magnetic stripe of a card 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.819
 debit or credit ie 90% 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.680
 the machines will be able to accept the 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.170
 payment both systems work in a way 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.370
 very similar and they use encryption to 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.370
 that your data is safe 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.920
 another one of the differences and that has done 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.930
 emphasis is on the sensor 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.819
 photographic that is able to obtain light 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.709
 at a higher speed and in a way that 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.659
 Even low night photos 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.940
 light conditions get offer 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.629
 good details even surpassing the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.060
 iphone 6 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.400
 this time the galaxy has improved the optics 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.440
 and it has 13 megapixels instead of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.209
 the 8 megapixels of the American terminal 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.069
 although it is already known that the size of 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.400
 megapixels do not guarantee better 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.400
 images 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.540
 this is one of the characteristics in the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.879
 that the iphone more suffers traditionally 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.799
 since it has 1,800 6000 amps 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.959
 that there will be days that you will not reach the end 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.989
 of the day with the smartphone live while 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.030
 that the galaxy s 6 comes equipped with 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.400
 2,550 thousand amparos reaching the end of the 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.349
 day without problems the galaxy s 6 account 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.000
 with wireless charge available something 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.900
 that the japan terminal still does not 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.900
 comes up with technology 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.530
 try to compare the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.630
 versus the iPhone 6 is not an easy task 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.550
 since many factors to take into account 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.590
 everyone has their own opinion 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.840
 about the designs of the two phones 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.460
 but from where we are sitting are 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.220
 almost equal in the department of the 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.140
 looks in the comparison samsung wins 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.180
 the bragging rights in terms 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.070
 of raw specifications from the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.810
 battery size the resolution of the 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.150
 screen and with the number of megapixels 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.440
 served in the camera to paul however 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.300
 there has been a telephone that 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.070
 establishes the rules regarding the 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.410
 stability so it's not that simple 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.810
 How to compare specifications against 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.160
 specifications and finally let me 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.380
 add the comments you with which you 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.930
 stay with the samsung galaxy s 6 or the 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.490
 iphone 6 and good band up here the 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.080
 Today's video do not forget to give it like it's 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.730
 I subscribe to my channel invite you to 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.560
 follow me on my social networks so that 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.450
 We talked a little bit, I hope there was 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.450
 liked see you in the next bye
