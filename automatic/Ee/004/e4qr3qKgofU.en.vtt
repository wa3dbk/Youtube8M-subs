00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
how far I can get in the season so it's

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.170 
how far I can get in the season so it's
going<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.750> quite<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.049> challenge<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:50.610> plan<00:03:51.060> on

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
going to be quite a challenge I plan on

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.660 
going to be quite a challenge I plan on
putting<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.660> on<00:03:51.780> all<00:03:52.049> madden<00:03:52.440> maybe<00:03:53.040> all-pro

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
putting it on all madden maybe all-pro

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.030 
putting it on all madden maybe all-pro
I'm<00:03:54.060> thinking<00:03:54.989> all<00:03:55.170> men<00:03:55.440> might<00:03:55.709> be<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> little

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
I'm thinking all men might be a little

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.470 
I'm thinking all men might be a little
bit<00:03:56.190> too<00:03:56.370> hard<00:03:56.700> for<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.299> ask<00:03:57.480> Madden<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.910> I

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
bit too hard for the ask Madden so I

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.190 
bit too hard for the ask Madden so I
think<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:02.250> might<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.330> put<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.600> on<00:04:03.660> all<00:04:03.870> pro

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
think I might just put it on all pro

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.650 
think I might just put it on all pro
just<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.739> sake<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:06.060> gonna<00:04:06.299> be<00:04:06.420> hard

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
just for the sake of it's gonna be hard

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.289 
just for the sake of it's gonna be hard
as<00:04:06.780> hell<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.019> score<00:04:07.410> because<00:04:08.090> sometimes<00:04:09.090> they

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
as hell to score because sometimes they

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.120 
as hell to score because sometimes they
