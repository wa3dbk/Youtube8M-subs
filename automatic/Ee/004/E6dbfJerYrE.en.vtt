00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.969
 yo guests of torches and a very good day 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.530
 all welcome to a new kingdom 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.059
 and I put all my stuff in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 the chest that I just made 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.380
 because I have just been mining and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.789
 I'll show you to bike soon 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.500
 what i have been doing i have 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.180
 no more turk 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 and I do have railways with me 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.330
 as you can see I have something 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.650
 abandoned mind seen so that is always 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.510
 nice for rails 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.700
 that usually costs quite a bit 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.219
 to happen 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 you need still more that way and yes 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.230
 everything is just nice gravel 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.230
 plus flint 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 here that gravel if it just opens there 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 the flint but I'll be right away 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.690
 I've been like all road stopped 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.239
 I must have some coming and not 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 once in a score happy me a redstone 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.500
 we have had enough redstone here now 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.750
 a yes that is also fast again 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.659
 if eric is busy but i am processing this 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 later to lapis blocks 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.250
 And yes let's see what else I'm missing 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.560
 has to do 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.729
 This doesn't look like something 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.869
 must do away 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.350
 this seat can go and this one too 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.390
 and I also go there room and the iron 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.090
 do anyway as the loaves do away 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.820
 those sandwiches and then I take this for 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 my new tea boxes 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.390
 but then we will go for a while 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.689
 yes back to the mine where I just got 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.759
 have been because we have yes we are 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.140

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.240
 other kingdoms 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.140

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:00.390
 so don't join me, it 's better sorry 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.159
 so I thought what if no yes I can 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.659
 Don't just say that we are a spawner 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.579

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.649
 Lancia that Targa time about you know 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.319
 Never when you find exciting 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.420
 but I have laid this out and you 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.870
 will soon see why if you do 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.930
 to mention 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.790
 no one sits cold hoppa 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.730
 you will soon see why I have this 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.760
 completely excavated 3 wide three high 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.140
 yes with a railroad server it seems to him 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.989
 om it is also once again through 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.769
 but shooting 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.569
 but yes I was lucky and lucky 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.310
 your guest who are back on the kingdom he 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.560
 think just a little bit difficult 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.019
 bit laggy so I smooth it 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.799
 reset very minecraft but here we are 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.010
 weather 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.690
 and he always seems nice again 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.250
 but well here we continue and I have 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.599
 then a waypoint only the letters 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.190
 in excess of design which is even visible that 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.810
 a mistake in my 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.220
 yes in my new trip at least toes 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.049
 of the way he got something wrong 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.549
 done or something so you probably should 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.930
 sometime soon 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.250
 reinstall but as the corpses 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.680
 we on wood and when I shoot again 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.299
 then yes then you will see where I am 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.519
 all right 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.049
 no i first my minecart way it will 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.159
 well then we live from disney's 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.319
 Miffy 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.019
 it really was very short I was a bit 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.810
 is digging and also a minecart 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.329
 ok there it will be both 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.540
 snake it broken here I have a spawner 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.660
 I found here was that the mine and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.519
 i went hashes random i came from this one 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.620
 side I come for a low budget 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.419
 and I saw those bricks 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.709
 and if you see those briggs then there is or 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.169
 someone else been or sat down 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.669
 spawner so i saw this spawner i have 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.310
 dig it all out in the direction of course sales 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.150
 and f and rails laid all the way here 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.819
 to it 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.169
 and well i have all musicals then 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.370
 removed simply replaced with 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.720
 normally coming then some music on one 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.949
 we like stone for the buildings 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.410
 in faction as 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.500
 and I went on digging for a while 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.639
 and I already have one 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.169
 small road to laid I happy 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.919
 trace because I 'm not going to do that 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.680
 with the minecart 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:05.040
 because it really is a very small part of me 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.230
 was digging and you guess it never 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.810
 I came across a spawner here again 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.250
 came here again an exciting I was 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.230
 here you know digging and so and 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.239
 here and then I suddenly saw here again 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.410
 bricks so i thought i'm going there smoothly 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.239
 look 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.729
 hoppa exciting you again our arrival 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.650
 then taken away and again a yes 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.750
 built a trail but this is whole 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.639
 very nice two spanners really 50 blocks out 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.139
 each other or something 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.879
 eric the day you started to 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.960
 redstone for that moment to each other 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.129
 to guide 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.349
 and then we can do that very well 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.969
 for for xp of course free 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:39.830
 xp xp shapes and well what exactly 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:43.310
 exactly how you do that means you 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.379
 just a yes to an area of water 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.460
 a kind of tube grid going up with 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.569
 a piece of water then a sign so that 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.099
 the water does not go further and then again 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.650
 water and so on upwards 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.629
 anything from 22 blocks and then fall into one 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.150
 turn the zombies down that 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.740
 being dragged down and down 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.650
 then they come out of worry that is 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.939
 number 1 hit needed from 20 blocks or something 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.319
 or 22 blocks 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.270
 need only one and then it is 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.680
 that is very much xp forms for the two of us 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.029
 of those 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.479
 tensioners are and are side by side 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.830
 both will pan zombies so yes then 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.169
 just get a lot of spe from me so 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.639
 was really happy that he had found 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.349
 my fax or so tense and then let's 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.610
 maybe so our allies in everyone 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.990
 from allah so far 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.310
 let's maybe also xp for you 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.009
 maybe a small fee or 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.629
 something small or maybe just that 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.740
 free 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.050
 we just have to take a look 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.219
 We'll be very happy with it 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.360

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.750
 seems to him again we are already there 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.099
 when the mine cart goes away for a moment 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.680

 red white black gray call it a lot 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.279
 too many sheep or even a brown one 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.899
 sitting in between is always nice for rest 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.610
 nothing really changes in faction 

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:25.580
