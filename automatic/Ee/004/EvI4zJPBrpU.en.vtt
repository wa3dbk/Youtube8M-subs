 having to pay insurance to pay the deductible 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.330

 then our kneaded door 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.380
 unfortunately I had an accident that could 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.470
 to see that we had no faith in the pits 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 It's all but we're really going 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:38.579
 applying our new crash let's see the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.379
 charca pass a cloth result is not 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.989
 immediate only you have to have a bit of 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 Patience, come on, come on, come on. 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.590

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.560
 third application of the new crash 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.040
