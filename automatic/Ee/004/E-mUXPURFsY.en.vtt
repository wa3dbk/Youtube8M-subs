to give this thing a gray wash if we

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.070 
to give this thing a gray wash if we
take<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> closer<00:00:20.340> look<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.060> piece<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.630> the

Raptor this is the torso part you can

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.210 
Raptor this is the torso part you can
see<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.510> there's<00:00:24.720> grooves<00:00:25.099> indicating<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
see that there's grooves indicating the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.339 
see that there's grooves indicating the
ribs<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.330> lines<00:00:27.570> running<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:27.990> over<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
ribs and this lines running all over the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.380 
ribs and this lines running all over the
body<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.650> bit<00:00:28.859> like<00:00:29.039> panel<00:00:29.400> lines<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> robot

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
body a bit like panel lines on a robot

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.820

acrylic and some white acrylic to make

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
acrylic and some white acrylic to make

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
just get a small amount on the brush and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
just get a small amount on the brush and
apply<00:00:39.660> generously<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> area<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:41.100> you

should be left with is just what's in
the<00:00:55.379> indentation<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.550> crack<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.539> I've

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the indentation in the crack so I've

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.380 
the indentation in the crack so I've
just<00:00:57.660> mixed<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.350> dark<00:00:58.680> blue<00:00:59.180> which<00:01:00.180> will

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
just mixed up this dark blue which will

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.650 
just mixed up this dark blue which will
go<00:01:00.600> along<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> spine<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> dinosaur<00:01:03.390> just

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
go along the spine of the dinosaur just

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:44.420 
go along the spine of the dinosaur just
like<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> arctic<00:01:04.470> t-rex

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.010 

okay<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:45.490> I've<00:01:45.729> now<00:01:45.909> painted<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.539> claws<00:01:46.780> on

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
okay so I've now painted the claws on

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.190 
okay so I've now painted the claws on
the<00:01:47.140> hands<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.950> feet<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.460> dark<00:01:49.390> gray<00:01:49.720> to

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
the hands and the feet a dark gray to

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.740 
the hands and the feet a dark gray to
match<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.740> arctic<00:01:51.250> t-rex<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.060> now<00:01:52.630> we're

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
match the arctic t-rex and now we're

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.020 
match the arctic t-rex and now we're
onto<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.080> finishing<00:01:53.530> details<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.369> if<00:01:54.729> you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
onto the finishing details so if you

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.419 
onto the finishing details so if you
look<00:01:55.240> at<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:55.479> piece<00:01:55.720> here<00:01:56.049> for<00:01:56.259> example<00:01:56.560> you

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
look at this piece here for example you

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.460 
look at this piece here for example you
can<00:01:57.580> see<00:01:57.729> where<00:01:57.909> I've<00:01:58.000> painted<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.600> dark<00:01:59.080> blue

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
can see where I've painted the dark blue

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.800 
can see where I've painted the dark blue
now<00:01:59.979> on<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.250> arctic<00:02:00.640> t-rex<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.299> has<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.570> dark

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
now on the arctic t-rex it has this dark

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.200 
now on the arctic t-rex it has this dark
blue<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.320> it's<00:02:02.439> fringed<00:02:03.009> with<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.850> lighter

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
blue but it's fringed with a lighter

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.810 
blue but it's fringed with a lighter
blue<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:05.140> it's<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.350> very<00:02:05.530> opaque<00:02:06.070> color<00:02:06.579> it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
blue and it's a very opaque color it's

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.930 
blue and it's a very opaque color it's
very<00:02:06.880> obvious<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.780> prominent<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:09.459> thought

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
very obvious and prominent and I thought

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.880 
very obvious and prominent and I thought
the<00:02:10.060> best<00:02:10.239> way<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.450> replicate<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:11.260> would<00:02:11.739> be

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
the best way to replicate that would be

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.390 
the best way to replicate that would be
with<00:02:12.069> one<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.459> these<00:02:12.610> which<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.569> chalk<00:02:13.930> pen

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
with one of these which is a chalk pen

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.520 
with one of these which is a chalk pen
now<00:02:15.400> essentially<00:02:15.880> you'll<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.239> these<00:02:16.530> outside

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
now essentially you'll see these outside

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.250 
now essentially you'll see these outside
bars<00:02:17.799> or<00:02:18.040> pubs<00:02:18.250> where<00:02:18.519> they'll<00:02:18.730> chalk<00:02:19.299> up<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
bars or pubs where they'll chalk up the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.039 
bars or pubs where they'll chalk up the
day's<00:02:20.470> recipes<00:02:21.100> or<00:02:21.540> offers<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.690> they've<00:02:22.840> got

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
day's recipes or offers that they've got

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.640 
day's recipes or offers that they've got
on<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.190> really<00:02:24.400> opaque<00:02:24.940> thick

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
on but it's a really opaque thick

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.530 
on but it's a really opaque thick
pigment<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:27.400> really<00:02:27.610> stands<00:02:27.940> out<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.269> I'm

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
pigment that really stands out so I'm

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.300 
pigment that really stands out so I'm
hoping<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.290> will<00:02:29.440> have<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.680> desired<00:02:30.130> effect

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
hoping this will have the desired effect

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.160 
hoping this will have the desired effect
so<00:02:31.060> what<00:02:31.209> I'm<00:02:31.299> going<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.480> do<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:31.900> draw

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so what I'm going to do is just draw

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.960 
so what I'm going to do is just draw
around<00:02:32.290> these<00:02:32.650> dark<00:02:32.890> blue<00:02:33.040> areas<00:02:33.459> with<00:02:33.849> this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
around these dark blue areas with this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:46.559 
around these dark blue areas with this
light<00:02:34.209> blue

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.509 

okay<00:02:47.379> I<00:02:47.409> think<00:02:47.560> that's<00:02:47.739> come<00:02:47.980> out<00:02:48.069> really<00:02:48.370> well

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
okay I think that's come out really well

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.130 
okay I think that's come out really well
you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.849> see<00:02:49.030> here<00:02:49.180> all<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.450> pieces<00:02:49.659> fringe

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
you can see here all the pieces fringe

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.380 
you can see here all the pieces fringe
with<00:02:50.379> that<00:02:50.560> blue<00:02:50.799> line<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:51.849> on<00:02:51.969> the<00:02:52.090> head<00:02:52.269> I've

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
with that blue line and on the head I've

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.789 
with that blue line and on the head I've
just<00:02:52.540> added<00:02:52.689> some<00:02:52.930> little<00:02:53.170> highlights<00:02:53.590> of

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
just added some little highlights of

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.740 
just added some little highlights of
light<00:02:53.980> blue<00:02:54.250> in<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.549> feathers<00:02:54.879> and<00:02:55.239> also

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
light blue in the feathers and also

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.140 
light blue in the feathers and also
along<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.140> head<00:02:56.349> here<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.709> some<00:02:56.980> little

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
along the head here just some little

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.300 
along the head here just some little
scales<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.420> light<00:02:58.659> blue<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.129> these

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
scales of light blue and on these

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.920 
scales of light blue and on these
feathered<00:03:00.730> pieces<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.359> arms<00:03:01.780> I've

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
feathered pieces on the arms I've

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.140 
feathered pieces on the arms I've
actually<00:03:02.079> used<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.650> chalk<00:03:02.950> pen<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.519> create

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
actually used the chalk pen to create

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.490 
actually used the chalk pen to create
this<00:03:04.299> sort<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.569> alternate<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:05.170> blue<00:03:05.349> and

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
this sort of alternate and blue and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.869 
this sort of alternate and blue and
white<00:03:05.650> effect<00:03:05.829> which<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.400> think<00:03:06.549> that's<00:03:06.700> pretty

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
white effect which I think that's pretty

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.210 
white effect which I think that's pretty
cool<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.290> all<00:03:08.470> that's<00:03:08.560> left<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.890> do<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.129> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
cool so all that's left to do on the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.069 
cool so all that's left to do on the
paint<00:03:09.459> job<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.819> paint<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> interior<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
paint job is paint the interior of the

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.129 
paint job is paint the interior of the
mouth<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.280> eye<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.930> unfortunately<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
mouth and the eye and unfortunately the

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.229 
mouth and the eye and unfortunately the
larger<00:03:14.500> brush<00:03:14.709> will<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.250> do<00:03:15.549> so<00:03:15.909> I've<00:03:16.030> had<00:03:16.209> to

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
larger brush will not do so I've had to

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.780 
larger brush will not do so I've had to
pick<00:03:16.540> up<00:03:16.689> a<00:03:16.840> specialist<00:03:17.439> brush<00:03:17.650> which<00:03:18.579> has<00:03:18.760> a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
pick up a specialist brush which has a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.080 
pick up a specialist brush which has a
very<00:03:19.120> fine<00:03:19.629> point<00:03:20.079> as<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.379> can<00:03:20.560> see<00:03:20.739> here<00:03:21.090> it's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
very fine point as you can see here it's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.720 
very fine point as you can see here it's
a<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.540> really<00:03:22.780> tiny<00:03:23.079> point<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.220> also<00:03:24.489> very

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
a really really tiny point and also very

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.490 
a really really tiny point and also very
short<00:03:25.120> as<00:03:25.299> well<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:25.659> I<00:03:25.689> can<00:03:25.750> almost<00:03:25.989> use<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.409> as

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
short as well so I can almost use it as

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.710 
short as well so I can almost use it as
like<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.680> pencil<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.760> gather<00:03:27.970> sort<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.299> detail

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
like a pencil to gather sort of detail

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:42.839

it's<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.319> tiny<00:04:03.129> now<00:04:03.670> for<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:03.939> opposite<00:04:04.360> side

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.030 

we<00:04:12.320> go<00:04:13.330> just<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.480> little<00:04:14.750> splash<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.530> black<00:04:15.800> on

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
we go just a little splash of black on

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.729 
we go just a little splash of black on
the<00:04:16.190> eyeball<00:04:16.580> there<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.299> go<00:04:17.420> prefer<00:04:17.750> oh<00:04:17.780> how

the eyeball there and go prefer oh how

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.200 
the eyeball there and go prefer oh how
I've<00:04:18.890> done<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.160> on<00:04:19.250> this<00:04:19.430> side<00:04:19.700> it's<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:22.910> little

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
I've done it on this side it's a little

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.140 
I've done it on this side it's a little
less<00:04:23.360> generous<00:04:24.430> okay<00:04:25.430> here<00:04:25.670> we<00:04:25.760> go<00:04:25.790> the

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
less generous okay here we go the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.590 
less generous okay here we go the
hardest<00:04:26.570> part<00:04:26.840> in<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.050> world<00:04:28.270> it's<00:04:29.270> getting

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
hardest part in the world it's getting

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.520 
hardest part in the world it's getting
this<00:04:29.690> white<00:04:30.050> dot<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.490> center<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.150> eye

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
this white dot in the center of the eye

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.160 
this white dot in the center of the eye
there<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.450> think<00:04:35.450> that's<00:04:35.690> it

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
there it is I think that's it

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.020 
there it is I think that's it
that's<00:04:36.290> all<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.560> needs<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:37.340> can't<00:04:37.580> really<00:04:37.760> see

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
that's all it needs you can't really see

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.280 
that's all it needs you can't really see
it<00:04:38.060> then<00:04:38.300> if<00:04:38.390> you<00:04:38.480> can<00:04:38.630> see<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:38.900> in<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.110> light

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
it then if you can see it in the light

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:54.640 
it then if you can see it in the light
there<00:04:39.500> but<00:04:39.710> that's<00:04:40.310> all<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.730> needs

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.399 

so<00:04:55.650> here<00:04:56.159> is<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.669> completed<00:04:57.240> Raptor<00:04:57.990> model

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
so here is the completed Raptor model

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.189 
so here is the completed Raptor model
and<00:04:59.120> unfortunately<00:05:00.120> everything<00:05:00.780> went<00:05:00.960> wrong

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
and unfortunately everything went wrong

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.670 
and unfortunately everything went wrong
that<00:05:01.439> possibly<00:05:01.830> could<00:05:02.129> in<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.520> last<00:05:02.759> hurdle<00:05:03.120> I

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
that possibly could in the last hurdle I

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.149 
that possibly could in the last hurdle I
wanted<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.860> give<00:05:05.729> this<00:05:05.849> guy<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.389> clear<00:05:06.749> coat

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
wanted to give this guy a clear coat

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.529 
wanted to give this guy a clear coat
just<00:05:08.159> to<00:05:08.279> seal<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.789> paint<00:05:09.060> job<00:05:09.330> and

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
just to seal the paint job and

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.809 
just to seal the paint job and
unfortunately<00:05:10.409> I<00:05:10.529> picked<00:05:10.979> up<00:05:11.159> the<00:05:11.340> can<00:05:11.610> of

together now David silver in the

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.100 
together now David silver in the
instructions<00:05:56.789> provided<00:05:57.240> says<00:05:57.870> that<00:05:58.020> you

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
instructions provided says that you

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.959

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
should really only pose this once so

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.119 
should really only pose this once so
I've<00:06:00.449> chosen<00:06:00.659> this<00:06:00.930> dynamic<00:06:01.439> leaping<00:06:01.860> pose

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:02.129

I've chosen this dynamic leaping pose
very<00:06:02.490> sort<00:06:02.669> of<00:06:02.699> Jurassic<00:06:03.150> Park<00:06:03.389> asked<00:06:03.689> and<00:06:03.960> I
