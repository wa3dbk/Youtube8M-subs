rope<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.660> starters<00:00:22.080> first<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.250> my

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
rope for starters first of all my

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.720 
rope for starters first of all my
favorite<00:00:23.609> rope<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> plastic<00:00:24.750> rope<00:00:25.019> with

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
favorite rope with the plastic rope with

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.480 
favorite rope with the plastic rope with
plastic<00:00:26.730> foam<00:00:26.970> covered<00:00:27.779> handles<00:00:28.369> it's<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
plastic foam covered handles it's a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.299 
plastic foam covered handles it's a
little<00:00:29.789> less<00:00:30.000> forgiving<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.900> rope<00:00:31.309> rope

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
little less forgiving and a rope rope

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.299 
little less forgiving and a rope rope
but<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.000> find<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> rope<00:00:33.719> ropes<00:00:34.110> float<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> bit

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
but I find the rope ropes float a bit

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.310 
but I find the rope ropes float a bit
too<00:00:35.579> much<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.059> they're<00:00:36.149> slower<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.140> you're

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
too much and they're slower so if you're

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
too much and they're slower so if you're
a<00:00:37.350> beginner<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:38.160> rope<00:00:39.290> jump<00:00:40.290> rope<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.399> great

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
a beginner a rope jump rope is a great

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
a beginner a rope jump rope is a great
way<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> start<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.110> you're<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> get

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
way to start but you're not going to get

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.279 
way to start but you're not going to get
very<00:00:43.890> fast<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> plastic<00:00:46.110> or

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
very fast with that one so a plastic or

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
very fast with that one so a plastic or
a<00:00:46.350> leather<00:00:46.559> rope<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.190> great<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:47.969> less

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
a leather rope is great but less

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.170 
a leather rope is great but less
forgiving<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.800> start<00:00:50.190> jumping<00:00:50.730> rope<00:00:50.879> you're

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
forgiving to start jumping rope you're

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.670 
forgiving to start jumping rope you're
actually<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.719> even<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> jump<00:00:52.410> rope

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
actually not even going to jump rope

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
actually not even going to jump rope
you're<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> simulate<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.390> jump<00:00:54.750> rope<00:00:54.960> by

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you're going to simulate a jump rope by

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.310 
you're going to simulate a jump rope by
putting<00:00:55.920> both<00:00:55.969> handles<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.390> hand<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
putting both handles in one hand and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
putting both handles in one hand and
you're<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> arm<00:00:59.940> action<00:01:00.300> with

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you're going to do the arm action with

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
you're going to do the arm action with
one<00:01:00.930> hand<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> other<00:01:01.829> hand<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
one hand and then the other hand and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.549 
one hand and then the other hand and
then<00:01:02.940> every<00:01:03.270> time<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.690> rope<00:01:03.870> hits<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> ground

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
then every time the rope hits the ground

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
then every time the rope hits the ground
you're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> try<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.549> coordinate<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you're going to try and coordinate a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
you're going to try and coordinate a
jump<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
jump so first of all we are going to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.180 
jump so first of all we are going to
just<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> swing

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
just do that at the swing

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.220 
just do that at the swing
notice<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:10.760> my<00:01:10.910> elbows<00:01:11.090> in<00:01:11.450> nice<00:01:11.870> and<00:01:12.200> tight

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
notice that my elbows in nice and tight

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.080 
notice that my elbows in nice and tight
to<00:01:12.650> my<00:01:12.940> body<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.770> all<00:01:15.770> I'm<00:01:16.220> doing<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:16.820> working

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
to my body and all I'm doing is working

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.680 
to my body and all I'm doing is working
my<00:01:17.540> wrists<00:01:18.850> start<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.890> everytime<00:01:22.690> several

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
my wrists start to everytime several

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.210 
my wrists start to everytime several
hits<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.140> ground<00:01:24.380> I'm<00:01:25.130> going<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.550> start<00:01:25.820> to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
hits the ground I'm going to start to

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.930 
hits the ground I'm going to start to
coordinate<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.960> jump<00:01:29.960> all<00:01:30.830> right<00:01:31.070> Scott<00:01:31.520> step

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
coordinate a jump all right Scott step

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.760 
coordinate a jump all right Scott step
one<00:01:32.360> you're<00:01:32.750> going<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.990> try<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.230> on<00:01:33.590> both

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
one you're going to try that on both

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.290 
one you're going to try that on both
hands<00:01:34.130> now<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.090> second<00:01:35.740> step<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:37.040> really<00:01:37.610> just

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
hands now the second step is really just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.140 
hands now the second step is really just
our<00:01:38.510> walking's<00:01:39.260> on<00:01:39.530> jump<00:01:40.040> rope<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.610> little<00:01:41.030> bit

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
our walking's on jump rope a little bit

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.090 
our walking's on jump rope a little bit
harder<00:01:41.510> for<00:01:41.690> me<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.930> do<00:01:42.080> in<00:01:42.200> my<00:01:42.230> studio<00:01:42.380> here

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
harder for me to do in my studio here

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.560 
harder for me to do in my studio here
but<00:01:43.310> basically<00:01:43.760> what<00:01:44.030> you're<00:01:44.180> going<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.360> do

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
but basically what you're going to do

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.640 
but basically what you're going to do
spring<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.680> jumper<00:01:46.100> over<00:01:46.400> step<00:01:47.330> over<00:01:47.660> step

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
spring the jumper over step over step

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.260 
spring the jumper over step over step
and<00:01:49.160> you're<00:01:49.310> just<00:01:49.490> going<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.730> keep<00:01:49.940> walking

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
and you're just going to keep walking

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.290 
and you're just going to keep walking
and<00:01:50.900> as<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.980> you're<00:01:52.520> going<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.940> need<00:01:53.090> some

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
and as you you're going to need some

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.860 
and as you you're going to need some
space<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.660> might<00:01:54.170> do<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.440> outside<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.330> you

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
space you might do it outside but as you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.500 
space you might do it outside but as you
are<00:01:57.680> getting<00:01:58.070> over<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.550> rope<00:01:58.760> you're<00:01:59.390> going

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
are getting over the rope you're going

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.580 
are getting over the rope you're going
to<00:01:59.600> turn<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.990> into<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.290> jog<00:02:00.740> all<00:02:01.340> right<00:02:02.590> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
to turn it into a jog all right the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.690 
to turn it into a jog all right the
third<00:02:03.890> step<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.640> you're<00:02:05.090> just<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:06.700> slow

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
third step is you're just going to slow

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.980 
third step is you're just going to slow
one<00:02:08.510> I<00:02:08.780> missed<00:02:09.200> at<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.530> time<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.670> step<00:02:11.000> stop

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
one I missed at that time one step stop

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.900 
one I missed at that time one step stop
get<00:02:12.860> set<00:02:13.160> up<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:14.450> step<00:02:14.840> stop<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.040> then<00:02:16.580> you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
get set up one step stop and then you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.740 
get set up one step stop and then you
can<00:02:17.239> go<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.770> ten<00:02:18.770> steps<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.000> don't<00:02:20.360> plan<00:02:20.690> on

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
can go to ten steps so don't plan on

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.600 
can go to ten steps so don't plan on
doing<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.470> hundred<00:02:21.650> skips<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> roll<00:02:22.580> for

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
starters and your your pace is totally

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.250 
starters and your your pace is totally
up<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.610> there's<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.940> million<00:02:29.330> wow<00:02:30.050> maybe
