00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.019
 so much in this kitchen that I'm leaving 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.590
 to approach the first specialist 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.980
 Favourite 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.970
 as well as good bozo is we are going to 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.950
 1 sorrentino 100% integrated in the mass 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.570
 without using refined sand as for 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.760
 let it be seen that something can be done 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.710
 healthier people and that is not so 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.560
 complicated as one that is not that 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.470
 we can make double or triple ration a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.030
 part we eat and remains freeze and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.949
 Benghazi to do a lot of freezing 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.870
 invite families well I'll leave you there 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.090
 it comes out clear amparo clear that yes something very 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.620
 express good dale evans good let's go 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.110
 boot with this super preparation 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.360
 easy what I have here is 500 grams of 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.579
 whole wheat flour if organic 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.460
 much better remember you we 're going to 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.980
 put a pinch of salt sea salt 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.170
 comes out and is the one he used and here 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.260
 What I have is 300 cubic centimeters 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.510
 of liquid always a part of water and 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.940
 the rest of oil to have that grace 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.060
 that consistency simply what 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.549
 I have to do now is to mix 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.049
 I mix calm I enjoy because what 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.290
 cute this kitchen you need to start 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.170
 enjoy a little more 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.120
 and use both their singles these if 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.800
 you have a processor and you like it 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.960
 more you can do it quietly 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.520
 processor but look how easy that is 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.649
 once I join the mass now yes 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.979
 I put my hand and start I start 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.979
 Mix 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.700
 that this super light mass is formed 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.470
 in this case we do not use eggs because 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.600
 you really do not need the masses with 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.250
 search a bit harder then I 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.150
 What I need is this is 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.440
 consistency that look at this or show here 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.070
 so now what we have to do 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.190
 It is kneading 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.520
 just one side the other quiet 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.650
 listening to music is fundamental 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.780
 enjoying and there I have it how long 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.510
 I have to knead until the dough 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.290
 it is very smooth and now what I have 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.500
 here what you will show is the mass 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.510
 prepared has already amassed then with a 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.030
 little flour on the counter does not have to 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.510
 Exceed with the amount of flour 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.620
 crushed 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.760
 and now yes if we have this machine the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.569
 factory to make pasta 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.959
 which we have started we passed 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.700
 the mass once we see the consistency 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.139
 that is very well soft 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.629
 then we put a little more 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.910
 flour and we pass it again how many 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.780
 times 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.060
 until I fit well elastic 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.160
 Super elastic old 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.260
 and do not worry, you can look at it 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.760
 look, look how your work does not have to 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.530
 to be afraid of the masses 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.630
 if you developed gluten 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.849
 lamas or else I will be super 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.849
 elastic then we always go down 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.290
 in euros shorts skirts I stayed more 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.010
 finite then already when I have it like that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.010
 a little bit longer 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.420
 from short to medium 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.300
 left the mass here and now if I work more 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.150
 relaxed then and going down I'm going down 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.920
 to achieve the ideal thickness Now 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.600
 secret of friends 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.330
 if you have patience and want the 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.150
 pasta is well well rich has it 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.520
 to knead well finite well finite spend 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.910
 for the finest point you have so 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.610
 after the torrentinos 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.690
 we noticed that the dough is not so thick 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.440
 then that is fundamental 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.650
 I have the mass stretched here 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.520
 I have one more and now 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.710
 with patience and tranquility 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.710
 we will crush a bit ay 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.240
 to put the stuffing that was what 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.240
 I made the stuffing something super easy and 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.760
 practical pumpkin baked in the kitchen 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:03.270
 30 minutes process it with the seeds 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.270
 I added a little bit of nut 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.060
 a little seed if you have always remember 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.480
 put the ground seeds flavor it 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.690
 with the fresh grass you have and we're 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.610
 barbarian 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.980
 I show you obviously you are going to 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.049
 finish is going to put the 8 personal 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.050
 Sample closes 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.780
 there we cover a little bit slowly for 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.010
 take out the air and now if it crushes 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.010
 crush crushes 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.480
 look and I stay here the first 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:39.130
 Sorrentino and is taking out the dough 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.990
 and now if I have to go to cook 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.920
 because I have the sauce 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.520
 that a super super fast sauce but 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.520
 super express 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.010
 we are taking them out with patience 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.860
 we have here then if you accompany me 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.840
 let's cook this straw boiling water 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.850
 fundamental a window that is 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.100
 boiling water here I already have a few 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.020
 torrentinos that ahead I'm going 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.960
 putting how much time 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.400
 about five minutes will be barbarous 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.930
 we are going to put a lot of amount because 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.970
 they saw all the guys all want it 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.150
 try how to put everything we are going to be 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.150
 generous 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.770
 now I do stir this is the only 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.040
 secret of the stir just barely 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.530
 we put any dough 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.020
 and let him cook quietly while 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.150
 so much now if I look from hillside to 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.560
 look for the brussel sprouts because 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.380
 because we always have to keep 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.130
 the slopes and we cook them cooking 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.430
 steam how much time 67 minutes 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.750
 roughly clean the countertop 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.060
 we are also going to clean up a little bit 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.210
 hands and let's make this sauce to 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.240
 see the sauce as he likes to and super 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.100
 practical and simple fast I have the 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.900
 deposits that I had left over, start 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.080
 consume deposits because they are super 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.060
 healthy guys like it a lot 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.300
 try these kinds of recipes that are going 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.300
 love 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.630
 here what I have is a little bit of salt 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.290
 there is calling me water we are going to 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.290
 uncover what 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.020
 a little bit of salt 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.120
 brewer's yeast so we replace the 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.600
 cheese just for that I use the 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.600
 Brewer's yeast a clove of garlic 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.600
 Water 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:30.620
 and to process you want to put oil 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.620
 olive barbarian olive 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.650
 the cream that we are going to achieve 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.249
 30 seconds 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:55.349
 just how I process it 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:57.659
 let's go to the pan is also is 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:59.760
 necessary to warm it up a lot simply 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:02.650
 I want to put it 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:07.919
 as to see 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.919
 the color and body that this sauce takes 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.020
 I have the torrentinos 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.320

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:29.120
 do not drip anything they did not break 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:32.410
 fundamental these now yes 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.410
 olive oil 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.759
 some cherry tomatoes to give it a little 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.759
 of color 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:47.520

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.520
 let's serve it 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:54.330
