somehow don't do it all right
that's<00:00:28.019> basically<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:28.529> letter<00:00:28.710> anxiety

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that's basically what letter anxiety

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.450 
that's basically what letter anxiety
means<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.699> used<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.449> somewhat

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
means and I used to have that somewhat

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.040 
means and I used to have that somewhat
but<00:00:32.460> never<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> lot

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but never really in the way that a lot

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.520 
but never really in the way that a lot
of<00:00:34.260> people<00:00:34.649> seem<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.309> having<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.530> but

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of people seem to be having it but

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
of people seem to be having it but
there's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> couple<00:00:37.950> things<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.399> say

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
there's a couple things that can say

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.430 
there's a couple things that can say
about<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.910> suppose<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.690> very<00:00:39.960> first<00:00:40.230> thing

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
about it I suppose the very first thing

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.500 
about it I suppose the very first thing
to<00:00:40.649> realize<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.120> having

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
to realize is that if you're not having

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.250 
to realize is that if you're not having
fun<00:00:42.950> don't<00:00:43.950> play<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.660> might<00:00:45.660> sound<00:00:45.960> very

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
fun don't play that might sound very

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.319 
fun don't play that might sound very
obvious<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.370> enjoy<00:00:47.579> playing

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
obvious but if you don't enjoy playing

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
obvious but if you don't enjoy playing
the<00:00:48.570> game<00:00:48.780> why<00:00:49.289> are<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.530> playing<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.250> game

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the game why are you playing the game

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.830 
the game why are you playing the game
and<00:00:50.670> why<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> willing<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.329> play<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> game

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and why are you willing to play the game

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360 
and why are you willing to play the game
because<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.379> enjoying<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.890> right<00:00:52.980> if

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
because you're not enjoying it right if

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
because you're not enjoying it right if
you<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.149> enjoy<00:00:54.750> watching<00:00:55.050> life<00:00:55.379> streams

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you actually enjoy watching life streams

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
you actually enjoy watching life streams
more<00:00:55.980> which<00:00:56.489> could<00:00:56.699> free<00:00:56.879> won't<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> case

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
more which could free won't be the case

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.200 
more which could free won't be the case
just<00:00:58.379> accept<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> watch<00:00:59.489> live<00:00:59.789> streams

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
just accept that and watch live streams

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.260 
just accept that and watch live streams
because<00:01:00.960> there's<00:01:01.770> no<00:01:01.890> point<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.850> winding

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
because there's no point in like winding

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
because there's no point in like winding
yourself<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.809> over<00:01:04.049> something<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.400> know

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a lotta anxiety when reality it's just

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800

that you don't prefer playing you prefer

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
that you don't prefer playing you prefer
watching<00:01:10.049> live<00:01:10.350> streams<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:10.860> watching

that's totally cool all right so that's

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.770 
that's totally cool all right so that's
the<00:01:14.340> first<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> realize<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.659> might

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the first thing to realize that it might

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
the first thing to realize that it might
just<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.049> something<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.740> prefer<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
just be something that you prefer the

just be something that you prefer the
second<00:01:18.630> thing<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.869> realize<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.799> do

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
second thing to realize if you really do

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.499 
second thing to realize if you really do
want<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> improve<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.970> only<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.299> you've<00:01:21.479> got

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
want to improve the only way you've got

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.310 
want to improve the only way you've got
to<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.729> by<00:01:23.729> simply<00:01:24.119> playing<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.290> are

the<00:01:37.979> strategies<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> actual<00:01:39.710> stuff

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
the strategies and the actual stuff

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
the strategies and the actual stuff
basically<00:01:42.390> you're<00:01:43.140> gonna<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> have

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
basically you're gonna have to have

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700 
basically you're gonna have to have
muscle<00:01:44.369> memory<00:01:44.670> which<00:01:45.030> takes<00:01:45.899> hundreds<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
muscle memory which takes hundreds and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.469 
muscle memory which takes hundreds and
hundreds<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.220> probably<00:01:47.399> thousands<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.240> games

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
hundreds and probably thousands of games

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.999 
hundreds and probably thousands of games
if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> become<00:01:49.380> anywhere<00:01:49.799> like

all<00:01:52.890> play<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.030> 10<00:01:54.299> plus<00:01:54.600> hours<00:01:54.990> every

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
all play up to like 10 plus hours every

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.499 
all play up to like 10 plus hours every

single day or Starcraft 2 30 days a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.230 
single day or Starcraft 2 30 days a
month<00:01:57.890> simply<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.700> muscle<00:01:59.939> memory

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
month simply to get that muscle memory

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.569 
month simply to get that muscle memory
down<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.070> been<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.340> every

down and to you know have been in every
single<00:02:02.790> situation<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.509> that's<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> first

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
single situation so that's the first

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.359 
single situation so that's the first
thing<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> realize<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> improve

thing to realize if you want to improve

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880 
thing to realize if you want to improve
you're<00:02:06.329> gonna<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.020> apply<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.560> much<00:02:07.710> as

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
you're gonna have to apply as much as

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.170 
you're gonna have to apply as much as
possible

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
possible

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.240 
possible
the<00:02:10.390> next<00:02:10.720> thing<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.080> if<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.620> are<00:02:11.650> really

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the next thing is that if you are really

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.940 
the next thing is that if you are really
feeling<00:02:12.370> bad<00:02:13.030> about<00:02:13.570> improving<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.800> the

players play and you get in the heart of
division<00:02:58.660> division<00:02:59.440> rank<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.100> League<00:03:00.430> don't

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
division division rank and League don't

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.020 
division division rank and League don't
really<00:03:01.239> represent<00:03:01.420> your<00:03:01.959> skill<00:03:02.320> very<00:03:02.980> well<00:03:03.459> at

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
really represent your skill very well at

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.170 
really represent your skill very well at
all<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:06.070> that's<00:03:06.250> another<00:03:06.520> thing<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.820> keep<00:03:07.060> in

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
all so that's another thing to keep in

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.620 
all so that's another thing to keep in
mind<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.750> last<00:03:07.959> thing<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.320> guess<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:10.060> also

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
mind and the last thing I guess to also

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.690 
mind and the last thing I guess to also
do<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.470> realize<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.920> it's<00:03:12.190> literally

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
do is to realize that it's literally

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.600 
do is to realize that it's literally
just<00:03:12.730> chemicals<00:03:13.769> happening<00:03:14.769> somewhere<00:03:15.220> over

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
just chemicals happening somewhere over

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.060 
just chemicals happening somewhere over
your<00:03:15.850> head<00:03:16.030> where<00:03:16.330> like<00:03:16.540> having<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> survival

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
instinct that we have developed over

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.320 
instinct that we have developed over
like<00:03:19.750> millions<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.350> years<00:03:21.060> telling<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.150> like
