that I think it brings it down to 119 or

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.270 
that I think it brings it down to 119 or
something<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.469> there<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.500> also<00:00:49.829> the

of this so real easy down box so let's

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.449 
of this so real easy down box so let's
take<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> slip<00:02:24.580> off<00:02:24.760> you've<00:02:25.000> got<00:02:25.239> your

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
controller and I'll go ahead and put

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.110 
controller and I'll go ahead and put
this<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> table<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.790> take<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> look

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
this on the table so we can take a look

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.809 
this on the table so we can take a look
at<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.680> first<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.130> your<00:02:39.280> DJ<00:02:39.640> Hero

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.150 
at that first so this is your DJ Hero
controller<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.450> kind<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.750> mimics<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.160> pattern

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
controller it kind of mimics the pattern

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.300 
controller it kind of mimics the pattern
of<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.610> techniques<00:02:43.269> platter<00:02:44.099> sort<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.190> but

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
of the techniques platter sort of but

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.900 
of the techniques platter sort of but
not<00:02:45.340> really

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
not really

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.880 
not really
and<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.080> can<00:02:47.170> see<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.410> can<00:02:47.530> spin<00:02:47.769> it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
and as you can see you can spin it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.039 
and as you can see you can spin it
freely<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:49.030> does<00:02:49.239> look<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.630> has<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.810> little

freely it does look like it has a little

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.009 
freely it does look like it has a little
bit<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.349> play<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:51.569> you've<00:02:52.569> got<00:02:52.750> three
