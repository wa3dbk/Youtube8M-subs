00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
going to test is not only the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.870 
going to test is not only the
waterproofing<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.740> sony<00:00:19.949> xperia<00:00:20.340> z2<00:00:20.550> but

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
waterproofing on the sony xperia z2 but

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.040 
waterproofing on the sony xperia z2 but
also<00:00:21.230> whether<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.740> hear<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.760> audio<00:00:24.180> once

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you put the z2 inside the water so let's

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.680 
you put the z2 inside the water so let's
turn<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.770> song<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.130> let's<00:00:36.000> put<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> z2

turn on the song and let's put the z2

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:54.740 
turn on the song and let's put the z2
inside<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> water

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.670 

what<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:56.010> noticed<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:57.210> away<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.840> s

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
what I have noticed right away is that s

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.940 
what I have noticed right away is that s
one<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.580> z2<00:01:00.060> enters<00:01:00.810> into<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.410> water<00:01:01.620> not

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
one as the z2 enters into the water not

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.870 
one as the z2 enters into the water not
only<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.340> hear<00:01:03.350> less<00:01:04.350> audio<00:01:04.949> output<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:05.729> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
only I hear less audio output because of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.750 
only I hear less audio output because of
the<00:01:06.000> water<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.960> even<00:01:07.200> though<00:01:07.350> i<00:01:07.500> took<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.400> z2

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the water but even though i took the z2

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.150 
the water but even though i took the z2
out<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> water<00:01:09.600> still<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.440> volume<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> not

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
out of the water still the volume is not

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.960 
out of the water still the volume is not
as<00:01:11.790> loud<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:13.020> was<00:01:13.260> before<00:01:13.440> i<00:01:13.979> put<00:01:14.729> this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
as loud as it was before i put this

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:33.500 
as loud as it was before i put this
device<00:01:15.390> inside<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.380> water

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.860 

after<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.530> shot<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.250> video<00:01:35.430> z2<00:01:36.090> XD<00:01:36.420> took<00:01:36.600> quite

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
after I shot this video z2 XD took quite

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.340 
after I shot this video z2 XD took quite
some<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.750> same<00:01:39.990> volume

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
some time to get to the same volume

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.850 
some time to get to the same volume
level<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.120> before<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.810> put<00:01:43.230> it<00:01:43.380> into<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
level that was before I put it into the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.540 
level that was before I put it into the
water<00:01:44.040> probably<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.260> the

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
water probably that's because of the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.400 
water probably that's because of the
waterproofing<00:01:47.550> inside<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.510> speakers<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.260> I

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
waterproofing inside the speakers or I

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.620 
waterproofing inside the speakers or I
don't<00:01:49.650> know<00:01:49.830> what<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.370> main<00:01:50.580> reason<00:01:51.030> but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
don't know what is the main reason but

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.620 
don't know what is the main reason but
this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.440> happens<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:53.270> far<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.300> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
this is how it happens as far as the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.390 
this is how it happens as far as the
touchscreen<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.530> concerned<00:01:56.070> than

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
touchscreen is concerned than

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.630 
touchscreen is concerned than
touchscreen<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.840> times<00:01:58.680> work<00:01:59.310> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
touchscreen actually at times work so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.790 
touchscreen actually at times work so
pretty<00:01:59.940> well<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.900> times<00:02:01.140> actually<00:02:01.440> it

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
pretty well but at times actually it

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.840 
pretty well but at times actually it
records<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:03.590> touch<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> water

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
records the touch because of the water

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.730 
records the touch because of the water
but<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.840> actually<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.820> workaround<00:02:08.820> and

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
but there is actually a workaround and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.560 
but there is actually a workaround and
you<00:02:10.740> can<00:02:10.979> actually<00:02:11.220> block<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.910> touch<00:02:12.300> screen

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
you can actually block the touch screen

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.980 
you can actually block the touch screen
when<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.500> put<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> device<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> water<00:02:14.990> so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
when you put the device in the water so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.280 
when you put the device in the water so
you<00:02:16.740> might<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.010> thinking<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.290> Bluetooth

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you might be thinking that a Bluetooth

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.290 
you might be thinking that a Bluetooth
speaker<00:02:19.650> similar<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.760> will<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.270> a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
speaker similar to this one will be a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.780 
speaker similar to this one will be a
good<00:02:21.630> solution<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> sound<00:02:22.980> problems<00:02:23.490> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
good solution to the sound problems and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.290 
good solution to the sound problems and
a<00:02:24.510> blues<00:02:24.720> bluetooth<00:02:25.440> speaker<00:02:25.830> since<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:27.150> does

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
a blues bluetooth speaker since it does

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.270 
a blues bluetooth speaker since it does
not<00:02:27.330> go<00:02:27.660> inside<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.050> water<00:02:28.350> will<00:02:29.250> actually

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
not go inside the water will actually

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.300 
not go inside the water will actually
give<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.000> good<00:02:30.390> sound<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.500> let's<00:02:31.860> pair<00:02:32.070> this

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
give you a good sound so let's pair this

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.460 
give you a good sound so let's pair this
Bluetooth<00:02:32.700> speaker<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.330> let's<00:02:33.720> try<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.020> one

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
Bluetooth speaker and let's try this one

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:50.580 
Bluetooth speaker and let's try this one
I<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.860> already<00:02:35.070> paired<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:36.510> let's<00:02:36.900> test

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.950 

so<00:02:51.590> magically<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.460> phone<00:02:52.880> has<00:02:53.300> lost<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
so magically the phone has lost the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:26.350 
so magically the phone has lost the
volume<00:03:23.830> amazing<00:03:24.830> isn't<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.310> actually<00:03:26.120> what's

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
volume amazing isn't it actually what's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.110 
volume amazing isn't it actually what's
happening<00:03:26.450> is<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.160> even<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.340> bluetooth<00:03:28.850> is

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
happening is that even the bluetooth is

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.140 
happening is that even the bluetooth is
not<00:03:29.720> able<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.230> penetrate<00:03:30.470> into<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.580> deep

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
not able to penetrate into the deep

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.560 
not able to penetrate into the deep
water<00:03:32.470> if<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:34.160> put<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.610> device<00:03:34.910> inside<00:03:35.390> the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
water if I put the device inside the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.740 
water if I put the device inside the
water<00:03:35.780> for<00:03:36.290> first<00:03:37.100> few<00:03:37.340> inches<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:38.060> Bluetooth

keeps on working but as the device go
further<00:03:41.630> inside<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.290> water<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:43.370> Bluetooth

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
further inside the water the Bluetooth

further inside the water the Bluetooth
cannot<00:03:44.360> work<00:03:44.600> anymore<00:03:44.930> because<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.670> thick

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
cannot work anymore because of the thick

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.199 
cannot work anymore because of the thick
water<00:03:47.390> layer<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.980> guys<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.790> was<00:03:50.030> the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
water layer so guys this was the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.259 
water layer so guys this was the
demonstration<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.380> z2<00:03:51.830> water<00:03:52.269> proofing

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
demonstration of the z2 water proofing

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.539 
demonstration of the z2 water proofing
abilities<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.080> also<00:03:54.230> whether<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.860> can<00:03:55.100> hear
