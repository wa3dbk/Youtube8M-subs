00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
cinched in at the bottom you want it to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.430 
cinched in at the bottom you want it to
go<00:02:10.000> into<00:02:10.300> parallel<00:02:10.720> lines<00:02:10.899> because<00:02:11.290> that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
go into parallel lines because that

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.229 
go into parallel lines because that
means<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.830> everything<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.550> pulling<00:02:12.970> inward
