00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.980
 I think this I do not remember if it comes with 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.320
 the little machine or 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.210
 I do not remember which ones are coming 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.640
 numbering because I have several that are 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.120
 the same so sorry, but it's from 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.190
 same ok of those that fit these are 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.970
 same as those that come in the little machine and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.370
 Well scraper that it is Navajita 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.180
 come here not creation of your I was 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.640
 practicing and it is like that and for 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.210
 take it out , listen to those little buttons 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.210
 crushes him 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 that is well crushed and crushed and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.630
 they jump and they can take it out and they can 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.250
 clean so with acetone a cotton 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 cited 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.950
 and they put it back and this is the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.880
 stamper the stamper can 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.170
 to practice 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.100
 with the image put the varnish well a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 example here 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.860
 and water 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 I tried the scraper and it does not work 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.640
 okay 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 well, it just also did not work for me 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 that does not mean it does not work but 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.409
 they can grab their pattern and see if the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.200
 image looks like this ok if it stays that way 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.149
 do nothing else is perfect 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.159
 I in this case had already sanding it 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.759
 is what you have to do with the lime 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.939
 I made him so bastantito 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.619
 and then what I did is with some 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.610
 wipes to clean your nails 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.700
 I passed the acetone if I saw him I gave him a gift 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.000
 to my sister and another girl and I've seen 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.920
 that mine is harder is like that pink 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.120
 I've seen that my sister's color 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.549
 red then it's like 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.790
 these stampers that are like that 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.069
 chocolates then while well as the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.620
 mine that is hard just with 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.959
 pass the wipe with acetone is 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.430
 well now you can use your image and 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 ready but if this is what then 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.030
 you have to do is leave it gently 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.390
 today my love pass the wipe with 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.000
 acetone like that but just touch it and 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.670
 So do not leave the wipe with acetone 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.140
 because acetone what it does is that it 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.700
 eat this kind of stamp ok like the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.769
 red that I mention if it is the one that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.720
 comes to play ok 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.150
 this little machine comes with a caster 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.069
 similar to this one a carousel like this 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.329
 pebbles because I do not know where I left the one 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:08.209
 it came with the this one comes with this and comes 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.090
 with a pointer like that it makes me 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.329
 alone because this one is two and it's color 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.420
 wood ok I do not know where I left it and 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.950
 can use any enamel and I in 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.270
 this case I will use the crown but 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.900
 can use 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.550
 any enamel can be tested to 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.470
 see which enamels are the ones that 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.140
 they work for you to stamp I'm going to 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.790
 use the clean color one example I think 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.270
 which are six or seven discs go back to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.270
 repeat
