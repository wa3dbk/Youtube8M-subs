luckily the keys were in it and I was
able<00:06:02.590> to<00:06:02.970> turn<00:06:03.970> them<00:06:04.090> on<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.509> put<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:05.050> vehicle

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
able to turn them on and put the vehicle

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.159 
able to turn them on and put the vehicle
into<00:06:05.710> neutral<00:06:06.250> because<00:06:07.180> it<00:06:07.360> wasn't<00:06:07.660> automatic

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
into neutral because it wasn't automatic

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.930 
into neutral because it wasn't automatic
that's<00:06:08.860> kind<00:06:09.069> of<00:06:09.130> a<00:06:09.160> lucky<00:06:09.430> break<00:06:09.550> there<00:06:09.819> on

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.150 
that's kind of a lucky break there on
that<00:06:10.090> one<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:10.479> it<00:06:11.440> was<00:06:11.590> enough<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:11.830> get<00:06:12.009> it

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
that one and it was enough to get it

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.129 
that one and it was enough to get it
rolled<00:06:12.340> out<00:06:12.460> of<00:06:12.520> there<00:06:12.759> slowly<00:06:13.030> you<00:06:13.900> wanna<00:06:14.050> be

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
engage he could do it for short

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.439 
engage he could do it for short
distances<00:06:21.190> though<00:06:21.400> pretty<00:06:21.729> said<00:06:22.030> that<00:06:22.270> most

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
distances though pretty said that most

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
and away from any confrontational

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.029 
and away from any confrontational
situations<00:06:27.789> so<00:06:28.120> we<00:06:28.300> did<00:06:28.509> that<00:06:28.690> we<00:06:29.530> dropped<00:06:29.830> it

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039
