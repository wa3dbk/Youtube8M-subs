00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.780

 they also manage a card game that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.430
 it's called way of life 'I do not know how it 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.810
 pronounces but it is a card game of 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.239
 anime of which I will speak to you in another 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.459
 video and then in front of interim fans 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.860

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.269
 call centers the Latin as 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.450
 enrique plaza on the floor below and 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.099
 cell phones all that but what we 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.349
 matter are the floors above that is 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.780
 where we have articles plus articles from 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.130
 manga and anime and well this plaza del 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.900
 first and second floor have 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.880
 practically the same type of premises 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.470
 that the frick plaza and fun center 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.930
 on the third floor because they were courses of 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.460
 drawing and Japanese I do not remember and until 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.440
 the fourth floor are the most 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.270
 interesting there is a place that has 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.950
 closed game things next there is a 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.540
 out and cosplay and to the right of that 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.240
 local football there is a local that has 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.800
 posters in the background on the fourth floor is 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.780
 where there is a place where they sell manga 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.580
 Spanish history of the Hebrew publishing house 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.370
 and there I buy and you can not even 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.410
 I recommend that they go this place has a 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.880
 good assortment of manga has many 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.240
 titles but what cancer says appreciate 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.070
 guns a very good manga and you do not have 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.960
 many manga titles will have to go 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.570
 to see to ask for three interests 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.700
 I can most likely if it's free what 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.410
 have here is a bit expensive but good 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.230
 I think it's cheaper than going to Spain 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.640
 and get it from there there is another place that 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.560
 it's two streets ahead it had 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.990
 said that it is in the street of uruguay that 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.270
 has a the same thing that freak happens what 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.860
 same as fun center if anything 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.360
 different thing here I leave the page 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.980
 to dry and good if you're from 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.510
 Federal District or the State of Mexico 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.550
 this is going to be that these places do not 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.230
 He tells us neither to visit them, you're going to 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.129
 have a great time even if you do not have money and 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.169
 everything you see there is very beautiful 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.599
 highly recommended good this has 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.419
 been everything has been more a test of 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.649
 audio edition of everything to see if 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.749
 it fits well 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:57.699
 they liked this and subscribe to them 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.289
 like follow me on twitter that is there 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.360

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.050
 here we do not like it to touch and see you 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.050
