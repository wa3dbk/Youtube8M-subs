before<00:02:59.849> that<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.239> think<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:00.750> good<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.110> try

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
before that I think it's good if you try

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.860 
before that I think it's good if you try
the<00:03:02.130> origin<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.730> course<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.299> origin<00:03:03.450> banyan

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the origin of course the origin banyan

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.020 
the origin of course the origin banyan
trees<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.290> then<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.010> execute<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.519> from<00:03:05.819> there

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
trees and then you execute it from there

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.190 
trees and then you execute it from there
all<00:03:06.660> right
