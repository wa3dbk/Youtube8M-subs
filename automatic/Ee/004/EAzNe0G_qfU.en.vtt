about that shield if your people were

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.160 
about that shield if your people were

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.529 
able to have some fun with the shield on
the<00:00:22.260> test<00:00:22.500> range<00:00:22.830> by<00:00:23.160> modifying<00:00:23.640> their<00:00:24.090> client

protection this is something a lot of
people<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> community<00:01:05.939> were<00:01:06.150> concerned

people in the community were concerned

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
people in the community were concerned
about<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.560> first<00:01:07.590> heard<00:01:08.070> about<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
about when they first heard about this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.390 
about when they first heard about this
shield<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.290> switch<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.189> just

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
shield so if you switch to it it just

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
shield so if you switch to it it just
pops<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.320> other<00:01:13.470> things<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
pops up like all the other things you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.460 
pops up like all the other things you
can<00:01:14.250> carry<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.970> an<00:01:15.180> idea<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.930> had<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
can carry with you an idea I had when I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.460 
can carry with you an idea I had when I
first<00:01:16.590> heard<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.850> shield<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
first heard about this shield was that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
first heard about this shield was that
maybe<00:01:19.979> my<00:01:20.310> teammates<00:01:20.790> could<00:01:21.030> jump<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
maybe my teammates could jump on it and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
maybe my teammates could jump on it and
that<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.710> reach<00:01:23.009> an<00:01:23.250> area<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that they reach an area that is

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
that they reach an area that is
otherwise<00:01:24.240> hard<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.840> reach<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.280> could

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
otherwise hard to reach so this could

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850 
otherwise hard to reach so this could
add<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> nice<00:01:27.000> tactical<00:01:27.630> element<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.680> on

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
add a nice tactical element because on

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
add a nice tactical element because on
some<00:01:29.070> maps<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.820> team<00:01:30.060> could<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.509> flank<00:01:30.930> in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
some maps your team could then flank in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
some maps your team could then flank in
ways<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.740> could<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.070> before<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.509> can't

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
ways they could not before but you can't

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.950 
ways they could not before but you can't
jump<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.560> easily<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.729> seems<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
jump on it that easily it seems that the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.050 
jump on it that easily it seems that the
player<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:38.040> falling<00:01:38.579> through<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
player is actually falling through the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
player is actually falling through the
shield<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:40.049> top<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.530> player<00:01:40.799> who's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
shield and on top of the player who's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
shield and on top of the player who's
holding<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.320> think<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> would<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
holding it I think that it would be a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
holding it I think that it would be a
great<00:01:44.280> feature<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.420> could<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:45.960> stand

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
great feature if you could really stand

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.310 
great feature if you could really stand
on<00:01:46.680> top<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> shield<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> ballistic

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
on top of the shield so the ballistic

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.550 
on top of the shield so the ballistic
shield<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.740> primarily<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.460> defensive<00:01:51.270> weapon

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
shield is primarily a defensive weapon

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.539 
shield is primarily a defensive weapon
however<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.770> also<00:01:53.189> hit<00:01:53.579> other<00:01:53.909> players

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549

if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.790> hit<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.210> then<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> takes<00:01:58.350> away

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
if you hit one then this takes away

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.249 
if you hit one then this takes away
forty-five<00:01:59.219> percent<00:01:59.520> of<00:02:00.000> his<00:02:00.180> health<00:02:00.509> before

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
today's patch in the CTE you could kill

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.569 
today's patch in the CTE you could kill
another<00:02:04.020> player<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.159> hit<00:02:05.369> from

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
another player with just one hit from

the<00:02:05.700> ballistic<00:02:06.240> shield<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.689> maps<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.740> locker

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the ballistic shield on maps like locker

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.729 
the ballistic shield on maps like locker
this<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.729> quite<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.090> lot<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.360> fun<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.379> could<00:02:10.530> go

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this was quite a lot of fun you could go

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.920 
this was quite a lot of fun you could go
on<00:02:10.920> kill<00:02:11.220> streaks<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:11.849> even<00:02:12.209> do<00:02:12.330> multi<00:02:12.720> kills

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
on kill streaks or even do multi kills

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.520 
on kill streaks or even do multi kills
with

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
with

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.120 
with
shield<00:02:13.760> however<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> gameplay<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:16.770> was

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
shield however for the gameplay this was

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.059 
shield however for the gameplay this was
not<00:02:17.370> very<00:02:17.520> good<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.560> changes

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
not very good so I do like the changes

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.120 
not very good so I do like the changes
dies<00:02:20.310> did<00:02:20.640> today<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> patch<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.890> when<00:02:23.040> you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
dies did today in the patch so when you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.400 
dies did today in the patch so when you
see<00:02:23.340> someone<00:02:23.670> storming<00:02:24.450> right<00:02:24.660> at<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.380> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
see someone storming right at you with a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.830 
see someone storming right at you with a
ballistic<00:02:25.950> shield<00:02:26.190> your<00:02:26.760> first<00:02:27.030> instinct

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
ballistic shield your first instinct

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.110 
ballistic shield your first instinct
might<00:02:27.990> be<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.260> try<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.650> shoot<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.250> glass<00:02:35.120> I'd

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
might be to try and shoot the glass I'd

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.330 
might be to try and shoot the glass I'd
recommend<00:02:36.569> if<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.230> take<00:02:37.470> his<00:02:37.650> feet<00:02:40.250> when<00:02:41.250> you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
recommend if you take his feet when you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.130 
recommend if you take his feet when you
crouch<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.330> shield<00:02:42.600> will<00:02:42.840> touch<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
crouch then the shield will touch the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.960 
crouch then the shield will touch the
ground<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.890> your<00:02:44.280> feet<00:02:44.459> are<00:02:44.489> no<00:02:44.730> longer

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
ground and your feet are no longer

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.210 
ground and your feet are no longer
exposed<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:46.350> will<00:02:46.500> make<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.830> even<00:02:46.920> harder

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
exposed this will make it even harder

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:56.479 
exposed this will make it even harder
for<00:02:47.400> other<00:02:47.580> players<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.330> take<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.750> out<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:56.459> a

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
for other players to take you out but a

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.199 
for other players to take you out but a
grenade<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:57.180> fix<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.660> very<00:02:57.930> easily<00:03:02.209> now

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
grenade can fix this very easily now

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.449 
grenade can fix this very easily now
let's<00:03:03.420> test<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.750> few<00:03:03.780> other<00:03:04.110> things<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.769> example

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
let's test a few other things in example

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.090 
let's test a few other things in example
and<00:03:05.640> rocket<00:03:06.269> launcher<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:10.410> my<00:03:10.560> health<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.950> now

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
and rocket launcher so my health is now

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.220 
and rocket launcher so my health is now
down<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.730> twenty<00:03:12.209> nine<00:03:12.360> percent<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.019> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
down to twenty nine percent and the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.470 
down to twenty nine percent and the
glass<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.620> broken<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.580> means<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.000> my<00:03:15.300> head

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
glass is broken this means that my head

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:28.510 
glass is broken this means that my head
is<00:03:15.510> exposed<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.350> now<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> can<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.310> shot

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.760 

now<00:03:29.180> let's<00:03:29.390> see<00:03:29.540> how<00:03:29.690> much<00:03:29.840> damage<00:03:30.110> one<00:03:30.500> shot

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
now let's see how much damage one shot

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.660 
now let's see how much damage one shot
from<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.310> gun<00:03:31.520> of<00:03:31.550> an<00:03:31.880> tank<00:03:32.180> can<00:03:32.480> do<00:03:33.670> destroys

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
from the gun of an tank can do destroys

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.180 
from the gun of an tank can do destroys
the<00:03:34.850> glass<00:03:35.030> with<00:03:35.300> one<00:03:35.540> shot<00:03:35.810> but<00:03:36.800> there's<00:03:37.040> no

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
the glass with one shot but there's no

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.670 
the glass with one shot but there's no
damage<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.820> player<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:41.470> directed<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
damage to the player a directed that the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.830 
damage to the player a directed that the
tank<00:03:43.040> shell<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.550> too<00:03:43.970> much<00:03:44.120> for<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.420> ballistic

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
tank shell is too much for the ballistic

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.570 
tank shell is too much for the ballistic
sheet<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.580> see<00:03:46.850> for<00:03:51.100> one<00:03:52.100> direct<00:03:52.490> hit

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
sheet and so is see for one direct hit

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.430 
sheet and so is see for one direct hit
with<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:53.060> grenade<00:03:53.420> launcher<00:03:53.840> destroys<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
with the grenade launcher destroys the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.860 
with the grenade launcher destroys the
glass<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.920> thus<00:03:55.430> fifty-five<00:03:56.120> percent<00:03:56.390> damage

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
glass and thus fifty-five percent damage

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:07.390 
glass and thus fifty-five percent damage
a<00:04:04.060> pickup<00:04:05.060> weapon<00:04:05.390> like<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> mr2<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.770> able

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
a pickup weapon like the a mr2 is able

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.460 
a pickup weapon like the a mr2 is able
to<00:04:07.550> shoot<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:08.030> glass<00:04:08.150> but<00:04:08.870> there's<00:04:09.110> no<00:04:09.230> damage

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
to shoot the glass but there's no damage

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.670 
to shoot the glass but there's no damage
to<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.800> player<00:04:10.100> behind<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:11.230> one<00:04:12.230> shot<00:04:12.470> out<00:04:12.650> of

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
to the player behind it one shot out of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.740 
to the player behind it one shot out of
an<00:04:12.890> air<00:04:13.100> burst<00:04:13.280> destroys<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:14.030> glass<00:04:14.240> and<00:04:14.480> does

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
an air burst destroys the glass and does

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.100 
an air burst destroys the glass and does
twenty<00:04:15.170> percent<00:04:15.440> damage<00:04:15.710> to<00:04:16.130> my<00:04:16.280> health<00:04:17.110> so

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
twenty percent damage to my health so

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.870 
twenty percent damage to my health so
that's<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.500> ballistic<00:04:18.950> shield<00:04:19.280> as<00:04:19.520> it<00:04:19.580> is

ballistic shield makes the most sense a

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.290 
ballistic shield makes the most sense a
metro<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.380> locker<00:04:36.620> but<00:04:37.520> with<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.880> amount<00:04:37.970> of

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
Natesville made explosives you see in

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.160 
Natesville made explosives you see in
those<00:04:40.310> maps<00:04:40.640> I'm<00:04:40.970> not<00:04:41.420> sure<00:04:41.480> if<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.870> lot<00:04:42.050> of

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
those maps I'm not sure if a lot of

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.020 
those maps I'm not sure if a lot of
people<00:04:42.560> will<00:04:42.680> actually<00:04:42.950> take<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.670> in<00:04:43.820> their

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
people will actually take it in their

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.450 
people will actually take it in their
loadout<00:04:44.420> sure<00:04:45.080> everyone<00:04:45.560> will<00:04:45.740> try<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.130> out<00:04:46.310> in

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
loadout sure everyone will try it out in

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.580 
loadout sure everyone will try it out in
the<00:04:46.490> beginning<00:04:46.910> but<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.870> like<00:04:47.990> in<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.410> air

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
the beginning but just like in the air

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.910 
the beginning but just like in the air
mines<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.250> UK<00:04:49.700> fan<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.060> UAV<00:04:50.570> i<00:04:50.780> think<00:04:51.650> that

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
mines the UK fan the UAV i think that

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.890 
mines the UK fan the UAV i think that
the<00:04:52.040> shield<00:04:52.280> will<00:04:52.520> just<00:04:52.820> disappear<00:04:52.970> from<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
the shield will just disappear from the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.750 
the shield will just disappear from the
loadouts<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.650> players<00:04:55.010> after<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.520> few

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
loadouts of the players after a few

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.690 
loadouts of the players after a few
weeks<00:04:56.170> so<00:04:57.170> right<00:04:57.380> now<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:58.220> don't<00:04:58.430> need<00:04:58.640> to

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
weeks so right now you don't need to

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.450 
weeks so right now you don't need to
feel<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.240> shield<00:04:59.590> but<00:05:00.590> i<00:05:00.620> think<00:05:00.770> that<00:05:01.130> the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
feel the shield but i think that the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.280 
feel the shield but i think that the
shield<00:05:01.700> could<00:05:01.880> actually<00:05:02.120> make<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.810> gameplay

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
shield could actually make the gameplay

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.640 
shield could actually make the gameplay
more<00:05:03.530> fun<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.730> dice<00:05:05.210> la<00:05:05.600> should<00:05:05.900> try<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.410> tweak

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
more fun so dice la should try and tweak

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.800 
more fun so dice la should try and tweak
it<00:05:06.800> further<00:05:07.070> do<00:05:07.610> not<00:05:07.820> do<00:05:08.090> this<00:05:08.120> to<00:05:08.600> another

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
it further do not do this to another

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.100 
it further do not do this to another
gadget<00:05:09.350> no<00:05:09.920> one<00:05:10.160> uses<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:11.450> after<00:05:11.780> this<00:05:11.870> patch

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
gadget no one uses so after this patch

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.000 
gadget no one uses so after this patch
today<00:05:12.380> in<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.040> CTE<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.610> few<00:05:14.000> players<00:05:14.270> are<00:05:14.630> now

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
today in the CTE a few players are now

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.380 
today in the CTE a few players are now
complaining<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.669> shield<00:05:17.000> can<00:05:17.240> no

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
complaining that the shield can no

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.540 
complaining that the shield can no
longer<00:05:17.630> kill<00:05:17.960> em<00:05:18.110> player<00:05:18.350> with<00:05:18.680> just<00:05:19.070> one<00:05:19.310> hit

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
longer kill em player with just one hit

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.120 
longer kill em player with just one hit
but<00:05:20.360> in<00:05:20.510> my<00:05:20.630> opinion<00:05:20.780> this<00:05:21.230> was<00:05:21.290> a<00:05:21.470> good<00:05:21.770> change

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
but in my opinion this was a good change

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.040 
but in my opinion this was a good change
and<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:23.150> would<00:05:23.300> not<00:05:23.450> give<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.780> any<00:05:23.960> more

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
and I would not give it any more

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.650 
and I would not give it any more
offensive<00:05:24.800> capabilities<00:05:25.550> like<00:05:25.790> allowing

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
offensive capabilities like allowing

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.840 
offensive capabilities like allowing
that<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:27.080> can<00:05:27.320> use<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.890> shield<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.460> pistol

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
that you can use the shield and a pistol

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.540 
that you can use the shield and a pistol
at<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.060> same<00:05:29.300> time<00:05:29.600> as<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.620> really<00:05:30.830> has<00:05:31.160> to<00:05:31.190> be

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
at the same time as it really has to be

at the same time as it really has to be
a<00:05:31.580> defensive<00:05:32.419> gadget<00:05:32.960> only<00:05:33.380> I<00:05:33.620> would<00:05:34.400> give<00:05:34.580> it

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
a defensive gadget only I would give it

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.180 
a defensive gadget only I would give it
the<00:05:34.850> ability<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:35.630> have<00:05:35.660> my<00:05:36.140> teammates<00:05:36.680> jump<00:05:37.040> on

the ability to have my teammates jump on

the ability to have my teammates jump on
it<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.460> reach<00:05:37.940> another<00:05:38.240> area<00:05:38.690> of<00:05:38.750> the

it and reach another area of the

it and reach another area of the
map<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.449> way<00:05:39.630> so<00:05:40.199> they<00:05:40.260> can<00:05:40.470> flank<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:41.070> other

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190

explosions damage the shield and that it

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.960 
explosions damage the shield and that it

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
getting me killed behind it maybe even

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.180 
getting me killed behind it maybe even
use<00:06:06.510> a<00:06:06.540> bit<00:06:06.780> more<00:06:06.960> microts<00:06:07.410> traction<00:06:07.949> on<00:06:08.070> the

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
use a bit more microts traction on the

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.520 
use a bit more microts traction on the

the<00:06:10.650> HS<00:06:11.150> dice<00:06:12.150> might<00:06:12.419> even<00:06:12.660> design<00:06:13.080> it<00:06:13.260> in<00:06:13.350> a

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
the HS dice might even design it in a

the HS dice might even design it in a
way<00:06:13.650> that<00:06:13.680> drivers<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:14.550> LMGs<00:06:15.030> can<00:06:15.450> damage<00:06:15.840> it

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
way that drivers and LMGs can damage it

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.159 
way that drivers and LMGs can damage it
as<00:06:16.200> well<00:06:16.470> but<00:06:17.130> only<00:06:17.430> little<00:06:17.669> damage<00:06:18.030> so<00:06:18.930> that

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
as well but only little damage so that

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.530 
as well but only little damage so that
it<00:06:19.320> needs<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.740> lot<00:06:20.010> of<00:06:20.070> rounds<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:20.760> destroy<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:21.330> I

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
it needs a lot of rounds to destroy it I

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.840 
it needs a lot of rounds to destroy it I
think<00:06:22.440> that<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.680> ballistic<00:06:23.220> shield<00:06:23.490> has<00:06:23.729> the

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
think that a ballistic shield has the

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.150 
think that a ballistic shield has the
potential<00:06:24.210> to<00:06:24.450> improve<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:25.080> gameplay<00:06:25.530> but

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
potential to improve the gameplay but

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.400 
potential to improve the gameplay but
not<00:06:26.490> in<00:06:26.610> its<00:06:26.760> current<00:06:27.000> design<00:06:27.540> I<00:06:27.810> hope<00:06:28.260> that

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
not in its current design I hope that

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.260 
not in its current design I hope that
dice<00:06:28.620> continues<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.340> tweak<00:06:29.610> it<00:06:29.760> further<00:06:30.060> and

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
dice continues to tweak it further and

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.870 
dice continues to tweak it further and
that<00:06:30.360> we<00:06:30.690> get<00:06:30.840> a<00:06:30.870> gadget<00:06:31.139> from<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.740> DLC<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.760> is

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
that we get a gadget from a DLC that is

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.040 
that we get a gadget from a DLC that is
actually<00:06:33.419> used<00:06:33.690> more<00:06:34.050> than<00:06:34.080> just<00:06:34.470> a<00:06:34.620> few<00:06:34.800> weeks
