00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello how about friends how are you doing now 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.770
 I bring you a video of a plant 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.500
 which is considered a superfood are 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.230
 some pretty small seeds that do not 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.690
 they have almost flavor but they are 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.609
 quite useful and lately some 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.650
 studies classify it as a 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.930
 Superfood by characteristics 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 specials that you have start then 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 with a quick review of the seeds 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.769
 of chia the benefits and how we can 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.349
 consume them this plant belongs to the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.300
 mint families or mine already 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 much cultivated in southern Mexico's 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.800
 first consumers were the Aztecs 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.450
 and Mayans in pre-Columbian times 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 highlighting therefore the word chÃ­a whose 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.969
 meaning is force when submerged 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.399
 in water these seeds absorb several 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.200
 times its weight in water forming a type 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.420
 of helmuth and the gi no so what gives the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.969
 feeling of satiety when consuming them 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.489
 This gel is made of pretty fiber 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.579
 soluble and I can assure you that by taking 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.850
 only a teaspoon in the morning go 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.159
 to have an almost immediate society as 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 We can consume these seeds 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.850
 can consume by mixing 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.000
 with water as I said or some food 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.430
 liquid for example yogurt milk or juice 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.350
 citrus especially you can also 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 add desserts or salads 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.240
 ingest the areas the ideal portions 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.770
 is adding a glass of water 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 teaspoon of seeds i them 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.760
 I recommend that you start with a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 small teaspoon to two or three 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.040
 days already with a spoonful a little bit more 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.229
 large these are left to rest for a while and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.120
 you can drink the water with all the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 seeds now also these seeds are 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.440
 they are using in food supplements 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.780
 and also in bakery now the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.270
 Properties in 100 grams of seeds 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.580
 that we can find we can find 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.590
 twice as much protein as in other 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.700
 seeds with all the amino acids 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 essentials 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 those amino acids that our body 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.540
 produces five times the calcium of the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 breast milk also has boron that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.200
 helps the absorption of calcium in 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.479
 our bones have twice as much 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.490
 potassium than bananas three times more 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.190
 antioxidants than three blueberries 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.619
 times more iron than spinach acids 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.650
 omega 3 essential fatty acids and it is also 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.950
 an excellent source of magnesium 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.719
 copper zinc and other vitamins 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.939
 besides the important fiber 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.159
 soluble these seeds have the 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.400
 ability to slow down the conversion 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.599
 of carbohydrates in simple sugars 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.700
 controlling in some way the levels 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.680
 of blood sugar this very good 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.810
 for diabetic people the high degree of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.760
 antioxidants makes the seeds do not 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 deteriorate or get in rne without 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.079
 can be stored for up to 4 years in 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.120
 low humidity conditions the 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.129
 same antioxidants that they have for 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.319
 avoid such harmful free radicals 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.269
 that damage the cells and make us 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.609
 age now he detailed the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.200
 provide benefits quickly 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.970
 energy and they increase the strength and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.159
 resistance the chia is one of the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.650
 protein sources completely from 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.579
 higher plant origin regulate the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.950
 blood sugar levels 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.750
 retarding the process by which 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.340
 digestive enzyme break down the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.769
 carbohydrates or carbohydrates 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.569
 and turn them into sugars after 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.090
 the meals especially if you eat 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.560
 starchy foods or sugars we can 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.540
 get to feel tired and without 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.609
 energy by balancing the sugar in the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.630
 blood we not only reduce the risk of 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.580
 type 2 diabetes 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.590
 but we also guarantee a 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.840
 constant energy throughout the day it 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.970
 Add diaz to your food will help you 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.250
 avoid the ups and downs of sugar 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.980
 in the blood and regulates therefore the 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.290
 insulin helps in weight loss since 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.850
 that the seeds and their gelling action 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.980
 maintain the feeling of fullness 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.960
 for hours on diets 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.240
 thinning should consult 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.910
 always with health professionals 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.370
 qualified favors or regulates the function 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.950
 intestinal sweeping literally to 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.420
 through the intestinal tract thanks to 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.340
 the soluble fiber that contains 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.710
 dissolving and eliminating garbage 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.540
 accumulated in the intestines many 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.340
 people are found to be in their stools 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.440
 they also become more regular 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.240
 Soluble fiber and gel coating 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.120
 of the seeds keep the colon 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.130
 hydrated and ensures easy movement 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.200
 of food these seeds does not have 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.810
 gluten which makes it suitable for coeliacs 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.510
 chia seeds also for their 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.230
 omega 3 magnesium and calcium oils are from 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.030
 very good help in any treatment 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.000
 anti-inflammatory 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.230

 also try to consume this kind of 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.870
 seeds in a personal way I already 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.450
 I'm doing and the results have been 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.040
 quite favorable the immediate action 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.710
