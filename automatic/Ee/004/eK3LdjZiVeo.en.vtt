00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:16.119
 The other I kinda grayed when I got the story of a large dictionary 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:18.060
 In fact, with the head saying that it does business, there is no plan in oneself, saying that it is not interesting 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.760
 I'm sorry 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:27.640
 Well from the story that I say Hugh Jackman lover role like 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.480
 Then I might have been a fan of great Yu who started with imprudent motives what I want to do 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.300
 There 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.470
 Well, I don't know if I really want to do something myself 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.550
 Cane Well Nde 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.800
 When I met James Mangold Director 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.940
 Monoa say the first time you play 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.090
 To the experience to wind Tteyuu also I want my absolute this is to do 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.800
 Went feelings changed 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.470
 So after all 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:58.370
 Well when I heard that it was decided to audition 3 times and decided 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:02.840
 Something actually a little bit the last combat to was happy 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.020
 I was relieved because I had a good response, but I will go through it again from there 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.740
 But this or went on behalf of such anxiety as that it would be nice if to from I was in 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.790
 Also 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.480
 Final audition is Hugh Jackman 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.800
 That the in New York 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.580
 It was a read but it was Hugh's intention 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.810
 And saying to Fu say I want to do ad-lib 0 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.810
 For the first time in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:32.039
 Like a please forget it though I have said in the full fine to remember the other serif ad lib 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.830
 In getting the Fu Tteyuu I wish it looks like What Te Fair up Bukkake 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:43.320
 He is really that I'd have done puzzled another amazing 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:47.430
 Something in that to us by inducing but I was carried out much Well that struck 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.810
 I say I wonder what kind of character I myself for the first time 10 of character 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.680
 This the place 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:59.740
 Me the government of the opportunity Hugh say to think thorough investigation 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:05.030
 What do from that time to the place that actually had been glued to the other really words Te 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:09.649
 What like a Mariko is in place Tteyuu wonder seeking What is Mariko 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.780
 That one's feeling went into very deep for the first time and polo came out at that time 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.370
 I am ordinary 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:24.269
 I said something like that I want life but after that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:27.150
 It is also to kiss that I from the direction of the skin but I was not in the script whether it is giving me saddle 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.640
 That's about it 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:35.980
 And then 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:41.590
 Director does not know what a little Well happened Te Yuyuma Yuma I cut 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:46.780
 I could not believe that in a wind like I had kissed with Hugh Jackman 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.560
 But the staff members who were trashing at that time were so impressed 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.360
 Please tell me 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.710
 Well also something my own 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.690
 Let's do something so fun that it makes no sense 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.940
 Because it came in audition 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.740
 It is tan to imagine I Naa would be nice people but the other really Te imagine 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.580
 Yeah or insects rather than you think 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.850
 I really think that this is not the case 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:18.120
 Not a perfect person 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.460
 It's really great as an actor, but it's really a human being as that other person 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.570
 Can be respected 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:30.480
 That's my first time acting in form 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:36.650
 Having been able to start the career with him what the play is with him 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:39.450
 Is amazing set higher ones Tteyuu really is an honor Sinan if your standard 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:46.230
 I think the Fu that I wish I 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:51.720
 Emotion Just because Well management is anyway collapse when the first director and readability of the rear 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:54.569
 I was also forget to put out Motas's like I mean went to they do not know be what do you want 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:02.879
 In refracted heroine 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:08.670
 Imagine if you grow up as an ordinary girl who grew up in Japan's richest family 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:14.040
 The place where I would not have come would overlap with my little seriousness 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.590
 Somehow there is or I'd I was a little much that is complex is tall 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.579
 Why 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.790
 Like I say Na wonder different from 2 Tsuano other children 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:28.020
 It's a really good question or something 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:32.819
 It will have part went a little reflected in the Maiko while remembering those that say natto 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:39.629
 I myself started to work Tteyuu that Well also leave 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:42.030
 I think positively about things such as my height or being too thin 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:46.300
 It is as well because now is to 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.889
 It sounds like it sounds good to be born in a woman 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.950
 Now 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:55.920
 I think this 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:05:00.240
 I'm giving birth like a sloppy, but my grandfather is so good this niece 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:04.259
 We met eh O and Well Wolverine in the middle of war 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.669
 How wonderful and fascinating he is 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:12.330
 I say I'm me surely protect Mariko me observe the Well yourself 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:15.330
 Well that from the place Tatte grew up hearing is to 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:20.310
 I will always be myself 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:24.440
 The hero who I thought was only in the story appeared in front of my eyes 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:30.830
 Besides, they protect me 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:36.560
 And well brackets that I'd think well not is pretty girls do not fall in love 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:40.280
 Furthermore she has a very different life from that person 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.020
 With the part that you fall in the ordinary life 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:51.830
 The Marlow version is mutant and not human 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:53.150
 I think that it might have resonated with the people who carried such fate 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.620
 I will 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.249
 The Well uh action I Oh really Hua 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.899
 A little compared to other people 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:10.629
 In the really myself but I'd feel say who stood guests to participate waterfall 

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:15.020
 It was a first time experience, so it was a great challenge and my body is like this 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:23.120
 It was also a good opportunity for me to know how to move. 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:26.270
 That's where it became hard , right, remember that both Japanese and English and oversee it on the spot 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:31.550
 Then I went to Japan from now , which was English from now 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:35.009
 It changed the way more and more earth-moving request Fu say Toka doing in the mix is really up to the 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.939
 I have to learn in two languages ​​in the first place because I will go 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.139
 It is quite good that you have to switch on the spot where you have to learn English 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:43.560
 that 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:50.100
 It was quite a challenge but 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:56.390
 Anyway, it 's really a lot of fun and I'm going to be with you for months and something with the same team 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:57.500
 I am say make up make things I feel something most attractive 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:02.420
 that 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:05.340
 The feeling of being one of the creations is something 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.800
 It was the most happy of 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:14.409
 It is everybody Hello head of visit Cinema g 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:19.750

 Then, when has become the Japan of wintering Hollywood movie that did not take toilet only in Hollywood 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:26.080
