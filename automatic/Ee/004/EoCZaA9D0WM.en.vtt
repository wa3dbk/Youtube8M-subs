they<00:00:34.380> discharged<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.190> there's<00:00:35.610> some

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
they discharged because there's some

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.709 
they discharged because there's some

batteries down to empty it's actually a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.020 
batteries down to empty it's actually a
good<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.500> normally<00:00:46.950> keep<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.460> rav4<00:00:47.789> EV

at twenty or thirty or forty percent
full<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:52.140> only<00:00:52.289> charge<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.770> up<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.430> full

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
full and we only charge it up to full

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.889 
full and we only charge it up to full
when<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.090> actually<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> go<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> long

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.819 
when we actually have to go a long
distance<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.109> plug-in<00:00:58.109> serial<00:00:58.440> hybrid<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
distance so the plug-in serial hybrid is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.959 
distance so the plug-in serial hybrid is
perfect<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.489> nickel<00:00:59.730> metal<00:00:59.879> hydride

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
cold problem they don't like heat too

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
cold problem they don't like heat too
much<00:01:12.689> heat<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.500> hurt<00:01:13.650> them<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
much heat can actually hurt them and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
much heat can actually hurt them and
when<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> fully<00:01:14.700> charged<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:15.420> there's<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
when you fully charged them there's a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
when you fully charged them there's a
discharge<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:17.009> heat<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.270> ambient

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
discharge with heat so if the ambient

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.120 
discharge with heat so if the ambient
temperature<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.290> hot<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.860> actually

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
temperature is too hot you can actually

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
temperature is too hot you can actually
damage<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> batteries<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.750> heat<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
damage the batteries so heat is the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
damage the batteries so heat is the

actually<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.780> heat<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.320> want<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually don't want heat you want to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
actually don't want heat you want to
keep<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.950> cold<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.909> want<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> keep<00:01:39.329> them

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.760 
the Volt with nickel batteries you you
want<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> batteries<00:01:54.600> run<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:54.869> so

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
want to have the batteries run down so

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.249 
want to have the batteries run down so
that<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.250> absorb<00:01:56.610> some<00:01:57.259> regenerative

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that you can absorb some regenerative

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.120 
that you can absorb some regenerative
braking<00:01:58.649> power<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.390> the<00:02:00.710> engine<00:02:01.710> generator

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
braking power and the engine generator

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.720 
braking power and the engine generator
when<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> batteries<00:02:03.390> ran<00:02:03.570> down<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:04.200> those<00:02:04.290> few

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
when it batteries ran down on those few

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.510 
when it batteries ran down on those few
occasions<00:02:05.150> would<00:02:05.810> put<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.410> energy<00:02:06.560> back<00:02:07.100> into

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
occasions would put the energy back into

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.280 
occasions would put the energy back into
the<00:02:07.670> regenerative<00:02:08.240> braking<00:02:08.630> shot<00:02:08.870> would

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
the regenerative braking shot would

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.740 
the regenerative braking shot would
either<00:02:09.410> charge<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.130> batteries<00:02:10.610> or<00:02:10.910> if<00:02:11.540> there

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
either charge the batteries or if there

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.330 
either charge the batteries or if there
were<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.080> lot<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.530> regenerative<00:02:12.950> braking<00:02:13.280> at

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
were a lot of regenerative braking at

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.010 
were a lot of regenerative braking at
the<00:02:13.400> same<00:02:13.580> time<00:02:13.820> or<00:02:14.330> just<00:02:14.360> run<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.840> car

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the same time or just run the car

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.110 
the same time or just run the car
directly<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.340> batteries<00:02:16.700> would<00:02:16.850> stay

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
directly and the batteries would stay

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.030 
directly and the batteries would stay
depleted<00:02:17.720> until<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.380> came<00:02:18.560> back<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
depleted until you came back to the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.130 
depleted until you came back to the
house<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.520> charged<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.330> your<00:02:20.510> solar<00:02:20.720> system

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
house and charged on your solar system

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.740 
house and charged on your solar system
all<00:02:21.260> over<00:02:21.500> again
