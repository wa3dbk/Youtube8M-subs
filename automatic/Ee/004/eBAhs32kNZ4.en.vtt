00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
now here's a bit of a demo on how to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.350 
now here's a bit of a demo on how to
paint<00:00:08.840> a<00:00:08.959> timber<00:00:09.619> ceiling<00:00:10.119> and<00:00:11.119> one<00:00:11.240> of<00:00:11.299> the

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
paint a timber ceiling and one of the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.850 
paint a timber ceiling and one of the
first<00:00:11.480> things<00:00:11.780> you<00:00:11.840> want<00:00:11.930> to<00:00:12.019> do

first things you want to do

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.179 
first things you want to do
parallel<00:00:14.750> now<00:00:15.110> when<00:00:15.320> preparing<00:00:15.679> the<00:00:15.799> ceiling

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
parallel now when preparing the ceiling

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.589 
parallel now when preparing the ceiling
one<00:00:16.580> thing<00:00:16.760> you<00:00:16.820> want<00:00:16.939> to<00:00:16.970> make<00:00:17.119> sure<00:00:17.150> you<00:00:17.420> do

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
one thing you want to make sure you do

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.569 
one thing you want to make sure you do
is<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.939> caulk<00:00:19.939> all<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.449> gaps<00:00:20.770> but<00:00:21.770> do<00:00:22.220> not<00:00:22.369> put

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
is to caulk all the gaps but do not put

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.310 
is to caulk all the gaps but do not put
too<00:00:22.789> much<00:00:22.939> in<00:00:23.150> there<00:00:23.180> you<00:00:23.720> only<00:00:23.869> just<00:00:24.020> want<00:00:24.200> to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
too much in there you only just want to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.850 
too much in there you only just want to
fill<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.369> gap<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:25.730> that's<00:00:25.880> it<00:00:26.060> I<00:00:26.560> have<00:00:27.560> seen

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
fill the gap and that's it I have seen

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.709 
fill the gap and that's it I have seen
some<00:00:28.130> people<00:00:28.369> do<00:00:28.669> it<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:28.969> they<00:00:29.239> actually<00:00:29.390> put

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:29.719 
some people do it and they actually put

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.350 
some people do it and they actually put
too<00:00:29.899> much<00:00:30.079> caulking<00:00:30.890> in<00:00:31.009> there<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:32.300> start

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
too much caulking in there and you start

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.940 
too much caulking in there and you start
losing<00:00:32.719> all<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.079> definition<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.710> all<00:00:33.829> the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
losing all the definition of all the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.790 
losing all the definition of all the
joins<00:00:34.219> which<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:34.670> don't<00:00:34.850> really<00:00:35.000> want<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.239> do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
joins which you don't really want to do

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.520 
joins which you don't really want to do
so<00:00:36.800> firstly<00:00:37.370> go<00:00:37.610> through<00:00:37.850> give<00:00:38.059> it<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.210> sand

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
so firstly go through give it a sand

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.790 
so firstly go through give it a sand
caulk<00:00:39.530> all<00:00:39.710> your<00:00:39.860> gaps<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.649> then<00:00:42.649> you're

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
caulk all your gaps and then you're

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.060 
caulk all your gaps and then you're
pretty<00:00:42.980> much<00:00:43.100> ready<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.460> paint<00:00:44.149> it<00:00:44.860> so<00:00:45.860> when

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
pretty much ready to paint it so when

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.260 
pretty much ready to paint it so when
you're<00:00:46.130> painting<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.520> ceiling<00:00:46.730> lock<00:00:46.970> this<00:00:47.090> one

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
you're painting a ceiling lock this one

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.030 
you're painting a ceiling lock this one
of<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.390> easiest<00:00:47.720> ways<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:47.990> to<00:00:48.470> actually<00:00:48.650> brush

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
of the easiest ways is to actually brush

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.680 
of the easiest ways is to actually brush
and<00:00:50.200> use<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.230> roller<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:52.239> paint<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.390> way

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
and use a roller and paint it that way

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.900 
and use a roller and paint it that way
so<00:00:54.680> all<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:54.920> actually<00:00:54.980> do<00:00:55.310> is<00:00:55.579> I'm<00:00:55.730> going<00:00:55.850> to

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
so all we actually do is I'm going to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.270 
so all we actually do is I'm going to
cut<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.239> cut<00:00:57.200> it<00:00:57.320> in<00:00:57.440> first<00:00:57.770> and<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:01.190> only

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
cut the cut it in first and I'm only

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.380 
cut the cut it in first and I'm only
going<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.489> do<00:01:02.290> four<00:01:03.290> boards<00:01:03.680> at<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.890> time<00:01:04.390> three

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
going to do four boards at a time three

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.460 
going to do four boards at a time three
or<00:01:05.420> four<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:05.869> probably<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.229> good<00:01:06.350> amount<00:01:08.470> now

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
or four is probably a good amount now

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.679 
or four is probably a good amount now
that<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:09.710> cut<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.210> we're<00:01:11.210> actually<00:01:11.390> going<00:01:11.600> to

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
that it's cut in we're actually going to

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.050 
that it's cut in we're actually going to
roll<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.990> boards<00:01:12.579> now<00:01:13.579> when<00:01:13.790> you're<00:01:13.909> rolling

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
roll the boards now when you're rolling

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.330 
roll the boards now when you're rolling
yes<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:14.659> want<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.869> roll<00:01:15.049> across<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:16.100> grain

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
yes you want to roll across the grain

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.090 
yes you want to roll across the grain
basically<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.930> idea<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.650> where<00:01:18.979> as

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
basically the idea of this is where as

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.740 
basically the idea of this is where as
you're<00:01:19.250> rolling<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.790> going<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.060> force<00:01:20.330> paint

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
you're rolling is going to force paint

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.350 
you're rolling is going to force paint
into<00:01:21.080> all<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.320> joints<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.940> help<00:01:22.940> form<00:01:23.240> up<00:01:23.330> for

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
into all the joints and help form up for

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.640 
into all the joints and help form up for
you<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.720> little<00:01:23.810> bit

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:43.000 

make<00:01:33.650> sure<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.010> use<00:01:34.130> plenty<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.580> paint<00:01:42.010> now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
make sure you use plenty of paint now

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.100 
make sure you use plenty of paint now
the<00:01:43.100> reason<00:01:43.400> why<00:01:43.490> we're<00:01:43.640> doing<00:01:43.880> three<00:01:44.810> or<00:01:44.930> four

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
the reason why we're doing three or four

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.480 
the reason why we're doing three or four
a<00:01:45.140> time<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.880> try<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.450> do<00:01:47.720> too<00:01:48.350> many<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
a time is to try to do too many and the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.420 
a time is to try to do too many and the
paint<00:01:49.729> will<00:01:49.909> start<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.240> dry<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.040> won't<00:01:52.280> go

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
paint will start to dry and you won't go

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.700 
paint will start to dry and you won't go
to<00:01:52.490> lay<00:01:52.640> them<00:01:52.759> off<00:01:52.880> with<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.119> brush<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.530> once

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
to lay them off with a brush so once

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.600 
to lay them off with a brush so once
that's<00:01:54.890> done<00:01:55.190> just<00:01:55.430> get<00:01:55.759> your<00:01:55.880> brush<00:01:56.090> and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
that's done just get your brush and

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.900 
that's done just get your brush and
ladle<00:01:58.610> off<00:02:00.100> now<00:02:01.100> there<00:02:01.310> may<00:02:01.460> be<00:02:01.490> some<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
ladle off now there may be some of the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.609 
ladle off now there may be some of the
joins<00:02:04.910> or<00:02:05.390> need<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.840> little<00:02:06.080> bit<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.259> extra

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
joins or need a little bit of extra

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.669 
joins or need a little bit of extra
attention<00:02:06.800> with<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.369> bit<00:02:07.550> more<00:02:07.700> paint<00:02:08.679> but

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
attention with a bit more paint but

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.460 
attention with a bit more paint but
hopefully<00:02:10.720> when<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.750> roll<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.080> you've

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
hopefully when you roll it you've

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.130 
hopefully when you roll it you've
actually<00:02:12.590> filled<00:02:13.070> most<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.489> them<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:17.480> this

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
actually filled most of them in and this

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.370 
actually filled most of them in and this
is<00:02:18.200> one<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.620> quickest<00:02:19.070> ways<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.380> best

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
is one of the quickest ways and best

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:32.650 
is one of the quickest ways and best
ways<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.680> paint<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.390> timber<00:02:23.390> ceiling<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.510> when

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
ways to paint a timber ceiling so when

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.340 
ways to paint a timber ceiling so when
you're<00:02:32.780> finished<00:02:33.200> lay<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.950> off<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.840> forget

ceiling now if you've got a larger

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.990 
ceiling now if you've got a larger
ceiling<00:02:59.930> like<00:03:00.049> a<00:03:00.079> bedroom<00:03:00.530> ceiling<00:03:00.739> etc<00:03:01.430> when

you're actually painting it you want to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.190 
you're actually painting it you want to
work<00:03:04.489> in<00:03:04.670> small<00:03:04.790> sections<00:03:04.970> basic<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:05.959> I've

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
work in small sections basic like I've

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.190 
work in small sections basic like I've
done<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.680> then<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.430> continue<00:03:07.900> working<00:03:08.900> down

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
done and then just continue working down

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.380 
done and then just continue working down
the<00:03:09.560> boards<00:03:09.920> until<00:03:10.850> you<00:03:10.940> finish<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.360> whole

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
the boards until you finish the whole

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.080 
the boards until you finish the whole
section<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.799> idea<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.610> make<00:03:13.760> sure<00:03:13.970> you

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
section the idea is to make sure you

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.380 
section the idea is to make sure you
don't<00:03:14.239> let<00:03:14.450> any<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.140> paint<00:03:15.859> ninjas<00:03:16.190> dry<00:03:16.459> so

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
don't let any of the paint ninjas dry so

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.460 
don't let any of the paint ninjas dry so
you<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.600> want<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.840> work<00:03:17.959> in<00:03:18.170> small<00:03:18.440> sections

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
you just want to work in small sections

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.310 
you just want to work in small sections
say<00:03:19.310> roughly<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.700> meter<00:03:20.000> by<00:03:20.420> 3<00:03:20.450> or<00:03:20.840> 4<00:03:21.019> boards

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
say roughly a meter by 3 or 4 boards

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.530 
say roughly a meter by 3 or 4 boards
wide<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.910> continue<00:03:22.910> working<00:03:23.150> along<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
wide and continue working along the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.110 
wide and continue working along the
ceiling<00:03:23.870> until<00:03:24.200> you've<00:03:25.010> finished<00:03:25.220> one

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
ceiling until you've finished one

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.810 
ceiling until you've finished one
complete<00:03:26.540> section<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.200> then<00:03:27.859> start<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.700> next

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
complete section and then start the next

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.880 
complete section and then start the next
section<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.600> do<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> same<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:30.410> walk<00:03:30.620> down

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
section and do the same and walk down

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.580 
section and do the same and walk down
along<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.250> ceiling<00:03:32.109> so<00:03:33.109> that's<00:03:33.290> just<00:03:33.380> been<00:03:33.530> a

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
along the ceiling so that's just been a

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.130 
along the ceiling so that's just been a
bit<00:03:33.799> of<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.950> demo<00:03:34.280> on<00:03:34.459> how<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.329> paint<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.810> timber
