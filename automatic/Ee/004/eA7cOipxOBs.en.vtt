00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
you I bought this back in 1998 when I

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.300 
you I bought this back in 1998 when I
was<00:00:19.240> drag<00:00:19.539> racing<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.960> motorcycles<00:00:20.560> and<00:00:20.770> I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
was drag racing the motorcycles and I

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.400 
was drag racing the motorcycles and I
used<00:00:21.490> it<00:00:21.610> for<00:00:21.670> a<00:00:21.820> tow<00:00:22.060> vehicle<00:00:22.539> and<00:00:23.050> after<00:00:23.380> I

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
used it for a tow vehicle and after I

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.160 
used it for a tow vehicle and after I
put<00:00:23.740> 11,000<00:00:24.310> miles<00:00:24.460> on<00:00:24.730> it<00:00:24.760> I<00:00:25.060> decided<00:00:25.930> it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
put 11,000 miles on it I decided it

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.160 
put 11,000 miles on it I decided it
needed<00:00:26.199> more<00:00:26.590> power<00:00:26.830> so<00:00:27.730> I<00:00:28.119> ended<00:00:28.810> up<00:00:28.930> going

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
needed more power so I ended up going

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.229 
needed more power so I ended up going
with<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.699> TRD<00:00:31.289> kit<00:00:32.519> the<00:00:33.519> TRD<00:00:33.879> supercharger
