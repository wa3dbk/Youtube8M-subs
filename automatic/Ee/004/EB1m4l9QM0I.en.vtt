00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.450
 When it comes to making dresses a doll can be of great help 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.070
 These dolls are known as mannequins for sewing and they are 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.930
 life-size reproductions of the human body give a figure where 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.980
 adjustment problems can be solved and they are also used to exhibit costumes in 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.849
 showcases where everything looks very elegant 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.849
 so much 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.159
 I love 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.109
 for centuries the fashion industry used mannequins for customers 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.329
 they do not have to endure the extensive peace measurements sometimes they are made 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.749
 Last name molds to replicate the exact size of the client's body 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.820
 the world the nba 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.770
 to be a sewing mannequin 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 it begins by soaking cardboard in water 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.370
 it is resistant and porous so it can withstand a lot of water without breaking 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.450
 mmm bank 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.070
 a woman rear positioning a plaster mold 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.580
 after a sheet of cardboard was cut in two the worker dips his 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 gloved hand in a paste gil applied on cardboard 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 This paste is a combination of plaster and glue 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.400
 then in a process called diffusion a series of breaks are made 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.800
 on the edge of the cardboard 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.430
 then the cardboard covered with glue is pressed against the shape of a 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.130
 Dump body forming several layers some pieces are put along 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.130
 others horizontally to achieve tight interlacing 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.640
 the overlap of the edges helps to interlace the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.300
 and a few blows with the hammer the pairings 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.300
 some of the edges rise 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 and the front part of the body is fixed to the back 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.370
 Cardboard shapes fit perfectly one on another is required 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.020
 of more pasta to say and count 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.830
 the worker manipulates the end of a tool to apply paste inside 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.830
 the cavity after pando the loose layers with glue 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.960
 finally the mold opens to discover the shape 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 this size is size 12 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.639
 After 24 hours drying outdoors, the manikin is brought to the oven where 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639
 heated 176 degrees for eight hours 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.259
 this steam to moisture and hardens the mannequin 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.229
 a worker removes the two stars for this purpose 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.639
 and then in line to match it 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.639
 two 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.059
 another worker after aligning in the country and with the same 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.419
 you will use these marks as days as you cut the dummy to leave the 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.419
 folding shoulders 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.269
 Slots are carved on each side of the mannequin 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.269
 and layers fall off on each side that the grooves 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.709
 this allows you to install hinges paired with the manikin so that 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.709
 excel by interfering with blessings 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.229
 then the sewing mannequin is subjected to a large surgery 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.489
 a worker cuts both shoulders 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.489
 but leaves them attached to the rest of the year and through the hinges 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.089
 makes sure they work correctly 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.879
 then he cut the Maliki through the incisions 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.650
 this will allow the shoulders to be applied which was easier to put on and take out 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.650
 clothing 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.119
 This piece of malleable steel is a spring for a mechanism that fixes 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.119
 folding shoulders in your position 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.769
 wooden supports are fixed on each shoulder together with the rest of the mechanism 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.769
 fixation 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:14.799
 now the mannequin is covered with layers of knitting the thread of the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.539
 wine 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.729
 these rentals will serve as a reference point for the seamstress 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.979
 another worker washes the surface with a sponge, adjusting the TV to the Maliki 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.159
 the mannequin is to say the approval stamp 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.990
 Then a metal poyete is added to the headless body 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.309
 and is covered with a golden accessory 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.130
 so a tailor made sewing mannequin is made
