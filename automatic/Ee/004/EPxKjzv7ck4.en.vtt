00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.010 
anything and I thinking of doing a trade
with<00:00:34.559> someone<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.190> YouTube<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.660> sure

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
those in Canada so I don't think of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.680 
those in Canada so I don't think of
doing<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.969> quite<00:00:39.270> soon<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.360> am<00:00:42.540> going

in the now I'm megazor and this is a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
in the now I'm megazor and this is a
first<00:00:53.940> day<00:00:54.149> trying<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.989> there's<00:00:55.199> literally

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
first day trying it so there's literally

first day trying it so there's literally
the<00:00:56.399> boys<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.789> literally<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.690> come<00:00:57.899> back

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the boys have literally just come back

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.799 
the boys have literally just come back
in<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.379> Hank<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.300> seem<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> really

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
in this Hank and so they seem to really

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.870 
in this Hank and so they seem to really
like<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> mega<00:01:03.000> job<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> got<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
like it this is a mega job that got and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.950 
like it this is a mega job that got and
its<00:01:05.880> northern<00:01:06.479> crap<00:01:07.369> draya's<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.540> think

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
its northern crap draya's and I think

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.070 
its northern crap draya's and I think
that<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> company<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:12.390> can't<00:01:12.780> tell<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that is the company and I can't tell you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.570 
that is the company and I can't tell you
how<00:01:13.260> big<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> bag<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.280> can't

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
how big this bag is because I can't

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
how big this bag is because I can't
remember<00:01:14.880> off<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.229> head<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
remember off the top of my head but I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
remember off the top of my head but I
will<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> description<00:01:17.850> bar<00:01:18.390> below

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
will put it in the description bar below

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.450 
will put it in the description bar below
and<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:20.100> cost<00:01:20.430> me<00:01:20.729> 11<00:01:21.390> pounds<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> pretty

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and this cost me 11 pounds it's a pretty

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.469 
and this cost me 11 pounds it's a pretty
big<00:01:23.729> bag<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.610> reason<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.909> decided<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
big bag and and the reason I decided to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.010 
big bag and and the reason I decided to
swap<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:28.700> wood<00:01:29.700> shavings<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.509> mega<00:01:30.689> zorb

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
swap from wood shavings to mega zorb

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.010 
swap from wood shavings to mega zorb
it's<00:01:31.439> because<00:01:31.920> i<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.020> more

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it's because i think it's and more

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
it's because i think it's and more
cost-effective<00:01:34.890> seem<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.299> bigger

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
cost-effective seem to get like bigger

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.539 
cost-effective seem to get like bigger
bags<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:39.200> seems<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.740> further<00:01:41.130> as

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
bags and it seems to go a lot further as

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.230 
bags and it seems to go a lot further as
well<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:44.250> gerbils<00:01:44.670> seem<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.060> like

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
well and the gerbils seem to really like

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.319 
well and the gerbils seem to really like
it<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> seems<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.090> quite<00:01:48.090> good

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it so it seems to be like and quite good

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.139 
it so it seems to be like and quite good
for<00:01:48.509> tunneling<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:50.670> hopefully<00:01:50.850> they'll

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
for tunneling and to hopefully they'll

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.600 
for tunneling and to hopefully they'll
really<00:01:51.329> enjoy<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:53.509> hopefully<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:55.200> will

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
really enjoy that and hopefully it will

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.120 
really enjoy that and hopefully it will
minimize<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> smell<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> little<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:58.130> because

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
minimize the smell a little bit because

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.969 
minimize the smell a little bit because
these<00:01:59.430> guys<00:01:59.700> are<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.060> only<00:02:00.090> ones<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.469> in

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
these guys are the only ones that are in

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
these guys are the only ones that are in
the<00:02:02.189> house<00:02:02.369> at<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> moment<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.329> other<00:02:03.509> ones

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the house at the moment the other ones

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.310 
the house at the moment the other ones
are<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.320> garage<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.630> which<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.810> indoors

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
are in my garage and which is indoors

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.050 
are in my garage and which is indoors
but<00:02:07.619> obviously<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.369> separate<00:02:08.729> from<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
but obviously it's separate from the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.809 
but obviously it's separate from the
house<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.459> doesn't<00:02:11.819> really<00:02:11.910> matter

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
house and so it doesn't really matter

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.610 
house and so it doesn't really matter
not<00:02:13.150> buying<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.540> freshest<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.200> these<00:02:14.349> ones

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
not buying the freshest but these ones

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.679 
not buying the freshest but these ones
are<00:02:14.799> in<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.129> office<00:02:15.489> though<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.909> does<00:02:16.450> really

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
are in the office though it does really

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:22.349

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
all goes down hopefully and would be

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.580

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
really good it seems that and other

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.490 
really good it seems that and other
people<00:02:51.219> that<00:02:51.639> I<00:02:51.669> see<00:02:52.030> have<00:02:52.870> their<00:02:53.049> gerbils<00:02:53.409> on

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
people that I see have their gerbils on

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.659 
people that I see have their gerbils on
it<00:02:53.620> seemed<00:02:53.859> to<00:02:54.010> really<00:02:54.189> really<00:02:54.549> like<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.209> I

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
it seemed to really really like it and I

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.849 
it seemed to really really like it and I
also<00:02:57.669> switch<00:02:58.120> because<00:02:58.359> I've<00:02:59.349> been<00:02:59.530> having<00:02:59.799> a

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
also switch because I've been having a

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.939 
also switch because I've been having a
lot<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.069> problems<00:03:00.639> of<00:03:00.790> my<00:03:00.909> allergies<00:03:01.389> and<00:03:01.949> it

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:02.949 
lot of problems of my allergies and it

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.770 
lot of problems of my allergies and it
was<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.280> lot<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.669> was<00:03:03.790> linked<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.060> hay<00:03:04.329> fever

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
was a lot of it was linked to hay fever

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.979 
was a lot of it was linked to hay fever
and<00:03:05.049> then<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:05.829> was<00:03:06.040> like<00:03:06.129> an<00:03:06.370> unknown<00:03:06.989> allergy

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
and then I was like an unknown allergy

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.020 
and then I was like an unknown allergy
cause<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.680> which<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.489> think<00:03:09.730> was<00:03:09.909> sawdust<00:03:10.480> so

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
cause and which I think was sawdust so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.509 
cause and which I think was sawdust so
hopefully<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.239> will<00:03:13.449> be<00:03:13.659> a<00:03:14.310> lot<00:03:15.310> better

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
hopefully this will be a lot better

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.869 
hopefully this will be a lot better
because<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.439> the<00:03:17.709> wood<00:03:17.949> pulp<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.609> it's

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
because it is the wood pulp that it's

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.439 
because it is the wood pulp that it's
like<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> different<00:03:19.470> kind<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:21.129> hopefully<00:03:21.449> it's

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
like a different kind so hopefully it's

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.479 
like a different kind so hopefully it's
really<00:03:22.780> not<00:03:22.900> dusty<00:03:23.349> as<00:03:23.439> well<00:03:23.650> but<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.099> smell

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
really not dusty as well but the smell

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.689

I've done the smell is just so strong
and<00:03:27.699> to<00:03:28.150> me<00:03:28.299> but<00:03:28.979> it's<00:03:29.979> good<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.459> not<00:03:30.609> like<00:03:30.759> a

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849
