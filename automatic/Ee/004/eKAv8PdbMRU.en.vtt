00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.179
 hello to all and that's the team there 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.099
 still believes today new advice 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.049
 minutes we will be interested 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 especially to the combat shield in tvt or 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.420
 there you may have noticed it had in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 any case in game when we are attacked 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.359
 simply by an opponent who has 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 already have tanks and we only have 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.840
 marines the miss combat can you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.390
 save the life we ​​could see 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.309
 some examples in game always 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.350
 always in mini paceman we have 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.880
 example a time that facing marine who has 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.290
 just right but stimulating the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.090
 most of the time you know we start 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 by the otherwise if the improvement the most 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.719
 long in terrade so obviously 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 try to advance it first but is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.750
 this the right choice 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.670
 in any case we will immediately see the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.730
 difference so there the maritime and go 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.020
 a time are you going to see what it's like 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.699
 there is less shock directly 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.239
 so there for once when the opponent 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.969
 to tanks 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.149
 we are a little disappointed when we go to 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 see so this famous this famous time that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.480
 will be present we will make an example 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 a suite quickly a little lamb 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.729
 fishing imagine the same opponent 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.560
 bordeaux 6 204 marine passes to 16 marie 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.299
 who do not have the cheese shield you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.119
 reminiscent of the sixteen navy do you 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.680
 always attack the stimulant we go 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 they are obviously agent as we have 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.590
 could see 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.150
 then go from the previous example on 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.040
 happens to everything for marine not even the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.869
 fourth for your soul with 4 that's 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.140
 still quite a bit we will move on to a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.939
 Another example we will add the bouquet 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.700
 paying the difference we always have the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.079
 bottom of the barrel facing this time that we are going 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.950
 play or do not always make the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 sign sent 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.000
 we are not going to pay one shot already 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.070
 big difference he'll succeed at 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 to reach the contact is touched this time 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.880
 that casually it makes a good 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.530
 difference we will lose the same example 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.590
 as we had previously thought 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.170
 I want to have sat with both tanks and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.140
 four marines here present europe on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.439
 is still here we put the 4 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.750
 March 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.329
 we had our corn yield lot I'm going 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.159
 go down we'll go get all this 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.340
 always the sign on you know we did not 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.950
 no improvement it is 0.01 0.09 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.840
 leak roma on it goes 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 and we'll go get the tanks already 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.140
 obviously they will not do one shot there 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.090
 gets to touch a lot more 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.300
 easily and behind they come to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.099
 kill all all the time obviously 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.300
 enemy the army and we still 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.340
 9 marine behind so big fat 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.040
 big difference that we have seen that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.690
 the fight shield facing precisely 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.920
 an opponent who has tanks remember 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.540
 not this improvement for example when 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.150
 you are at CG feel a little bit 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.040
 aculate wait for your battle shield 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.930
 when you are going to want to make a 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.130
 exit for example little advice yet 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.470
 once tried 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.209
 if you can take some vcs 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.980
 also yet kg and the first shots 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.200
 times that way first 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.970
 damage which will still allow me a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.680
 once we get to get banged before 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.819
 to get to the contact bouquet fight the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.590
 big difference instead of doing a 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.920
 one shot by the agreement you're going to have 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.349
 one more blow we are pretty no 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.030
 negligible especially that's when you 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.250
 have only marines so that was the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.549
 advice minutes sarenza.com thank you 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.549
 followed me
