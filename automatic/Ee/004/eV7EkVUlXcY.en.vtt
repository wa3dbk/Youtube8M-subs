in<00:01:58.619> later<00:01:59.159> so<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> first<00:02:00.509> component<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.049> come

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.740 
in later so the first component to come
out<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> new<00:02:01.770> rear<00:02:02.189> facing<00:02:02.460> camera<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.719> has
