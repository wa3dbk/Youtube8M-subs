00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.259 

first<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.400> all<00:02:39.489> what<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.790> your<00:02:40.000> answer<00:02:40.120> to

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.899 
in court
well<00:02:44.409> I<00:02:44.440> think<00:02:44.560> he's<00:02:44.830> very<00:02:44.890> lucky<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.580> the

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
well I think he's very lucky that the

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.670 
well I think he's very lucky that the
statute<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.390> limitations<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.019> like<00:02:47.230> six<00:02:47.590> years

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
statute of limitations is like six years

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.460 
statute of limitations is like six years
in<00:02:48.250> most<00:02:48.459> states<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.299> California<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.440> I

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
in most states in California it is so I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.580 
in most states in California it is so I
think<00:02:50.590> he's<00:02:50.860> or<00:02:51.370> they're<00:02:51.849> just<00:02:51.879> allegations

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
think he's or they're just allegations

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.229 
think he's or they're just allegations
well<00:02:53.590> yes<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:54.610> say<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.940> but<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.150> know

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.850 

think<00:04:41.660> there's<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.990> larger<00:04:42.320> issue<00:04:42.500> which<00:04:42.590> is

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
think there's a larger issue which is

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.080 
think there's a larger issue which is
why<00:04:43.130> is<00:04:43.910> there<00:04:44.540> so<00:04:45.169> little<00:04:45.699> outrage<00:04:46.699> and<00:04:47.000> I

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
why is there so little outrage and I

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.460 
why is there so little outrage and I
think<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.600> same<00:04:47.810> as<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.199> know<00:04:48.290> all<00:04:48.380> the

think it's the same as you know all the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.080 
think it's the same as you know all the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
age why you wrote a book about him you'd

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.330
