felts<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.409> top<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.339> them<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> piece<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
felts on top of them we put a piece of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.510 
felts on top of them we put a piece of
vinyl<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.320> vinyl<00:01:07.740> also<00:01:08.070> gives<00:01:08.340> us<00:01:08.460> some

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
vinyl the vinyl also gives us some

vinyl the vinyl also gives us some
gripping<00:01:09.210> power<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:11.780> test<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
gripping power I test it for the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.499 
gripping power I test it for the
pressure<00:01:13.890> seems<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.090> about<00:01:15.270> right<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:17.509> like

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
pressure seems to be about right I like

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.960 
pressure seems to be about right I like
to<00:01:18.630> fold<00:01:18.840> those<00:01:19.049> felts<00:01:19.619> back<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> my<00:01:20.310> way
