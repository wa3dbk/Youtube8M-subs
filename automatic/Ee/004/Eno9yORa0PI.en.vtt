00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.440
 among the many regulatory changes in force since this year, those are those 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 which had a greater impact on the f150 project 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.879
 the fundamental aspects that have affected the regulation changes 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:19.749
 members who have undoubtedly impacted the most are the usual developments for 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.339
 account of star or dynamic 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.380
 funny the car changed particularly in this respect 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.630
 we will no longer see double fury 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.490
 we will not see any more from you 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.500
 the pilot will no longer be able to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 to change the characteristics I was machine dynamics 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 the bottom 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130
 program of fairs 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.810
 without 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.950
 in the central part 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.840
 and the rear wing fundamental change will be a rear wing 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.040
 mobile that will allow the pilot to be able to get past the cars that 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.630
 precede and be able to use it freely in qualifying 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.140
 in particular change has had an impact on the general yout 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.330
 of the car 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.650
 the reintroduction red Ikea 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.650
 this too amg a device 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.790
 kurt if used point of view of size 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.730
 quite 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.500
 cumbersome then 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.370
 forced our designers to review everything play out 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.290
 of reading 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.450
 to finish safety standards 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.680
 we have been protagonists consideration in proposing the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.909
 security improvements is what remains a formidable eurosport formula 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.970
 1 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.390
 you could call this machine an evolution, I have a revolution 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 compared to last year's car 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.530
 precisely because of these wambie regulatory changes 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.410
 the dyeing machine be a 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.500
 in some areas 11 on cutting respect 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.150
 to the car of the previous year I condone the new well and i concepts 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.150
 new intel new lines of development 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.659
 from the general aesthetic point of view 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.229
 by regulation of formula 1 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:18.589
 always keeps 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.799
 rather harness the cars and then the cars 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.199
 they will resemble those of the previous year 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.199
 test. technical ist will be fundamentally different 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:34.489
 the f 150 we see today how it deals with will evolve in the coming weeks 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.769
 sil the evolution of the f150 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 2 was conceived but how to do it 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.209
 a first phase is that. of the winter tests 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.029
 movie 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.180
 where the development is mainly the mechanical part 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.130
 then key blade. structural mechanical view I mean frame or gearbox 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.589
 suspensions 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:01.959
 sava 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.929
 it will remain the same even during the first races it took me from the point of view 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:13.669
 aro dynamic in this guise an absolutely temporary garment 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.089
 and also rather simplified to be able to 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:19.410
 to me to do the first tests 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.110
 waiting lidel real development rodin friend for the first race 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.309
 what were the most challenging challenges in this from your point of view 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.409
 project 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.789
 but since 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.929
 I said before starting a dark blog 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.379
 White sheet 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.549
 at the rear of the machine 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.379
 with the abolition of 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.449
 m 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.989
 and the double of fury 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.499
 f some and trust a series of regulatory clarifications 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.060
 around. 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.360
 the area of ​​the car fund was really due 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.090
 start again from the beginning e 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.579
 rethink a little 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.749
 this year, we are sewing a new tire supplier 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.749
 the pirelli tires are still a question mark 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.839
 mattel 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.049
 the compensation project these tires 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.410
 he was born of nothing on TV everyone yes 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:24.529
 mhl few months car to develop these tires I think he has done already 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:25.789
 a good job 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.779
 for what still a lot to do 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.010
 we still have to 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.229
 try for several I run 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.819
 while ch'er regarding the constructions it seems that 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.870
 we are already on the sea 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.909
 a condition rather 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.680
 good i rather reliable then 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.629
 there is still much to do a topic of maximum attention 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.500
 very important, especially winter tests allow. the car 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.500
 around I attach put 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.430
 how to prepare TV 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.430
 for the track debut 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.290
 if the structure the ferrari work method in recent years is 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.969
 progressively changed 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.759
 as I said last year they used to go for me 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.969
 to do many kilometers of track 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.389
 today it is on the track 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.879
 yes text only during February 4 text 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.830
 there is no time to solve fundamental linked problems 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.020
 reliability therefore all this work has moved him to the benches for which 

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:42.179
 and in these days we are testing subgroups of the car i 

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:47.379
 benches to prove their functionality and fatigue so as to go into 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.379
 track with an already reliable car 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.490
 you personally essential obligation to win this year 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.590
 just the doors only the very short question answered very short yes
