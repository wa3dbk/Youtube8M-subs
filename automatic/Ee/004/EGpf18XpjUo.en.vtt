so I've got this like 20 dollar airsoft

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.150 
so I've got this like 20 dollar airsoft
gun<00:00:02.850> from<00:00:03.090> Walmart<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.720> it<00:00:04.290> used<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.830> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
gun from Walmart and it used to have a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.830 
gun from Walmart and it used to have a
battery<00:00:05.759> pack<00:00:06.120> on<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.810> back<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:08.840> like

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
battery pack on the back like this like

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.669 
battery pack on the back like this like
that<00:00:10.219> and<00:00:11.219> then<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> pull<00:00:11.820> handle<00:00:12.210> up<00:00:12.330> there

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
that and then the pull handle up there

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.900 
that and then the pull handle up there
but<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.740> took<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> batteries<00:00:14.400> off<00:00:14.580> cut<00:00:14.759> that

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
but I took the batteries off cut that

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.310 
but I took the batteries off cut that
off<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:16.490> like<00:00:17.490> there<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> switch<00:00:18.840> right

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
off and like there is a switch right

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.650 
off and like there is a switch right
there<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.340> trigger<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:20.760> there<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.570> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
there and the trigger right there and I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.090 
there and the trigger right there and I
cut<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> wires<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.230> those<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:22.859> put

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
cut the wires to those and just put

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.259 
cut the wires to those and just put
wires<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:24.000> straight<00:00:24.480> from<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> motor<00:00:26.269> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
wires going straight from the motor to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.640 
wires going straight from the motor to
this<00:00:27.420> jst<00:00:28.279> connector<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.029> when<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> plug<00:00:31.109> this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
this jst connector so when I plug this

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.760 
this jst connector so when I plug this
in<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.630> battery<00:00:33.649> it<00:00:34.649> shoots<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> I'll<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.680> this

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
in a battery it shoots so I'll put this

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.130 
in a battery it shoots so I'll put this
on<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> plane<00:00:38.250> maybe<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> weighs<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.540> six

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
on a plane maybe but it weighs like six

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.369 
on a plane maybe but it weighs like six
or<00:00:40.290> seven<00:00:40.320> ounces<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.579> heavy<00:00:42.379> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
or seven ounces so it's really heavy so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:56.600 
or seven ounces so it's really heavy so
now<00:00:44.040> I'll<00:00:44.280> test-fire<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> thing

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
now I'll test-fire it so this thing

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
now I'll test-fire it so this thing
shoots<00:00:56.910> faster<00:00:57.600> than<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.930> did<00:00:58.079> before<00:00:58.260> with

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
shoots faster than it did before with

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
shoots faster than it did before with
the<00:00:58.829> double-a<00:00:59.280> batteries<00:00:59.699> because<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.420> it's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the double-a batteries because now it's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.840 
the double-a batteries because now it's
running<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.109> cell<00:01:01.379> lipo<00:01:01.699> it's<00:01:02.699> more

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
running on a two cell lipo it's more

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.539 
running on a two cell lipo it's more
voltage<00:01:03.359> than<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> double-a<00:01:04.260> batteries<00:01:04.739> so

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
voltage than the double-a batteries so

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.330 
voltage than the double-a batteries so
if<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.170> plane<00:01:07.470> flies<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.250> I'll

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
if I do if this plane flies then I'll

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
if I do if this plane flies then I'll
probably<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:08.790> I'll<00:01:09.060> try<00:01:09.270> I'll<00:01:09.540> probably<00:01:09.780> try

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
probably put I'll try I'll probably try

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.679 
probably put I'll try I'll probably try
and<00:01:10.140> put<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> airsoft<00:01:10.680> gun<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
and put the airsoft gun on it this is

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.850 
and put the airsoft gun on it this is
the<00:01:12.780> motor<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.439> my<00:01:13.560> vertical

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the motor that was in my vertical

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370 
the motor that was in my vertical
takeoff<00:01:14.310> tube<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> big<00:01:15.869> delta<00:01:16.229> wing

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
takeoff tube and just a big delta wing

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.520 
takeoff tube and just a big delta wing
with<00:01:16.740> elevon<00:01:17.220> x'<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> rudder<00:01:18.170> 2200<00:01:19.170> milliamp

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
with elevon x' and rudder 2200 milliamp

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.969 
with elevon x' and rudder 2200 milliamp
battery

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
battery

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
battery
you<00:01:20.729> see<00:01:20.909> virgos<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.720> receivers<00:01:22.110> right<00:01:22.259> there

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you see virgos the receivers right there

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.429 
you see virgos the receivers right there
and<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> thing<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.540> probably<00:01:24.960> couldn't<00:01:25.259> put

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and the thing is I probably couldn't put

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.200 
and the thing is I probably couldn't put
the<00:01:25.590> gun<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.250> shooting<00:01:26.549> straight<00:01:26.790> forward

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the gun like shooting straight forward

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.690 
the gun like shooting straight forward
so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> either<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> put<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> shooting<00:01:29.070> down

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so I either have to put it shooting down

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.410 
so I either have to put it shooting down
or<00:01:30.090> backwards<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> side<00:01:32.210> or<00:01:33.210> kind

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
or backwards or like to the side or kind

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
or backwards or like to the side or kind
of<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.579> forward<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.350> if<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.439> thing

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
of down and forward so if this thing

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.219 
of down and forward so if this thing
flies<00:01:37.920> I'll<00:01:38.159> try<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> gun<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.079> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
flies I'll try the gun out on it so this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.420 
flies I'll try the gun out on it so this
is<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> replacement<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
is kind of like a replacement for the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.219 
is kind of like a replacement for the
Super<00:01:41.700> Cub<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.210> aerial<00:01:42.540> video<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.020> bomb

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
Super Cub for aerial video and bomb

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.800 
Super Cub for aerial video and bomb
dropping<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.820> landing<00:01:45.360> gear<00:01:45.390> on

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
dropping it's got that landing gear on

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
dropping it's got that landing gear on
it<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.770> tail<00:01:46.950> skid<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> back<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.340> this

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it and the tail skid in the back so this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.170 
it and the tail skid in the back so this
will<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.670> flying<00:01:50.909> soon<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.189> also<00:01:53.189> here's<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
will be flying soon and also here's a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.719 
will be flying soon and also here's a
little<00:01:54.390> tiny<00:01:54.570> plane<00:01:55.009> 800,000,000<00:01:56.040> 3<00:01:56.490> cell

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
little tiny plane 800,000,000 3 cell

little tiny plane 800,000,000 3 cell
battery<00:01:57.119> here's<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.750> little<00:01:57.899> motor<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.219> I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
battery here's this little motor and I

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.819 
battery here's this little motor and I
have<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> prop<00:02:00.840> coming<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> mail<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.710> this

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
have a prop coming in the mail for this

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
have a prop coming in the mail for this
motor<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.549> once<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.450> it'll<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.810> ready

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
motor but once I get that it'll be ready

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
motor but once I get that it'll be ready
to<00:02:04.110> fly<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.159> super<00:02:05.610> fast

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to fly it's like a little super fast

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.779 
to fly it's like a little super fast
super<00:02:06.299> light<00:02:06.600> Dart<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.500> yeah<00:02:08.129> thanks<00:02:08.700> for
