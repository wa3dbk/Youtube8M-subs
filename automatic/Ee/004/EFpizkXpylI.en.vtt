00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
be so frigging hard to watch because

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
be so frigging hard to watch because
literally<00:00:33.870> he<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.770> doing<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> good

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
literally he was doing this for a good

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.660 
literally he was doing this for a good
10<00:00:35.940> minutes<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.620> quite<00:00:37.920> annoying<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
10 minutes and it was quite annoying and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.119 
10 minutes and it was quite annoying and
it<00:00:39.300> makes<00:00:39.480> your<00:00:39.600> body<00:00:39.870> fully<00:00:40.320> read<00:00:40.649> right<00:00:40.890> away

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it makes your body fully read right away

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.520 
it makes your body fully read right away
and<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:42.270> think<00:00:42.480> he<00:00:42.570> tries<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> signature

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and I think he tries to do a signature

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.930 
and I think he tries to do a signature
of<00:00:43.739> finisher<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.219> me<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.670> head<00:00:44.820> up

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
of finisher on me and I head up

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
of finisher on me and I head up
reversing<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> hit<00:00:46.980> him<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
reversing it and then I hit him with the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.650 
reversing it and then I hit him with the
claw<00:00:47.550> hold<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.940> couple<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> times<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.289> he<00:00:50.660> just

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
claw hold a couple of times and he just

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
claw hold a couple of times and he just
lets<00:00:51.899> me<00:00:52.170> continue<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.370> he<00:00:53.550> could

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
lets me continue to do it so he could

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.510 
lets me continue to do it so he could
reverse<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.170> which<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.440> well<00:00:55.680> played<00:00:55.980> by<00:00:56.190> him
