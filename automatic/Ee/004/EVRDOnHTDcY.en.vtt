00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.309
 convenience and benefits are largely due to 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.470
 the presence of a touch screen as 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.150
 the stylus here protrude finger and you can 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.000
 do everything you used to do 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.220
 ordinary mouse people in sensory 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.710
 The screens are really huge 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.750
 they are matrix capacitive and red 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.810
 and so on of course at home 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.130
 it is simply impossible to do but 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.869
 optical touch screen can be made 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.699
 absolutely at home with 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.590
 minimal set of stage tools 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.930
 cool everyone and even you 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.540
 subject to general we begin to follow 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.010
 carefully to create a personal 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.199
 multitouch device us with you 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.870
 will need a whole huge box and not 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.710
 not scary to see so many things in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.470
 first is white pure pair 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.890
 white paper details then us 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.260
 will need scissors ordinary cup 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.510
 the world’s cheapest you see how I don’t 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.489
 I appeal somehow not very carefully 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.890
 because this new photo frame with 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.900
 glass 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.379
 further there is a pencil incomprehensible 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.350
 what for 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.049
 but my cosmetic bag but you will not believe 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.700
 absolutely empty here is such a box 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.640
 in fact this is the most important element 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.060
 our entire multitouch device 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.280
 ring 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.290
 Here we will insert this photo frame 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.850
 plain white sheet of paper and here 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.250
 at the bottom middle 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.479
 why do we need a pencil we will do 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.100
 small hole to insert 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.100
 there we get the general went 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.729
 unfortunately the goal of os gives some 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.950
 error during operation is therefore better 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.329
 do not use office paper but white 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.920
 matt acrylic but that's what we 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.630
 used in principle also fit 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.770
 have already noticed here oh fell 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.240
 set in a hard process 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.340
 competent installation especially for 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.590
 girls so here we set here right 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.850
 so the camera so she looked at that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.520
 white sheet of paper which we put 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.399
 up so here we are on this very 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.410
 box set glass surface 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.840
 right in so here and close as if u 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.299
 we are here a cap from some 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.849
 of the subject in general, here is our multi touch 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.900
 ready and you can so grab a finger and 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.730
 everything will work of course 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.560
 you must first connect the camera to 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.299
 your computer 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 but it's not so easy to install 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.239
 certain words and this we will do 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.030
 right now 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.519
 But from this site we are downloading the car community 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.739
 vision for our operating system we 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.690
 took a working version for the sevens here 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.760
 on this link we take a virtual machine 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.379
 driver run the program which 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.569
 controls the webcam in the tab 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.549
 properties choose black and white mode with 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.680
 using brightness and contrast adjustments 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.810
 and din we will achieve to be seen 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.810
 just a touch of black 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.639
 finger pads starting the machine driver 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.959
 until it is activated we will start 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.489
 community car vision 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.190
 notice what should be 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.750
 included necessarily from the camera fraction so 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.280
 send them as a 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.680
 other indicators we have here in this 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.450
 position necessarily in calibrates by 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.329
 horizontals to move your finger in 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.769
 reality and the picture are very similar 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.540
 important point for correct operation 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.550
 programs need to determine the working 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.260
 region 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.660
 this screen shows what is watching 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.250
 the camera is our task to put a finger like this 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.260
 way that he was in the left 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.250
 top corner and put on a piece of paper 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.840
 . 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.400
 we will do the same with four 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.960
 points and connected them 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.120
 here is such a surface after that 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.430
 it needs to be calibrated on the keyboard 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.930
 press the English letter q and start 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.000
 follow the clouds that we 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.120
 offer maldor to calibrate all 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.980
 very simple and understandable after these 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.750
 Settings, press the spacebar, I activate 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.610
 car drivers and start driving 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.750
 computer using homemade 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.060
 touch screen 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.960
 try to do it yourself sure and u 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.960
 you will succeed
