00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello today on the survey of bliss 60 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.130
 057 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:16.610
 set and snow city motor home 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:21.770
 in the set there are two little men two oars 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:26.390
 k but i'm a collection of stickers that here 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:33.730
 stuck to the car in a canoe barely 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:36.730
 there are still life preservers 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.730
 frames 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.000
 and the reverse side 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 as seen from this picture opens 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:11.660
 up the roof is removed and the side wall 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.660
 also open look at the figure 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 then here is a man and a woman 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 they live in this motorhome 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.890
 traveling and canoeing 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.880
 paddle 1 2 paddle 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:45.390
 will be a little later start with this 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:51.170
 visual inspection of the car is not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.000
 looking far in through the windows 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.760
 toned and it is clear that there are two cups 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.880
 one driver 1 inside the house so 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.920
 made one car 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.740
 landing car low so if 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 the cover will be carpet then on it 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.940
 the car won't be good enough 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.540
 move such an original decision 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.360
 and somewhat strange but apparently already 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.640
 there was no other way to think 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.790
 attach these side mirrors and they 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.790
 mounted here on such mechanisms 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.450
 Both too clearly but we 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.450
 disconnects 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.060
 on him can 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.080
 put our tenants in 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.120
 pass them lucky 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.049
 put on life jackets which 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.060
 now there are even three here 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:05.769
 oars one spare 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:09.579
 and one more life jacket there on 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.129
 the picture indicated that this is this 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.849
 section should go up now 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.180
 try to pick it up I'm not 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:23.230
 tried to do now just saw 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.629
 let's see what happens and hook 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:33.280
 and do not break the roof floor 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:38.849
 and it turns out that the section with a roof here 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:42.129
 Here there is such a limiter and 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.099
 raise the roof if this is now the 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.160
 it turns out that we still have more 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.160
 section 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
 is formed 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.019
 so original and come to that 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.269
 penetrate the house inside there 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.769
 television 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:19.579
 the cup that we saw from the window table 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:24.120
 single seat in the cabin 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:27.600
 driver's seat and that's around 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.289
 Apparently some kind of yes the bed is this 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:37.080
 probably cushions or growth backs 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:40.340
 beds in general, such a house as you can see 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.930
 the house is made with architectural delights 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.930
 there is an arch 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.190
 there are stickers 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:59.000
 number number here stickers tv 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:02.599
