00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 moth ahrensburg alex welcome to me 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.950
 another consequence of way in league 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.870
 one last episode ran so yes it went 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.550
 Definitely better and yes that is 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.920
 our team here we now have elia for 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 perisic reingetan and the ewf is too 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 recovered and there have also 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.660
 storm peaks from the exchange so but 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.189
 on the side of before the ewv and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.449
 kiev on the side before it was easy 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.980
 because I want to test it out 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 and you can not say with him either 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.960
 we still have 100 % I believe 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.240
 coins but we also get it first 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 nothing there, yes, the players we 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.610
 need a bit more expensive than 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.320
 next I will think about that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.120
 right-back position take care of it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 you can also get some options 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.879
 otherwise I can not think of any one you can 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.140
 let's say what he's up to next 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.879
 should improve after the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 right-back and calls it a little bit 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.730
 to say we need four more points 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.739
 for the climb the thing should be in 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 this sequence also be managed 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 with the rise of the negative for the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.449
 optical wait but I am 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.789
 I'm pretty sure we will too 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.559
 still get so excited with us ours 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.629
 first opponent in this episode has one 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.290
 79 athen has had an informant 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:07.110
 English team but that sounds like it 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.799
 nevertheless, livia win so often already 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 have seen 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.420
 if we have the ball ball have solid 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.420
 intention 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:30.679
 all eyes jaja com familia please 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:32.179
 Any 3, that's your serious why 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.460
 you should also shoot up then came 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.170
 still on the ball to the header head what 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.240
 Once again you can also try the two 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.240
 on the subject head not open to the cockpit 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.069
 yep freezing the young can thereby 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.849
 otherwise somehow right in what would have 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:55.840
 Lately, but it can be 10 here 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.840
 reloading 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.569
 no we better the ball the ball change 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:19.540
 was it able to come make it 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:24.200
 I do not like I still get 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.730
 where do you care what are you doing out there? 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.359
 you can not just shoot 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:35.959
 can really work in half-time 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:37.880
 fighting game cramping game sorry in between 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.400
 go in between and there he was 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.819
 also very close 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.290
 how do you do that you do not do it 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.290
 why is it laying down again? 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.030
 away with the ball 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.880
 yes, where at the end 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.470
 getting more exciting is getting one to zero 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.180
 won that was a fight so directly the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.940
 second match afterwards 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.250
 have something like a team of 86 wanted me 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.480
 actually fooled 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.740
 how can you do it with such a tip 1 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.410
 league be eight as grandiose 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.900
 the really absolute hammer 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.160
 breakdown of ea's so approximately 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.140
 the same level has only synonymous 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.880
 tenth rating overall more faith 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.180
 I was never over a tenth I think 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.100
 why not a team? 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.930
 also repaired a league eight 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.710
 now we have the food with us 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:49.860
 fire word with start how do you run 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.860
 already you are easily the head 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.820
 Well, that 's the first goal against the team 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.930
 I've got that again 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.080
 not at all counted 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.210
 on the 10th you do not want to play anymore 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.380
 In fact, you do not want more 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.490
 play why presses on break as well 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.290
 enough my that's relative 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.100
 balanced there you can understand if 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.549
 you do not mind anymore 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.900
 what is he doing now what is happening now yes 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.880
 then opponents 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.420
 do something like to pause again 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.570
 and it was the most likely 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:40.150
 date at the psychiatrist 170 to tell 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:42.370
 get tutoring age does not matter to top 20 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.110
 in the type will be happy 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.670
 only played 15 minutes so I would have 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.010
 but that is rather the other way home was 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:54.460
 okay that is like to want to have 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:59.670
 not again hey thank you and play 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.670
 let's try it oh my god 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.080
 the thing was really incredible 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.020
 Can you combine it with describe it? 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.470
 It was you from the radio 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.440
 this is actually your serious 3 0 to 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.000
 half time no real goalshot what the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.640
 task a hundred times such cola balls 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.220
 a strong team is not everything but it 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.780
 is not over yet comes draxler 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.480
 and I can do it, I believe 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.270
 should have turned but often 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.710
 makes the thing not purely because it 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.480
 yes, yes, just push it again 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:55.330
 yes again to break as often as 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:58.000
 still the thing hatches me again 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:03.480
 You can just go in 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:12.700
 bad times we valid so please 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:14.890
 thanks and please always stand 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.600
 one is in between simply moves 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.440
 I no longer want that I do not bother anymore 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.300
 has and quits 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.730
 but not with me but then this one 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.920
 plan by looking is the ball 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.540
 path 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.540
 why are you doing there? 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.230
 faith are scarce broke 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.990
 or just shit and under human 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:44.690
 died only second tip presses me will 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.680
 so boring was shot too early 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.160
 shot too early 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.340
 I can still clearly more toward what 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.980
 is that nice please 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.140
 he was more than under control 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.630
 you 're kidding me the ea 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.550
 people then canada you can not soccer 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.170
 Do not you know that again works 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.120
 I can ask canadians at all 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.940
 at most ice hockey game yet no 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:15.080
 Soccer 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:17.210
 therefore 40 bit offense is really hard 4 0 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.010
 winning a good team also brings 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.840
 nothing if you just shit 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.340
 so people if all of you have an xbox 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.480
 weeks plus fifa needs the types 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.340
 In any case, no one needs us 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.890
 could just write this 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.210
 gamertag could see because if you 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.410
 you could not see anything then unfortunately you have 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.970
 also bad luck but he needs her 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.350
 apparently not anymore and before the 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.400
 while fucking him or something 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.380
 what he mentally comes out 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.300
 then prefers had fabricated then 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.550
 somehow you would have that needed 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.180
 So the climb is also safe 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:46.040
 one more point for the league title the 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.840
 Of course we will also pick up and 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.530
 we have a few more crosses now 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.820
 I will not be like that for now 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.590
 Get we look beginning next 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.440
 demonstrated how expensive because such a piste 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.310
 For example , many follow with the result 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.419
 thanks for watching if it's you 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.620
 liked it then gives the video yet 

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:04.600
 a thumbs up 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.600
 and there you see yourself next year
