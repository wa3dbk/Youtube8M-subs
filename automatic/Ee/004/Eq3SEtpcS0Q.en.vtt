all<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> way<00:01:18.240> around<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.659> room<00:01:20.000> quite<00:01:21.000> nicely

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.840 

now<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.860> might<00:01:26.040> think<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
now you might think that this is a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510 
now you might think that this is a
switch<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.869> there's<00:01:28.590> only<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.860> wire<00:01:29.250> running

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
switch but there's only one wire running

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
switch but there's only one wire running
from<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.960> switches<00:01:31.530> need

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
from it as you know what switches need

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
from it as you know what switches need
two<00:01:31.890> wires<00:01:33.619> pop<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.770> open<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.579> our<00:01:35.850> stylus

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
two wires pop this open there our stylus

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.210 
two wires pop this open there our stylus
tips<00:01:36.750> inside<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.490> metal<00:01:39.270> tin

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
tips inside this it's just a metal tin

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.120 
tips inside this it's just a metal tin
even<00:01:41.220> without<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> cap<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.770> still<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
even without the cap on it it's still a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
even without the cap on it it's still a
light<00:01:44.399> switch<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.570> still<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> fully

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
light switch and it's still a fully

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.139 
light switch and it's still a fully
functional<00:01:46.649> tin<00:01:46.939> on<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> back<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
functional tin on the back of here I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.920 
functional tin on the back of here I
soldered<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.570> wire<00:01:51.979> directly<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
soldered this wire directly to of the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:03.560 
soldered this wire directly to of the
tin<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:59.149> the<00:02:00.149> tin<00:02:01.369> it's<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:02.939> sensing

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
tin so the tin it's just really sensing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.089 
tin so the tin it's just really sensing
the<00:02:04.079> touch<00:02:04.430> I'm<00:02:05.430> using<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> CapSense<00:02:06.180> library

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
the touch I'm using the CapSense library

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.090 
the touch I'm using the CapSense library
to<00:02:08.099> turn<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> lights<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:08.910> off
