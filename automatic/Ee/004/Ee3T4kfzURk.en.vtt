separate review for that but I did have

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
separate review for that but I did have
a<00:00:38.250> comparison<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> new<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:41.180> but<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:43.140> one

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
a comparison to the new one but this one

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.799 
a comparison to the new one but this one
to<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.100> mean<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to me I mean it was really good when it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
to me I mean it was really good when it
came<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.410> were<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.610> were<00:00:47.730> all

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
came out we were I know we were all

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
came out we were I know we were all
really<00:00:48.090> excited<00:00:48.210> back<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.020> 99<00:00:49.289> when<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.739> got

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
really excited back in 99 when we got

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.250 
really excited back in 99 when we got
this<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> you've<00:00:51.750> seen<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> new

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
this but now that you've seen the new

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
this but now that you've seen the new
one<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> reminds<00:00:53.850> me<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.210> like

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
one this one kind of reminds me of like

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
one this one kind of reminds me of like
a<00:00:54.860> monopoly<00:00:55.860> piece<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.370> something<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
a monopoly piece or something like that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
a monopoly piece or something like that
because<00:00:57.239> there's<00:00:57.930> absolutely<00:00:58.109> no<00:00:58.739> movement

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
because there's absolutely no movement

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.569 
because there's absolutely no movement
in<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.300> figure<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
in it it's just a figure that's it you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.250 
in it it's just a figure that's it you
can<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.910> how<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> bottom<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.719> made<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
can see how the bottom is made and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.550 
can see how the bottom is made and
everything<00:01:05.270> but<00:01:06.270> nonetheless<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.260> great

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
everything but nonetheless it was great

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
everything but nonetheless it was great
when<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.600> were

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
when we got it because I think we were

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.800 
when we got it because I think we were
just<00:01:09.900> excited<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> figure<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.220> all

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
just excited to have the figure at all

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.440 
just excited to have the figure at all
now<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> new<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.119> came

arms was broke the little connector part
right<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:05.009> broke<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.969> arm<00:02:06.149> just

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
right here was broke so the arm just

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.680 
right here was broke so the arm just
won't<00:02:06.780> stay<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.200> good<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.940> mean<00:02:09.300> that's<00:02:09.420> kind

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
won't stay on good so I mean that's kind

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
won't stay on good so I mean that's kind
of<00:02:09.810> annoying<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.770> mean<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:11.819> think

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
of annoying but I mean I don't think

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.790 
of annoying but I mean I don't think
it's<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.989> pardon

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's just a pardon

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
it's just a pardon
in<00:02:13.890> general<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.330> really<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.170> piece

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
