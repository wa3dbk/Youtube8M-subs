 papaya martin was able to let go of a former top athlete in surf really 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.759
 the shot the board is the first tips to make a good tea 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:22.659
 Corsica 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.839
 big strap at the very beginning stand up beautiful moments and charged for 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:26.829
 to be ahead 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.929
 the right time it would be percent 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.140
 m laval the arrival like that actually 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.700
 auger laval went through there the bench which would be starting from there 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.520
 we need to know that from you which allows us not to start in the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.050
 empty if we stand there 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.510
 was really starting there and being able to really squat crouching and loaded 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.680
 to catch his speed at that time 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.490
 after all we have a song of both man when we have this speed for the 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.800
 quality is here 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.960
 the botox the pole to finance the pole contains the speed in the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.820
 swimming pool 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.970
 alas for the coward in the ascent to be able to put a big russia in 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.140
 first group and in addition the vacancy 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.909
 so in fact the greedy ser 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.190
 before it leaves 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.680
 we dream when it's like that as soon as it starts at the hearing the two 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 tips and load 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.200
 after that the speed 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.770
 the speed of the beginning of a wave on the on the tech rising which valued 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.510
 the wave that will give 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.940
 speed on the whole valley appreciation of the bars late 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.770
 and we do not have the speed 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.760
 we all will all say very often we put back in search of speed all the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.280
 high bar but maneuvers and often snatch a little late 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 when we make a beautiful french decor stand paul place really beard and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.040
 when loads well in general we go to lorient and here we are in advance so we 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.299
 step one can possibly do retyped tank codes one is all the time 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.470
 it's up to us to decide when to hit the valley and it's not 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.500
 she knows palavas who decided when we can do something 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.040
 so it's well rowed 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.770
 put your hands on the plane without hurrying well to pose in velay low on 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280
 the board once the countries that slipped from his well posed a lot when 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.640
 of the biennale that allows us to still baader well to charge for 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.130
 before the speed 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.090
 that's the base it's this caramel and put your hands on the board and never 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.050
 race 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.830
 it puts them off before the summer is placed
