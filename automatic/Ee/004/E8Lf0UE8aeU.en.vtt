go really fished out well in the rain
and<00:01:17.370> maintain<00:01:18.370> was<00:01:18.610> having<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.970> chabad<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.780> we

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
and maintain was having to chabad and we

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.540 
and maintain was having to chabad and we
come<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.440> conclusion<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:21.130> they<00:01:21.430> just

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550
