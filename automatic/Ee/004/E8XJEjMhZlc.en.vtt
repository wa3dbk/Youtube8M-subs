really fast and ya guys also another

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.180 
really fast and ya guys also another
thing<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:45.050> usually<00:01:46.050> when<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> system

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
thing is usually when you see the system

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.730 
thing is usually when you see the system
files<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.090> PNG<00:01:48.540> images<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.470> can't

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
files like the PNG images you can't

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.290 
files like the PNG images you can't
directly<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.310> them<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.730> when<00:01:50.910> you<00:01:51.000> move<00:01:51.180> them

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
directly see them and when you move them

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.670
