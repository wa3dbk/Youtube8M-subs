is<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.040> good<00:01:15.280> idea<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.790> inspect<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.210> tree<00:01:16.450> to

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
is a good idea to inspect the tree to

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.450 
is a good idea to inspect the tree to
see<00:01:16.810> if<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:17.080> have<00:01:17.230> any<00:01:17.350> remnants<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:17.980> the
