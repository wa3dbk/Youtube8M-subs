 and August and good to tell you not to buy 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.600
 much that the truth wanted to be video 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.800
 because a lot of you asked for it and 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.260
 well let's start first by 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.720
 makeup first with the palette 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.010
 of mix what they call you on you again 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.020
 same 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.640
 so the way in the sun brake 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.990
 is that if they go under 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.770
 this information 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.410
 a palette is this brings down here the 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.670
 trips to cade brochitas are shades 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:42.379
 lips party and these colors 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.239
 and above it brings the shadows that are all 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.370
 the colors that are in diamonds and 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.409

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.280
 well these are all colors and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.619
 honestly what reduces pigment a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.690
 heap and saw a lot of time without 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.180
 stop me lasted like 10 hours in the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.570
 I bet I'm not sure of going out 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.770
 190 pesos and it was really worth it 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.140
 after also shades I bought myself 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.220

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.270

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.070

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.180
 loops for diary the truth that I 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.359
 love and good I do not know using enough and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 it's not very much 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.859
 also makeup and finally what 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.740

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.840

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.369
 and good if also his name to sun is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.960
 I can not prove it yet because I'm 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.210
 ending the gay mix so good 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.209
 when finished he opened this to use and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.909
 well I told him that 35 and vÃ©lez has been 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.340
 What is makeup? Let's go for nails in 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.940
 first place I bought this pre plant from 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.830
 explain of chaska also bad design is 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 this that I love 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.440
 it's beautiful it's like that afterwards it's 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.230
 this I already know that it is this way 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.190
 little hearts and all that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.400
 And finally there is this it's that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.010
 sevilla and good I tell you each of 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.010
 these comes with his little girl plan and they come 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.370
 like 2 this our plus writer this 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.530
 control is that I honestly do not 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.739
 they liked it for nothing because they do not last anything 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.269
 less than yesterday and today I went for a walk and 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.129
 where do I get from practically 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.349
 so much of the stuck they look at what is my 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.659
 sleep now they are horrifying they are without 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.189
 painting is all that honestly I do not 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.139
 They liked because they do not last anything to me 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.710
 I had to lie down to sleep inma 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.900
 cost practically with the stickers 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.290
 intact do not wet them and nothing for the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.020
 style literally did not last anything and good 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.420
 I do not know about these, I'm going to use them 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.180
 those who do not abuse yet not to do 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.860
 some station or something so you want 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.630
 that lasts a couple of hours but 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.580
 honestly they are not worth it 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.950
 I recommend that you found a little more 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.320
 silver to buy myself I think that there 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.150
 the hits come out more and last much longer 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.160
 so good time I'm going to try 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.050
 other brands to see that they are going and 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.870
 this cost me diaz pesos each and 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.299
 expression store 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.610
 so well these are the types of 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.420
 kidnapping that after also nails 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.580
 buy what is this planchita well 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.590
 this roll that brings this design of 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.360
 kisses and colored dots that we 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.060
 this one they will see but they are two points 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.860
 colors I do not know if the camera is going to 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.920
 grab by the light that there are but are 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.379
 all colors and and well this one came out 15 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.030
 weights and it's an iron so what 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.489
 we do is when the enamel 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.040
 fresh about to dry we paste the 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.900
 planchita and then we remove it 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.450
 then all the enclosures and the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.220
 colored dots stuck in the zones 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.459
 and this plastic practically remains 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.709
 empty and disappear then we stay 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.030
 very cute I tried it on a nail this 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.070
 I will see when I have a little time 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.889
 to do the others and show them how 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.530
 it was yes good this rolls and whole 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.550
 15 present a lot for a thousand times 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.659
 the years a design for how to see 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.050
 they are giants and I also bought this two 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:32.430
 plates this is the first one in this 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.990
 brand that is a Chinese brand of the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.479
 purchase for pure output when I am 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.830
 in my house that makes it practically a 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:43.319
 only once and they do not last anything the truth is 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.629
 she is more alone when she puts on a glaze 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.180
 silicon jump the next day good 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:51.090

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.479
 more and this good not a lot but what 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.490
 what to use for you to protect design 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.379
 not because it does not last but for example for 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.629
 day to day and like that and I'm going to use it 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.030
 when you have no other glazes and 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.610

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.820
