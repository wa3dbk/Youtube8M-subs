00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
have this as my bomb screams with

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.980 
have this as my bomb screams with
talonflame<00:00:17.699> with<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> flame<00:00:18.480> body<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.840> fly

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
talonflame with the flame body and fly

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.769 
talonflame with the flame body and fly
of<00:00:19.170> course<00:00:19.380> five<00:00:19.680> eggs<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.510> I'm<00:00:21.510> actually

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
of course five eggs and I'm actually

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.410 
of course five eggs and I'm actually
hatching<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> feed<00:00:22.710> bass<00:00:22.859> right<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
hatching a feed bass right now so you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.820 
hatching a feed bass right now so you
can<00:00:24.570> see<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> whole<00:00:25.199> batch<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.410> eggs<00:00:25.650> you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
can see I have a whole batch of eggs you

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.589 
can see I have a whole batch of eggs you
guys<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.250> probably<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the first the first few got a closer to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
the first the first few got a closer to
hatching<00:00:31.199> because<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:33.620> because<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.850> walking

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
hatching because of because of walking

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
hatching because of because of walking
around<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> eggs<00:00:36.480> good<00:00:37.110> yeah<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.770> I'm

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
around to get the eggs good yeah so I'm

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.869 
around to get the eggs good yeah so I'm
just<00:00:38.129> gonna<00:00:38.280> fly<00:00:38.640> over<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:40.309> lumiose<00:00:41.309> city<00:00:41.340> over

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
just gonna fly over to lumiose city over

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
just gonna fly over to lumiose city over
here<00:00:42.030> by<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> prison<00:00:42.510> tower<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.579> so

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.830 
here by the prison tower and so
basically<00:00:49.340> what<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> you're

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
use this what's it called a folded

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
use this what's it called a folded
chopstick<00:00:59.870> paper<00:01:00.870> thing<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
chopstick paper thing and then I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.700 
chopstick paper thing and then I
actually<00:01:02.160> put<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.750> thing<00:01:04.470> but

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
actually put it in the thing but

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
actually put it in the thing but
personally<00:01:05.309> okay<00:01:05.580> them<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.820> front<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.150> bike

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
personally okay them in front of my bike

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.490 
personally okay them in front of my bike
and<00:01:06.830> then<00:01:07.830> walk<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.930> circle<00:01:10.320> here

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and then walk to the the circle here

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.859 
and then walk to the the circle here
because<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.630> go

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
because as you can see you can go

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.399 
because as you can see you can go
infinitely<00:01:13.380> around<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:15.390> stop<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.869> thought

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
infinitely around and not stop I thought

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
infinitely around and not stop I thought
you<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.619> hit<00:01:16.799> anything<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.830> I'm<00:01:19.830> gonna<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it's still morning so uh just for the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's still morning so uh just for the
sake<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> video<00:01:26.490> I'm<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.759> gonna<00:01:27.000> show

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
sake of this video I'm just gonna show

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
sake of this video I'm just gonna show
I'm<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.930> gonna<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.320> hatching<00:01:28.890> power<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I'm just gonna use out hatching power to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.230 
I'm just gonna use out hatching power to
make<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> little<00:01:29.579> faster<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> hatch<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
make it a little faster to hatch the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.609 
make it a little faster to hatch the
eggs<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:31.140> yeah<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.130> usually<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.030> would<00:01:33.290> walk<00:01:34.290> or

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
eggs but yeah so usually I would walk or

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.830 
eggs but yeah so usually I would walk or
if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> don't<00:01:35.130> want<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> walk<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:36.479> just

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
if you don't want to walk then just

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
if you don't want to walk then just
slide<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.740> something<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.880> leg<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
slide with do something your leg for a

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.520 
slide with do something your leg for a
little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.079> basically<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
little bit but then so basically what I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.910 
little bit but then so basically what I
do<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.710> uh<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.540> just<00:01:42.540> kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.960> shove<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.590> paper

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
do is uh I just kind of shove this paper

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.569 
do is uh I just kind of shove this paper
in<00:01:44.189> there

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
in there

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.350 
in there
and<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.810> see<00:01:46.140> perpetual<00:01:46.799> movement<00:01:47.360> not

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and you can see perpetual movement not

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
and you can see perpetual movement not
perpetual<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.640> consistent

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
perpetual but you know consistent

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.639 
perpetual but you know consistent
infinite<00:01:51.509> movement<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.939> if<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.899> lot<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> people

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
infinite movement so if a lot of people

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.880 
infinite movement so if a lot of people
I<00:01:55.680> know<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> dimes<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
I know you dimes I know for the the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
I know you dimes I know for the the
regular<00:01:59.250> yes<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.149> naughty<00:02:00.810> Excel<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.590> can

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
regular yes the naughty Excel you can

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.959 
regular yes the naughty Excel you can
actually<00:02:02.100> use<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> dime<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> lot

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
actually use a dime and it's a lot

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.160 
actually use a dime and it's a lot
easier

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
easier

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.830 
easier
oopsie<00:02:04.920> already<00:02:05.369> hashed<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:05.700> first<00:02:05.909> egg<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
oopsie already hashed my first egg and
