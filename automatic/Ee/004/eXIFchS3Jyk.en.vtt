can see it's unlabeled and it makes made
up<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> series<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.469> ridges<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.129> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
up of a series of ridges here if we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.869 
up of a series of ridges here if we
activate<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.450> phone<00:00:43.940> unlocking<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.030> first

see<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> numbers<00:00:48.239> light<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> keypad

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
see the numbers light up on the keypad

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.650 
see the numbers light up on the keypad
thing<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.590> he<00:00:49.680> what's<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.219> these<00:00:51.180> ridges

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
thing is he what's going on these ridges

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
thing is he what's going on these ridges
now<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:53.250> bar<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.879> those<00:00:54.000> three

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
now are all one bar so those three

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
now are all one bar so those three
buttons<00:00:54.510> per<00:00:54.719> bar<00:00:55.020> they're<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> little<00:00:56.280> close

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
buttons per bar they're a little close

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.569 
buttons per bar they're a little close
but<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.480> try<00:00:58.170> using<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.770> tip<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.550> your

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
but if you try using the tip of your

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.459 
but if you try using the tip of your
finger<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.000> opposed<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:00.930> fingernail

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
finger as opposed to you know fingernail

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.630 
finger as opposed to you know fingernail
or<00:01:01.590> something<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.309> works

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
or something like that it actually works

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.729 
or something like that it actually works
okay<00:01:03.090> takes<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.629> getting<00:01:03.750> used<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
okay takes a little getting used to and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
okay takes a little getting used to and
it<00:01:05.189> definitely<00:01:05.519> could<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.670> done<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it definitely could have done with a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.240 
it definitely could have done with a
little<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.930> space<00:01:07.229> between<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.830> Rosalie's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
little more space between the Rosalie's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
little more space between the Rosalie's
for<00:01:08.400> somebody<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.790> large<00:01:09.240> hands<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.750> me<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
for somebody with large hands like me it

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520 
for somebody with large hands like me it
works<00:01:10.830> pretty<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.400> general<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:13.170> d-pad

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
works pretty well in general the d-pad

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.820 
works pretty well in general the d-pad
on<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> end<00:01:13.920> 78<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.340> fairly<00:01:14.520> straightforward

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
on the end 78 is fairly straightforward

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.690 
on the end 78 is fairly straightforward
works<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.310> expect<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
works like you would expect the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
works like you would expect the
traditional<00:01:18.150> d-pad<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> work<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.049> also

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
traditional d-pad to work but it also

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.340 
traditional d-pad to work but it also
has<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> built<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.369> Navi<00:01:20.610> control<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.420> touch
