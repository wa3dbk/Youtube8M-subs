00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the banners is a really really a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.819 
the banners is a really really a
time-consuming<00:00:34.920> process<00:00:35.149> sometimes<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.960> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
time-consuming process sometimes so this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.700 
time-consuming process sometimes so this
one<00:00:38.370> command<00:00:38.790> essentially<00:00:39.510> builds<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.820> little

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
one command essentially builds a little

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
one command essentially builds a little
generator<00:00:43.710> oh<00:00:44.070> my<00:00:44.910> goodness<00:00:47.360> okay<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.420> this

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
generator oh my goodness okay so this

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.830 
generator oh my goodness okay so this
this<00:00:48.930> command<00:00:49.649> builds<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.969> generator

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
this command builds a little generator

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.569 
this command builds a little generator
that<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.440> create<00:00:54.170> these<00:00:55.399> banners<00:00:56.399> really

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that will create these banners really

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
that will create these banners really
quickly<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
quickly so what you have is you have a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
quickly so what you have is you have a
spawn<00:00:59.070> banner<00:00:59.340> chest<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> destroy<00:01:00.149> banner

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
spawn banner chest and destroy banner

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.930 
spawn banner chest and destroy banner
chests<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> put<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.250> banner<00:01:02.550> chest

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
chests so if you put down a banner chest

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.260 
chests so if you put down a banner chest
anywhere<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.870> will<00:01:04.110> spawn<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> chest<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> any

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
anywhere it will spawn a chest and any
