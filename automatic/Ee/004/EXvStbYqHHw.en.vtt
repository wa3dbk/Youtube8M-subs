after<00:01:26.039> Charlotte<00:01:26.430> died<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.880> left<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> island<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
after Charlotte died I left the island I

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.289 
after Charlotte died I left the island I
used<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> Dharma<00:01:29.189> facilities<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.850> Ann<00:01:30.119> Arbor

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
used the Dharma facilities in Ann Arbor

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.050 
used the Dharma facilities in Ann Arbor
to<00:01:30.840> recreate<00:01:31.229> my<00:01:31.409> entire<00:01:31.710> life's<00:01:32.039> work<00:01:32.219> for

to recreate my entire life's work for

to recreate my entire life's work for
three<00:01:33.450> years<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.530> stared<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.429> these<00:01:36.210> equations

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
three years I stared at these equations

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.539 
three years I stared at these equations
again<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.170> again<00:01:37.350> again<00:01:37.619> until<00:01:38.189> finally

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
again and again again until finally

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.059 
again and again again until finally
realized<00:01:40.610> I've<00:01:41.610> been<00:01:41.880> spending<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.479> much<00:01:42.659> time

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
realized I've been spending so much time

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:50.959 
realized I've been spending so much time
focused<00:01:44.069> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.360> constants<00:01:49.759> did<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.880> know

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
focused on the constants did you know

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:51.950 
focused on the constants did you know
what<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> variables<00:01:51.539> in<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:51.780> equations

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
what the variables in these equations

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.820 
what the variables in these equations
are<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:53.750> know<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.289> know<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> don't<00:01:55.789> us<00:01:57.679> we're<00:01:58.679> the

we accept that we can't can't change the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.139 
we accept that we can't can't change the
past<00:02:07.979> can't<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.399> anything<00:02:08.579> about<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.060> we

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
past can't do anything about it then we

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
past can't do anything about it then we
don't<00:02:09.239> even<00:02:09.420> bother<00:02:09.539> trying<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.829> we

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
don't even bother trying but if we

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.130 
don't even bother trying but if we
decide<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.660> believe<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.640> change

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
decide if we believe that we can change

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:27.959 
decide if we believe that we can change
the<00:02:16.140> past<00:02:20.989> then<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.019> don't<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:22.380> paddles

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:35.890 

we<00:02:28.969> use<00:02:29.120> both<00:02:29.329> us<00:02:34.689> sir

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
we use both us sir

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.679 
we use both us sir
coz<00:02:36.769> if<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:36.980> drop<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> big<00:02:37.519> enough<00:02:37.700> rock<00:02:38.060> into<00:02:38.659> a

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
coz if you drop a big enough rock into a

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.199 
coz if you drop a big enough rock into a
creek<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.140> create<00:02:39.500> one<00:02:39.709> down<00:02:40.189> right<00:02:40.609> and<00:02:41.090> then

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
creek you create one down right and then

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.020 
creek you create one down right and then
that<00:02:41.359> Creek<00:02:43.209> changes<00:02:45.609> we're<00:02:46.609> not<00:02:46.730> talking

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
that Creek changes we're not talking

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.649 
that Creek changes we're not talking
about<00:02:47.090> throwing<00:02:47.420> rocks<00:02:47.689> into<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.049> creek<00:02:48.349> really

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
about throwing rocks into a creek really

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.990 
about throwing rocks into a creek really
that's<00:02:50.659> right<00:02:51.069> so<00:02:52.069> what<00:02:52.280> are<00:02:52.519> we<00:02:52.849> talking

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
that's right so what are we talking

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.039 
that's right so what are we talking
about<00:02:53.209> exactly

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
about exactly

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.229 
about exactly
little<00:02:55.040> over<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.220> day<00:02:55.430> from<00:02:55.579> now<00:02:55.639> the<00:02:55.819> Dharma

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
little over a day from now the Dharma

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.420 
little over a day from now the Dharma
folks<00:02:56.269> at<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.750> Swan<00:02:56.900> website<00:02:57.590> they're<00:02:58.340> gonna

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
folks at the Swan website they're gonna

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.610 
folks at the Swan website they're gonna
drill<00:02:58.760> into<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.030> ground<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:00.049> accidentally

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
drill into the ground and accidentally

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.920 
drill into the ground and accidentally
tap<00:03:00.709> into<00:03:01.129> a<00:03:01.159> massive<00:03:01.250> pocket<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.750> energy<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
tap into a massive pocket of energy the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.599 
tap into a massive pocket of energy the
result<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> release<00:03:06.889> of<00:03:07.069> this<00:03:07.189> energy

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
result of the release of this energy

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.259 
result of the release of this energy
would<00:03:07.760> be<00:03:07.989> catastrophic<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.310> in<00:03:10.849> order<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
would be catastrophic so in order to

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.390 
would be catastrophic so in order to
contain<00:03:11.689> it<00:03:11.900> they're<00:03:12.560> gonna<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.829> to<00:03:12.889> cement

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
contain it they're gonna have to cement

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.339 
contain it they're gonna have to cement
the<00:03:13.579> entire<00:03:13.909> area<00:03:14.269> in<00:03:14.659> like<00:03:14.930> Chernobyl

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349

us belong here in the first place

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.240 
us belong here in the first place
I<00:04:25.980> think<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.490> negate<00:04:27.640> that<00:04:27.880> energy<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:29.250> think

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
I think I can negate that energy I think

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.620 
I think I can negate that energy I think
I<00:04:30.460> can<00:04:30.610> destroy<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.770> can<00:04:33.450> then<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.480> hatch

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
I can destroy if I can then that hatch

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.760 
I can destroy if I can then that hatch
will<00:04:34.900> never<00:04:35.320> be<00:04:35.620> built<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.220> your<00:04:36.730> plane

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
will never be built and your plane

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.100 
will never be built and your plane
they're<00:04:38.770> playing<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.160> land<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.960> like<00:04:40.960> he's

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
they're playing the land just like he's

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.570 
they're playing the land just like he's
supposed<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:41.820> no<00:04:42.820> no<00:04:42.940> circles<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:45.340> that

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
supposed to no no circles and that

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.290 
supposed to no no circles and that

no<00:04:46.750> baby<00:04:47.230> sense<00:04:48.180> and

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.499 

and<00:05:01.069> just<00:05:01.280> how<00:05:01.460> exactly<00:05:01.970> do<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.210> plan<00:05:02.389> on

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
and just how exactly do you plan on

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.350 
and just how exactly do you plan on
destroying<00:05:02.840> this<00:05:03.319> energy<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:06.789> think<00:05:07.789> that<00:05:08.150> need

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
destroying this energy I think that need

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.020 
destroying this energy I think that need
a<00:05:08.389> hydropower
