00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.720
 here is the test of youtube today 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.939
 it's about aprons for bicycles and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.689
 Now I'll show you where from 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.689
 buy comes 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.649
 and the tin for the full rath that gives 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.260
 it costs 9 98 at amazon and is 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.199
 free shipping 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.000
 the flash for the back wheel that can 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.219
 you also buy at Amazon and there are 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.979
 It's 26 inches in various sizes 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:07.700
 28 29 inches or 29 inches costs from 17 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:09.750
 euro 90 +4 euro 90 shipping costs 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 Alternatively, there is the sheet metal too 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.369
 in 26 27 5 inches to 1995 and the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.380
 shipping costs fall and that's why it is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.759
 a bit cheaper 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.860
 Here we still have the bag I 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.649
 at the end of the video just to introduce 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.229
 It is now in size L and costs 19 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.179
 euro for 90 without shipping costs 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.990
 who wants to pack a bit more 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.640
 buys the xl model for 22 euros and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.950
 free shipping again 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.720
 the links to the products in the text box 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.759
 under the video clip on it comes directly 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.149
 and now I show you the products 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.310
 times 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.979
 and always the two at the same time 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.159
 shows it very briefly 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.609
 this is this export that is here 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.609
 ahead 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.829
 You can get that out of here and then 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 you can just stop the setting as 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.990
 width of the frame is simply 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.740
 Here we have so pure 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.560
 still here so two rubber bands are the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.590
 attached down here so you can 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.530
 Length different places fastened 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.000
 then just done and then 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.010
 will be here depending on that again 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.200
 once the length just needs it here 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.690
 pure cut and endures really good 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.600
 that's right up front that 's the one here 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.000
 Very well processed on the back. Very stable 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.750
 everything here you can the flash 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.359
 adjust 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.590
 So you can ring so ever here 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.100
 after how you want it 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.950
 once here and then on the side 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.360
 you can always move that yes and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.550
 This will be here afterwards 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.470
 it is already 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.860
 that'll make me so clean with it 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.990
 there is a bit more solid here 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.020
 to make it that high and then you can 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:07.160
 hold the width of the saddle 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.380
 So adjust the how thick the thing 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.120
 here is still rubberized rubberized 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.910
 surface so that it keeps better 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.120
 yes then clicks one that is as simple as 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.920
 too and that's why the bike 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 then simply snapped and then 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 It's hard to do so 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.990
 Let's take the front and that 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.980
 wider part comes to the back 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.620
 That's easy to hear here 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.050
 set here can be seen as a buffer so 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.080
 you have to have this rubber band here 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.370
 Then you pull a bit like that 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.690
 down here through the little research 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.770
 then you just have to grab it 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.830
 and then just down here 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.750
 make rubber stuffing clean and that's it 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:01.800
 it firmly makes the same federal then for 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:06.030
 the other one here so fast 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.160
 through war and then just again 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.880
 look down here 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.100
 and that was already and as I said 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.190
 it is fixed and the stops 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.590
 bombenfest 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.900
 That's how old it looks good 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.960
 that I recognize a bit below 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.960
 So there are these committee gac 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.960
 in it 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.370
 now come out of the rear apron 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.030
 For this you have to first this summer 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.730
 open up and thereby you can 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.470
 then vary the length of the spell 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.060
 So you have to adjust this way 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.250
 that he afterwards if he makes this, 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.420
 pressure on it to get that there still holds 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.500
 I have already made 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.190
 that means I believe that back here too 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.280
 now I have this here 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.720
 rubber buffer in it then look to know 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.450
 get as exactly do I do that now 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.220
 just here it is 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:15.540
 this is just going to be a little bit 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.390
 awkward here made it so pure that it 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.280
 So it fits in here so you should 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.370
 straight 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.800
 So you can be here in front and then 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.250
 that just squeezed like that 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.920
 and that's it already and 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.900
 now you see splash is on it 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.810
 And as I said that you can then here 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.690
 make it down again and then here 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.090
 also adjust again without that is 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.590
 I think is a great thing 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.470
 who is interested in the two 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.700
 areas link to the product the text field 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.440
 under the video war on it comes 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.440
 directly in I also have in mine 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.500
 videos lamps once presented these 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.040
 by smart and then this one here 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.330
 chain I make the same time the left there 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.660
 get on it then he comes to the 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:08.880
 videos and alternatively here in front of 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:10.530
 sigma such a small bicycle lamp that 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.490
 was again the title of youtube and 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.480
 then we should wait until the next video 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.230
 Of course I forgot 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.980
 I wanted to hit you one 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:23.100
 Show bike bag and here of 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.300
 You can go back here like this 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.640
 turn it on 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.290
 But at the time I did it all right 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.600
 because of my taillights so that the 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.440
 bmi still sees cable ties 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.960
 attached and endures really great without there 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.120
 fits very much in you can 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.490
 ever expand so here is one 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.490
 small tip if you are covered 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.210
 she narrower 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.599
 and there you can hold all kinds of stuff and 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.800
 already show team 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:07:00.210
 gloves in there 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:02.530
 handkerchiefs pump spray key 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.210
 here's another bag up here 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.639
 there you can also have two three 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.470
 Doors provided eleven batteries at the 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.740
 I have his trend of many lamps then 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.919
 even a first aid pack here 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.330
 in it and that 's it already had been 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.490
 and I think that's a great thing if 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.780
 you look for a little bag for that 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.780
 to make the bike front
