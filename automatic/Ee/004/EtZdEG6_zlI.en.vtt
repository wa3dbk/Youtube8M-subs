00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.060
 Halli hello this is a little tutorial 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.069
 for you of the idealist unfortunately today 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.050
 not there was the visit and better 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 to do 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 Anyway, this is a little tutorial 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.920
 for you because some of you asked 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.300
 Like her you have the ultimate camera hand 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.619
 I think I can do it now 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.080
 play can pronounce 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.760
 what do you need for it so you need 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.410
 definitely steam on the web 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.980
 I am also there you can find the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.570
 download for free and you can 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.570
 then there are all kinds of games 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.510
 Download and buy because that's it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.950
 not everything for free 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.379
 Anyway, I am now in the normal 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.670
 browser he just gives in the search 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.440
 I have already presented it 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.360
 namely the device has tried gerry 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.680
 spot 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.260
 I still like it with it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 everyone is there because he is in traffic 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.620
 on 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.840
 and then everyone gets search results 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 and that did not need grandmother new 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 that it is free but that brings 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.570
 nothing because that is an outdated version 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.789
 meanwhile we have it at 13 yes 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.510
 Since we have 13 it costs 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.310
 but normal 99 so its normal price you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 But you can do it the way I did 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.200
 I'll wait until it's one of those 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.330
 many steam actions give it that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 then maybe only play 240 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 costs or so who knows so and then 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.460
 We designed it with has so long 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 Thanks God, nothing took away enough 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.299
 my pc so we go to addons and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.840
 subscribed to see all the game modes 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.490
 childish and maps weapons et cetera you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 you want to subscribe already you down 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.900
 Where is she? 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 can turn off and install 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 I have with her ultimate camera hand 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.229
 So you have to play the first one 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.940
 download game mode you will find 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.369
 just in advance and then it goes 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.250
 easy on game modes and I believe in 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.470
 easiest one finds ultimate camera 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.060
 Hand if you rated on the best 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.950
 Of course you can also click it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.780
 while analysis or latest search though 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.210
 at the best rated is ultimate 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.920
 Camera hand already in second place 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.070
 Then you just get on 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.119
 install so with me that was just 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.590
 pretty fast now because of me 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.380
 of course the files already on mine 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 computer usually stands then 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.290
 below just downloading ultimate camera 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 hand or something else so if we 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 click on subscribed now 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.230
 that she is hand to me and my camera 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.709
 in our community there is a positive backdrop 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.120
 In 1924, as my guests, if you were 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.120
 you just want to play the game 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.269
 to find multiplayer game and now 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.280
 we will welcome forever has a bit 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.270
 patience it really takes a long time for the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.850
 ultimate camera come to server 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.740
 we have them so well you recognize them 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.360
 also to the icann would not have to wear 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.700
 extra read everything just looks 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.770
 that she sees the oicker looks 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.870
 you then on it and there you can not in the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.420
 observer but eventually a third 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.110
 a lot of what seems okay and we are the one 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.000
 server in it 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.490
 a problem but now anyway 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.070
 Many of you will have if you only 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.970
 these two steps make the game 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.400
 to install 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.900
 you'll probably be out everywhere 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.290
 have as or maybe become one 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.330
 water dispensers stand but 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.790
 water levels therefore exactly the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.910
 Water level water dispensers are just so 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.070
 errors and perhaps to take the and 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.270
 city ​​of all sorts of things because 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.800
 the game is pretty colorful many questions 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.900
 Now sure why I've got through 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.300
 the game mode why are errors everywhere 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.330
 ok so I can explain that , I want 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.390
 explain briefly how gary smith 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.130
 in general, this mode works 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.960
 maybe some of you will know 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.970
 also the old games played along 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.680
 have the sandbox where you just look 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.190
 Build anything for all sorts of things 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.380
 can 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.170
 Now I want to explain the problem to you 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.540
 why he awakens and when we enter 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.280
 menu data go up to you 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.500
 opens because many things will happen to him 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.110
 then you have to see that's all there is to it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.100
 The items in Gary Smart 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.490
 are included 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.020
 These are the half-life I think 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.790
 I'm not sure if that really is 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.890
 all of half life but are most 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.220
 Anyway, it's probably everywhere 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.690
 These errors that I have there then 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.489
 apparently not all are so helped 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.460
 life does not matter 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.820
 the arrows are because you are the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.910
 Items not on the pc have the 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.860
 ultimate camera hand used as well 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.600
 Items that are included as well 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.320
 items from the game team fortress 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.800
 2 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.070
 For example , I can also use the pops and 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.230
 just such barrels or any 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.970
 of these objects become the 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.500
 Example in Olpe with camera on hand 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.530
 if we use it for example 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.510
 Therefore girls would take this now 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.070
 hat in any map of ultimate 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.960
 Camera hand, it could not do that 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.690
 represent you would have a huge 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.110
 arrow world this file is not on yours 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.669
 pc it waffles so long enough there is 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.180
 An easy way to solve this problem 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.780
 you can just go back in 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:14.370
 enter the shop and enter the search 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.990
 team fortress 2 so the game from which 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.760
 are the objects and you can see there 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.250
 already there is free-to-play because it is 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.070
 Free to play free to play means so much 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.250
 but how you can do that has the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.690
 one or the other restriction so we 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.460
 So this game has on the computer 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.930
 Do you need something with me now? 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.430
 stop in the case games start 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.410
 just click on install and you 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.600
 download the game respect it is 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.880
 pretty big if you wanted it 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.440
 but if the ultimate camera allude 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.840
 you wanted to do that unfortunately 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.820
 now another way 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.110
 the files should not be included 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.460
 all know for sure whether the are legal 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.500
 that is also the problem that many at 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.229
 The terrorists have them 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.880
 do not even see or hear the weapons 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.690
 this is what you need in the counter strike 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.860
 source 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.870
 Well, I hope 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.780
 this tutorial was a little help 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.939
 for you if I forget something 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.069
 should not have something for them 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.710
 The US media have come to the end 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.270
 to write if it really is 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.789
 I was able to do it in one 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.560
 mention the note and if it's something 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.689
 was what has just been said again 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.939
 can you answer that calmly 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:25.520
 I'm talking understood to videos 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.960
 have you can against you and one 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.729
 if not help them a bit 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.650
 understood or so and as said 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.529
 you can always ask me anything 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.580
 when I actually just answer 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:38.960
 thing is not where I think to myself 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.560
 say I still had all the cups in 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.139
 wardrobe 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.000
 I think you know what we are about 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.830
 So do not ask mine which ones where I am 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.110
 I think and he wants an answer 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.389
 thereon 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.650
 no matter what, first of all me 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.960
 unfortunately can not say if again 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.250
 As I said, videos are both 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.259
 currently a bit busy but yes 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.930
 we'll see each other videos again 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.289
 until then and I hope I could 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.289
 help
