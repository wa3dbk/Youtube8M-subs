 they are just as important as everything 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.460

 when you think about getting some glasses 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.320
 of sun you should consider its quality and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.969
 always buy them in optics 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.570
 authorized and not in another type of 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.570
 shops 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.460
 here was in my advice the glasses 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.680
 they should always be chosen depending on 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.960
 your face for example if your face is 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.180
 round then choose some lenses 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.730
 sun that have a more square shape or 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.710
 more angular and if your face is square 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.909
 then choose a model that has 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.609
 certain colors 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.859
 Sunglasses should be comfortable 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.229
 in the face without falling or pressing 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.569
 and the pins should not be stuck in the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.390
 head but feel comfortable about 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.310
 ears you also have to consider the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.379
 size of the nose and the distance between 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.239
 your eyes because of this it will depend that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.510
 they fall and they do not move 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.510
 place 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.690
 with a lot of attention to this that never 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.520
 buy sunglasses on the street 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.490
 they are imitations of famous brands 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.280
 but of very poor quality to use it 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.900
 it means a risk to your eyes not you 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.209
 let yourself be carried away by the dark of the crystal 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.180
 because your eye becomes more sensitive to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.520
