00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:14.560
 I mean that yes hello this time I that function 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:21.040
 I've also got some Sayaka for this at Prize, so I would like to introduce that 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:25.740
 When I 'm going this time, I'm saying that this time it's a design that only Sayaka-Chan recognized 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:32.369
 Well I think that the degree of attention is very high 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:37.540
 It was very difficult to say that it was a devil even with a 200 yen setting . 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:44.410
 I also helped a little but it was difficult 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:50.280
 After all, I of pretty ne sq 3 by Tteyuu issue ne ne new this time Sayaka 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 I felt in the decollete of pretend Tiga NekoRaradenno Sayaka's 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.399
 Wow 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:03.670
 It is so overall 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:06.550
 After all quality is saved with last time s class beauty deer 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.370
 I wonder if it will not change 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:14.320
 I think the last thing is 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:21.060
 I'm sorry I can not compare but I can not 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:23.170
 Do Yes feel Edo three seen Hey Hey has become a little darker Do Ah door 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.689
 I think for a moment 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:32.659
 Poses and expressions are basically completely the same 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.960
 Another child who changed in this is a large snake here- 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.960
 Sayaka-chan is the base of this musical note motif 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.780
 I'm doing my best 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.300
 Naa was nice to still Hey Get 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.760
 I think yes I 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.760
 Don't do everything like Sayaka 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.760
 Entered it was for sale, Kyoko-chan 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.390
 yeah 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:13.780
 Also I would like a little to introduce more of it Kyoko-chan By Itteyuu 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.550
 Kyoko-chan also challenges a little more than that last time 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.250
 I wonder if coloring is slightly dark 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.400
 think 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.409
 Yes 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.409
 As Ryoko is quite difficult to assemble, please do your best if you are going to do it 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:37.290
 I Tteyuu rough is painted to be honest that last time I Kyoko-chan in Manet 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:42.460
 There was a lot of reviews, so I hated it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.340
 But it is pounding and tan when you open a little even this time it really worry 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.240
 The area is greatly improved 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.400
 Sounds good 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:58.000
 It was good 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:02.220
 My sister of the cat's head than even I Kyoko-chan Hanechotto 2-year-old places in looks like this 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.810
 How to bite the pants and wonder if there is a bit 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.030
 I thought that it was a bit weird but it was not good 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.900
 That overall not good coloring is very good 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.180
 Well of coarse phase 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.420
 I think I do not feel too much color shift I think yes 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.940
 It It is here the pedestal of in Kyoko-chan 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.050
 Yes before and after 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:37.010
 I wonder if some of the Toka Nami-san and Kawada minute tea cup 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:38.950

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.220

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.130
 Two people who fight in the main story feels like I am really 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.610
 I wanted to see 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.030

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.600
 Hmmm and Kyoko are faster 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.840
 Sayaka's last if it is clear 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.050
