hey guys baby here from boom Bop calm
and<00:00:08.760> necessary<00:00:09.240> we're<00:00:09.360> doing<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.750> benchmarking

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and necessary we're doing a benchmarking

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.680 
and necessary we're doing a benchmarking
on<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.860> HTC<00:00:11.429> One<00:00:11.670> X<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.210> case<00:00:12.269> it's

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
on the HTC One X in this case it's

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.010 
on the HTC One X in this case it's
prints<00:00:13.080> evo<00:00:13.469> 4g<00:00:13.920> LTE<00:00:14.340> variant<00:00:15.030> well<00:00:15.839> go<00:00:15.900> ahead

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
prints evo 4g LTE variant well go ahead

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.720 
prints evo 4g LTE variant well go ahead
and<00:00:16.109> start<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> benchmark<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.190> basically

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and start the benchmark and basically

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.070 
and start the benchmark and basically
what<00:00:17.850> I'll<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.150> I'll<00:00:18.240> start<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.779> then

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
what I'll do is I'll start it and then

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.420 
what I'll do is I'll start it and then
I'll<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.350> skip<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.890> results<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.340> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
I'll just skip to the results so you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.010 
I'll just skip to the results so you
guys<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.670> see<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.970> scores<00:00:21.270> I'm<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.930> be

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
guys can see the scores I'm going to be

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.470 
guys can see the scores I'm going to be
doing<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.350> ante<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.980> nano<00:00:23.460> mark<00:00:23.699> quadrant<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
doing the ante to nano mark quadrant and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.820 
doing the ante to nano mark quadrant and
limb<00:00:24.689> pack<00:00:24.869> benchmark<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.560> let's<00:00:25.680> go<00:00:25.769> ahead

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
limb pack benchmark so let's go ahead

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.540 
limb pack benchmark so let's go ahead
and<00:00:26.099> start<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.760> aunt<00:00:27.029> into<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.429> I'll<00:00:29.429> let

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and start with aunt into and I'll let

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.130 
and start with aunt into and I'll let
this<00:00:29.699> guy<00:00:29.849> load<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.660> I'll<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:30.840> go

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
this guy load up and then I'll just go

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770 
this guy load up and then I'll just go
ahead<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.380> skip<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.090> results<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.600> let's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
ahead and skip to the results so let's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:43.650 
ahead and skip to the results so let's
go<00:00:33.899> test<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.700> start<00:00:35.700> test

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.350 

you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 

alright<00:00:48.990> so<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> intensive<00:00:50.070> benchmark<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
alright so the intensive benchmark is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.440 
alright so the intensive benchmark is
done<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.060> scored<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.720> 69<00:00:52.260> 88<00:00:53.040> so<00:00:53.430> moving<00:00:54.150> this<00:00:54.270> up

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
done it scored a 69 88 so moving this up

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.860 
done it scored a 69 88 so moving this up
closer<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.870> camera<00:00:55.080> so<00:00:55.620> 69<00:00:56.100> 88<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.360> those

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
closer to camera so 69 88 and that those

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.550 
closer to camera so 69 88 and that those
are<00:00:57.990> the<00:00:58.080> scores<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.590> cpu<00:00:59.190> GPU<00:00:59.540> ram<00:01:00.560> there

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
are the scores for the cpu GPU ram there

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.130 
are the scores for the cpu GPU ram there
you<00:01:01.740> go<00:01:01.890> let's<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:02.850> ahead<00:01:02.880> and<00:01:03.030> run<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.630> next

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
you go let's go ahead and run the next

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.420 
you go let's go ahead and run the next
benchmark<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.890> i'll<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.070> ahead<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.250> now

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
benchmark so i'll go ahead and now

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820 
benchmark so i'll go ahead and now
actually<00:01:05.610> close<00:01:06.120> this<00:01:06.720> guy<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.680> let

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
actually close this guy out and just let

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually close this guy out and just let
you<00:01:07.950> guys<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.190> i<00:01:08.220> did<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> fresh<00:01:09.060> reboot

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you guys know i did do a fresh reboot

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
you guys know i did do a fresh reboot
before<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> started<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.890> video<00:01:11.280> so

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
before I started this video so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
before I started this video so
everything's<00:01:12.510> gonna<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.720> nice<00:01:12.870> even<00:01:13.050> we'll<00:01:13.260> go

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
everything's gonna be nice even we'll go

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
everything's gonna be nice even we'll go
ahead<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.650> quadrant<00:01:14.130> next<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:15.360> always

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
ahead and do quadrant next and I always

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920 
ahead and do quadrant next and I always
run<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> full<00:01:16.350> benchmark<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.510> again<00:01:18.510> skip<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
run the full benchmark and again skip to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.230 
run the full benchmark and again skip to
the<00:01:19.260> results

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.609 

also<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.479> quadrant<00:01:25.990> benchmark<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.439> done

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
also the quadrant benchmark is done

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.850 
also the quadrant benchmark is done
let's<00:01:26.830> go<00:01:26.890> ahead<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.100> hit<00:01:27.250> yes<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.770> you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
let's go ahead and hit yes and there you

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.859 
let's go ahead and hit yes and there you
go<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.040> got<00:01:30.159> our<00:01:30.340> results<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.390> time<00:01:31.600> it

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
go we got our results so this time it

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.320 
go we got our results so this time it
scored<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:33.750> 4797<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.100> we'll<00:01:36.700> go<00:01:36.820> ahead<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.030> go

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
scored a 4797 and we'll go ahead and go

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.300 
scored a 4797 and we'll go ahead and go
on<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.899> next<00:01:37.930> benchmark<00:01:38.710> which<00:01:39.040> is<00:01:39.189> going

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
on to the next benchmark which is going

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.550 
on to the next benchmark which is going
to<00:01:39.369> be<00:01:39.540> linpack<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:40.780> let's<00:01:40.990> go<00:01:41.080> ahead<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.290> open

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
to be linpack so let's go ahead and open

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.999 
to be linpack so let's go ahead and open
up<00:01:42.070> linpack<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.899> we'll<00:01:43.899> just<00:01:44.110> run<00:01:44.740> the

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
up linpack and we'll just run the

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.609 
up linpack and we'll just run the
multithread<00:01:45.759> five<00:01:46.479> times<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.049> kind<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.440> get

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
multithread five times so we kind of get

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.740 
multithread five times so we kind of get
an<00:01:48.520> idea<00:01:48.640> as<00:01:48.940> well<00:01:48.970> as<00:01:49.210> far<00:01:49.390> as<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.570> average

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
an idea as well as far as the average

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.310 
an idea as well as far as the average
score<00:01:50.259> so<00:01:50.530> we're<00:01:51.039> going<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.280> first<00:01:51.460> time

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
score so we're going to the first time

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:06.870 
score so we're going to the first time
so<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:53.409> got<00:01:53.560> 180<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:56.789> 188<00:01:59.759> 169<00:02:02.490> 176<00:02:05.340> 162<00:02:06.340> so

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
so we got 180 for 188 169 176 162 so

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.419 
so we got 180 for 188 169 176 162 so
basically<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.750> between<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.350> know<00:02:08.440> 162<00:02:09.130> and

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
basically it's between you know 162 and

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.479 
basically it's between you know 162 and
189<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.410> know<00:02:11.500> somewhere<00:02:11.739> around<00:02:11.860> 175

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
189 you know somewhere around 175

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.180 
189 you know somewhere around 175
probably<00:02:12.940> run<00:02:13.150> average<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:14.200> anyway<00:02:14.980> what's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
probably run average but anyway what's

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.840 
probably run average but anyway what's
running<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.519> more<00:02:15.670> time<00:02:16.830> 172<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:17.980> yeah<00:02:18.160> anyway

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
running one more time 172 so yeah anyway

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.340 
running one more time 172 so yeah anyway
that's<00:02:19.030> about<00:02:19.299> average<00:02:19.450> go<00:02:19.840> ahead<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.200> go<00:02:20.319> to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
that's about average go ahead and go to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.259 
that's about average go ahead and go to
the<00:02:20.650> next<00:02:20.830> benchmark<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.700> let's<00:02:21.819> close<00:02:22.030> this

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
the next benchmark so let's close this

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.039 
the next benchmark so let's close this
guy<00:02:22.480> out<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.110> let's<00:02:23.680> run<00:02:23.950> nano<00:02:24.730> mark

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
guy out and then let's run nano mark

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.670 
guy out and then let's run nano mark
this<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.110> mostly<00:02:26.530> testing<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.220> GPU<00:02:27.850> on<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
this is mostly testing the GPU on the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.680 
this is mostly testing the GPU on the
processor<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:29.829> let's<00:02:29.980> go<00:02:30.100> ahead<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.370> hit<00:02:30.790> run

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
processor so let's go ahead and hit run

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.270 
processor so let's go ahead and hit run
and<00:02:31.989> then<00:02:32.320> again<00:02:32.560> I'll<00:02:32.709> skip<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.280> result

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.190 

alright<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.489> Nana<00:02:40.940> mark<00:02:41.180> benchmark<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.959> done

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
alright so Nana mark benchmark is done

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.699 
alright so Nana mark benchmark is done
let's<00:02:42.410> go<00:02:42.470> ahead<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.890> back<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:44.000> scored<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.709> 58.9

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
let's go ahead and back we scored a 58.9

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.530 
let's go ahead and back we scored a 58.9
as<00:02:46.129> you<00:02:46.220> guys<00:02:46.370> can<00:02:46.580> see<00:02:46.640> right<00:02:47.000> over<00:02:47.030> here<00:02:47.360> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
as you guys can see right over here and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.050 
as you guys can see right over here and
that's<00:02:48.230> pretty<00:02:48.410> much<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.680> for<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.220> benchmarks

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
that's pretty much it for the benchmarks

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.690 
that's pretty much it for the benchmarks
on<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.330> guy<00:02:50.540> I'll<00:02:51.470> go<00:02:51.590> ahead<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.800> do<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> quick

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
on this guy I'll go ahead and do a quick

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.370 
on this guy I'll go ahead and do a quick
browser<00:02:53.330> benchmark<00:02:53.870> let's<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:56.380> html5

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
browser benchmark let's do the html5

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.050 
browser benchmark let's do the html5
test<00:02:59.530> all<00:03:00.530> right<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:00.980> guys<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.430> see<00:03:01.489> that

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
test all right so you guys can see that

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.039 
test all right so you guys can see that
it<00:03:02.300> scored<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.750> 270<00:03:03.680> out<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.519> 500<00:03:04.819> on<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.599> html5

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
it scored a 270 out of 500 on the html5

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.990 
it scored a 270 out of 500 on the html5
test<00:03:06.470> let's<00:03:06.650> go<00:03:06.769> ahead<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.069> do<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.700> browser

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
test let's go ahead and do the browser

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.690 
test let's go ahead and do the browser
mark<00:03:08.299> benchmark<00:03:09.250> alright<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.430> let's<00:03:10.549> go<00:03:10.640> ahead

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
mark benchmark alright so let's go ahead

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.460

and<00:03:10.879> run<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.299> browser<00:03:11.780> Moroi<00:03:11.989> benchmark

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
and run the browser Moroi benchmark

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.259 
and run the browser Moroi benchmark
let's<00:03:12.650> hit<00:03:12.830> run<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.310> skip<00:03:13.760> right<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.120> the

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
let's hit run and skip right to the

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.060 
let's hit run and skip right to the
