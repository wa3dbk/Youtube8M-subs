00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 so good afternoon to all of you today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.090
 about such an important thing as a paint 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.130
 scotch many can say that there 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 important masking tape adhesive tape and there is 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 scotch anything like scotch happens 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.640
 very different and yes on this object 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.470
 I had trouble here, but 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 very good plot for the video 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.750
 turned wall painted airless 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.320
 method and at the top 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:39.690
 up there is such a cornice 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:42.710
 girlfriend plaster before brighten 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.000
 I painted the wall from this eaves and 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 protecting it with such a painting tape 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 film began to paint the walls here in the very 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 can see scotch at some point 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.059
 moved away 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.910
 i.e. material amount of material 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.760
 on scotch turned out to be too big and in 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.990
 corner a little bit of it went and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.280
 I have painted the stucco therefore 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.930
 Now I will fix this joint at 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.049
 help here such masking tape 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.530
 tez company and more I analogs until 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.110
 I know it means it's masking tape she 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 different in that it can be glued on 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 delicate surface on some kind of thin 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 ply 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 and multilayered wallpapers on the fresh paint 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 there is this paint and age 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.530
 about a day it's still soft enough 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.420
 material and if i'm glue on some very 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.329
 durable tape then i most likely when 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.020
 I will dazzle him with him 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.020
 I would not like this paint 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.460
 need to use this tape means 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.630
 what else can you tell it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.950
 happen germany production 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.209
 7 days is recommended to keep the tape on 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.959
 no more surfaces 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.730
 but during these seven days 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.950
 the manufacturer guarantees that it is easy 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.040
 moving away from the surface without leaving glue 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.950
 the following in the Scotch line is yellow 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.010
 scotch is the most universal 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.230
 adhesive tape for interior work 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.180
 here the manufacturer guarantees that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.950
 for 5 months he will 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.150
 guaranteed to move well away from 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.060
 surfaces here but unfortunately 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.310
 scotch is quite expensive relative 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.519
 competitors that is, these here are 25 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.060
 two meters long scotch tape 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:54.180
 half a centimeter costs 148 rubles for 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.959
 today and there is still a third kind 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.680
 scotch tape 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.209
 this is blue scotch it applies for 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.840
 external works ie at work on 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.700
 the facade of this tape as far as I remember 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.459
 lasts 8 weeks on the surface and 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.079
 guaranteed to be removed without a trace and 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.190
 it is very much it is very important because 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.859
 what's the usual tape that sticks on 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.609
 the facade and it begins to affect 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:26.489
 sunlight with glue on rising 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.250
 temperature occurs such a process that 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.910
 he stick to the surface you this paper 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.620
 just don't take off with the help 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.380
 Well, as if in the usual way 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.180
 have to use some kind of special 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.740
 means to remove this 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.450
 scotch and now i want by the way still 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.890
 anti-advertising to make this tape 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.250
 which is sold in max house 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.440
 he is called his back is not very 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.090
 I recommend because this tape 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.250
 firstly it sticks poorly to 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.590
 surfaces that is, you apply it 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.250
 I wrap myself at the edge 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.690
 moves away 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:11.120
 but if he is long somewhere on the surface 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.940
 then it was very hard from 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.190
 She leaves there so I take it off 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.110
 see and he himself came off 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.060
 somehow not where I would like to 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.510
 same maxi house sold this one over 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.840
 a little yellow scotch folsom much 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:35.740
 behaves more adequately recommend 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:41.410
 so and a little off topic but 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.320
 interconnected when you need to create 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.520
 masking film from the surface we 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.850
 apply blade the sharpest blade is 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.700
 from the company olfa 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:05:00.140
 japan these black blade they are very and 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.760
 very high quality so many we 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.320
 lirah them specifically hunt for 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.810
 sorry again they are not sold 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.600
 everywhere though they are more expensive than others 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.010
 blades but they are worth it firstly 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.710
 go longer secondly sometimes no 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.460
 other blades you do not get for example 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:27.100
 here's how the effect 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:27.100
 here I take and cut 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:46.060
 masking tape here and so none 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:49.240
 other film blades 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.729
 I travel so unfortunately very 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.970
 I recommend using just these 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:58.139
 blades here on this i have everything today 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.139
 Thank you all for your attention
