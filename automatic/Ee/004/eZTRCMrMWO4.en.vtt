available in 2008 the dunnington is the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.210 
available in 2008 the dunnington is the
code<00:01:03.629> name<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.260> I'm<00:01:04.379> sure<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.010> have

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
code name for it I'm sure it will have

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
code name for it I'm sure it will have
some<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.600> sort<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> official

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
some other you know sort of official

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.510 
some other you know sort of official
name<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.799> actually<00:01:07.979> launched<00:01:08.400> but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
name when it's actually launched but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.240 
name when it's actually launched but
this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.939> refer<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.250> one

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this is what we refer to it as and one

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.590 
this is what we refer to it as and one
of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> things<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.970> think<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.360> really

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of the things that I think is really

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.010 
of the things that I think is really
important<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.369> well<00:01:14.369> cache<00:01:14.790> memory<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:15.360> cash

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
important is well cache memory now cash

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
important is well cache memory now cash
here<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.009> talking<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:17.400> money<00:01:17.759> what

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
here we're not talking about money what

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
here we're not talking about money what
we're<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.299> talking<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.650> know

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
we're really talking about is you know

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.469 
we're really talking about is you know
that<00:01:20.159> memory<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.729> sits<00:01:21.000> between<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that memory that sits between the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
that memory that sits between the
processor<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> main<00:01:22.560> memory<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.250> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
processor and main memory and so it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
processor and main memory and so it
really<00:01:23.939> speeds<00:01:24.240> things<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.200> get

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
really speeds things up if you can get

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
really speeds things up if you can get
the<00:01:25.619> working<00:01:26.040> set<00:01:26.250> size<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.759> whatever<00:01:27.330> you're

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the working set size of whatever you're

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.649 
the working set size of whatever you're
running<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> fit<00:01:28.560> within<00:01:28.740> cash<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
running to fit within cash so this is a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.050 
running to fit within cash so this is a
think<00:01:31.619> about<00:01:31.710> enterprise<00:01:32.220> applications<00:01:32.850> like

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
think about enterprise applications like

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
think about enterprise applications like
transaction<00:01:34.020> processing<00:01:34.470> databases

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
transaction processing databases

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
transaction processing databases
business<00:01:35.579> intelligence<00:01:36.020> enterprise<00:01:37.020> apps

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
business intelligence enterprise apps

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
business intelligence enterprise apps
and<00:01:38.640> even<00:01:38.970> some<00:01:39.119> high<00:01:39.240> performance<00:01:39.659> computing

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and even some high performance computing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.770 
and even some high performance computing
apps<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.369> scream<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.090> great<00:01:42.450> cache

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
apps can really scream with great cache

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.920 
apps can really scream with great cache
size<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:44.520> next<00:01:44.970> generation<00:01:45.240> Dunnington

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
size and this next generation Dunnington

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.740 
size and this next generation Dunnington
processor<00:01:46.439> actually<00:01:47.250> comes<00:01:47.490> across<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:48.060> 16

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

Meg<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.290> shared<00:01:50.280> last<00:01:50.729> level<00:01:50.970> cache<00:01:51.090> /<00:01:52.020> socket

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
Meg of shared last level cache / socket

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
Meg of shared last level cache / socket
so<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.070> means<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.119> same<00:01:54.329> silicon<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so that means on the same silicon that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.950 
so that means on the same silicon that
I've<00:01:55.380> got<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> processor<00:01:56.310> I've<00:01:56.640> got<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
I've got the processor I've got this you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
I've got the processor I've got this you
know<00:01:58.079> 16<00:01:58.500> mega<00:01:58.710> shared<00:01:59.130> inclusive<00:02:00.119> last<00:02:00.840> level

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.440 
know 16 mega shared inclusive last level
cache<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.829> what<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.700> these<00:02:02.880> applications<00:02:03.390> i

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
cache that what all these applications i

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
cache that what all these applications i
was<00:02:03.570> talking<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.229> scream<00:02:04.649> with

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
was talking about really scream with

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560 
was talking about really scream with
that<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.159> open<00:02:05.759> solaris<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.390> takes

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that and open solaris really takes

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
that and open solaris really takes
advantage<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.110> well<00:02:07.320> too<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.799> solaris

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
advantage of this well too and solaris

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.479 
advantage of this well too and solaris
also<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.869> fact<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.770> will<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.160> aware<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
also because in fact it will be aware of

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.570 
also because in fact it will be aware of
the<00:02:11.730> cash

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the cash

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.270 
the cash
and<00:02:12.700> because<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:13.990> know<00:02:14.080> we<00:02:14.200> work<00:02:14.410> with<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and because you know we work with the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.740 
and because you know we work with the
community<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.850> make<00:02:16.000> sure<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.420> it

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
community to make sure that it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.290 
community to make sure that it
recognizes<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.800> processor<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:19.090> then

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
recognizes this processor and can then

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.500 
recognizes this processor and can then
keep<00:02:19.900> threads<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.950> are<00:02:21.150> really<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.330> good

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
keep threads that are really have good

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.200 
keep threads that are really have good
cash<00:02:22.840> warmth<00:02:23.530> already<00:02:23.980> really<00:02:24.610> schedule<00:02:25.060> them

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
cash warmth already really schedule them

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.210 
cash warmth already really schedule them
with<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.870> cash<00:02:26.170> that's<00:02:26.470> warm<00:02:26.680> for<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
with that cash that's warm for it so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.520 
with that cash that's warm for it so
that's<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.240> really<00:02:28.450> great<00:02:28.600> advance<00:02:28.960> now<00:02:29.170> what

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
that's a really great advance now what

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.470 
that's a really great advance now what
else<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.860> look<00:02:30.100> for<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.520> think<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.270> good<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
else you look for I think it's good to

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.120 
else you look for I think it's good to
also<00:02:31.810> look<00:02:31.960> for<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> number<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.620> processors

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
also look for a number of processors

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.010 
also look for a number of processors
because<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:34.030> think<00:02:34.270> about<00:02:34.360> great

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
because if you think about great

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.510 
because if you think about great
enterprise<00:02:35.470> applications<00:02:36.280> great

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
enterprise applications great

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.730 
enterprise applications great
high-performance<00:02:37.180> computing<00:02:37.570> applications

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
high-performance computing applications

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.680 
high-performance computing applications
they're<00:02:38.740> already<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.250> multi-threaded<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.570> they

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
they're already a multi-threaded so they

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.200 
they're already a multi-threaded so they
take<00:02:40.930> advantage<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.620> more<00:02:42.580> processors<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
take advantage of more processors the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.670 
take advantage of more processors the
more<00:02:43.420> processors<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:43.960> can<00:02:44.080> throw<00:02:44.320> at<00:02:44.530> them

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
more processors you can throw at them

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.040 
more processors you can throw at them
well<00:02:45.550> threaded<00:02:45.880> applications<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:46.840> just

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
well threaded applications we are just

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.290 
well threaded applications we are just
going<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.230> run<00:02:47.410> faster<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.040> dunnington<00:02:49.000> here

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
going to run faster and dunnington here

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.680 
going to run faster and dunnington here
again<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.910> pretty<00:02:51.910> cool<00:02:52.000> because<00:02:52.300> this

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
again this is pretty cool because this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.730 
again this is pretty cool because this
actually<00:02:52.900> has<00:02:53.320> six<00:02:54.300> processors<00:02:55.300> per<00:02:56.080> piece<00:02:56.709> of

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
actually has six processors per piece of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.280 
actually has six processors per piece of
silicon<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.490> six<00:02:57.850> processors<00:02:58.450> processing

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
silicon so six processors processing

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.770 
silicon so six processors processing
cores<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.860> what<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.100> call<00:03:00.310> them<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:01.630> that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
cores is what we call them and so that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.280 
cores is what we call them and so that
means<00:03:02.020> for<00:03:02.590> every<00:03:03.150> socket<00:03:04.150> every<00:03:04.930> piece<00:03:05.110> of

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
means for every socket every piece of

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.290 
means for every socket every piece of
silicon<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.860> we<00:03:06.010> could<00:03:06.610> plug<00:03:06.790> into<00:03:07.030> our

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
silicon that we could plug into our

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.040 
silicon that we could plug into our
4-way<00:03:08.220> servers<00:03:09.220> will<00:03:10.120> have<00:03:10.270> six<00:03:10.540> processors

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
4-way servers will have six processors

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.740 
4-way servers will have six processors
so<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.650> means<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:12.130> fully<00:03:12.430> configured<00:03:13.209> for<00:03:13.540> way

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
so that means a fully configured for way

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.009 
so that means a fully configured for way
server<00:03:14.110> will<00:03:14.680> actually<00:03:15.100> have<00:03:15.480> 24<00:03:16.480> processors

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
server will actually have 24 processors

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.290 
server will actually have 24 processors
I<00:03:17.140> remember<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.890> old<00:03:18.100> days<00:03:18.250> were<00:03:18.550> used<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.209> be

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
I remember the old days were used to be

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.180 
I remember the old days were used to be
a<00:03:19.330> torn<00:03:19.570> apart<00:03:19.690> processor<00:03:20.320> multiprocessor

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
a torn apart processor multiprocessor

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.400 
a torn apart processor multiprocessor
system<00:03:21.489> was<00:03:21.690> incredibly<00:03:22.690> expensive<00:03:23.019> and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
system was incredibly expensive and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.500 
system was incredibly expensive and
complex<00:03:24.160> etc<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:24.820> this<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.390> know<00:03:25.480> a

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
complex etc and this is you know a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.860 
complex etc and this is you know a
high-volume<00:03:26.519> server<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.850> again<00:03:28.540> open

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
high-volume server and again open

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.479 
high-volume server and again open
solaris<00:03:29.200> will<00:03:29.500> work<00:03:29.800> really<00:03:30.010> well<00:03:30.100> with<00:03:30.250> this

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
solaris will work really well with this

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.130 
solaris will work really well with this
as<00:03:30.610> well<00:03:30.850> as<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> solaris<00:03:31.510> operating<00:03:31.630> system

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
as well as a solaris operating system

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.320 
as well as a solaris operating system
because<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.830> know<00:03:32.920> in<00:03:33.040> fact<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:34.030> knows

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
because you know in fact that it knows

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.000 
because you know in fact that it knows
the<00:03:34.660> number<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.140> processors<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.800> have

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
the number of processors that you have

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.930 
the number of processors that you have
and<00:03:36.250> can<00:03:36.459> again<00:03:36.780> schedule<00:03:37.780> processes

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and can again schedule processes

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.620 
and can again schedule processes
correctly<00:03:39.940> for<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.180> kind<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.390> architecture

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
correctly for this kind of architecture

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.930 
correctly for this kind of architecture
so<00:03:40.989> that's<00:03:41.140> that's<00:03:41.440> very<00:03:41.890> cool<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.790> other

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
so that's that's very cool the other

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.180 
so that's that's very cool the other
thing<00:03:43.180> that's<00:03:43.209> that's<00:03:43.720> good<00:03:43.930> here<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.530> there's

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
thing that's that's good here is there's

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.979 
thing that's that's good here is there's
some<00:03:45.340> new<00:03:45.459> virtualization<00:03:46.000> features<00:03:46.540> that

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
some new virtualization features that

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.320 
some new virtualization features that
will<00:03:47.110> really<00:03:47.290> speed<00:03:47.560> up<00:03:48.150> virtualization<00:03:49.150> so

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
will really speed up virtualization so

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.580 
will really speed up virtualization so
this<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.660> something<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.050> look<00:03:50.200> at<00:03:50.350> for<00:03:50.500> this

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
this is something to look at for this

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.650 
this is something to look at for this
platform<00:03:50.860> as<00:03:51.160> well<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:51.880> nice<00:03:52.060> target<00:03:52.390> for

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
platform as well it's a nice target for

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.970 
platform as well it's a nice target for
virtualizing<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.470> know<00:03:53.530> collect

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
virtualizing you know collect

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.320 
virtualizing you know collect
consolidating<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.880> bunch<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.150> servers

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
consolidating a bunch of servers

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.550 
consolidating a bunch of servers
together<00:03:55.800> also<00:03:56.970> this<00:03:57.970> uses<00:03:58.360> our<00:03:58.570> latest<00:03:59.290> you

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
together also this uses our latest you

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.400 
together also this uses our latest you
know<00:03:59.620> 45<00:04:00.160> nanometer<00:04:00.780> processing<00:04:01.780> technology

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
know 45 nanometer processing technology

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.380 
know 45 nanometer processing technology
now<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.980> know<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.100> know<00:04:03.940> your<00:04:04.150> kind<00:04:04.180> of

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
now I you know I know your kind of

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.520 
now I you know I know your kind of
wonder<00:04:04.630> why<00:04:04.900> does<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.110> make<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.440> difference

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
wonder why does that make a difference

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.500 
wonder why does that make a difference
from<00:04:05.890> a<00:04:06.010> software<00:04:06.400> standpoint<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:07.239> way<00:04:07.450> to

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
from a software standpoint the way to

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.750 
from a software standpoint the way to
think<00:04:07.720> about<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.410> that's<00:04:08.620> 45<00:04:09.519> nanometer

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
think about this is that's 45 nanometer

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.020 
think about this is that's 45 nanometer
distance<00:04:10.720> between<00:04:11.080> wires<00:04:11.860> on<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.670> silicon

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
distance between wires on the silicon

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.960 
distance between wires on the silicon
itself<00:04:13.420> now<00:04:13.900> why<00:04:14.140> that's<00:04:14.680> important<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.340> 45

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
itself now why that's important is 45

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.120 
itself now why that's important is 45
nanometers<00:04:16.419> means<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.290> get<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.799> lower

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
nanometers means that you get a lower

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.789 
nanometers means that you get a lower
power<00:04:18.459> consumption<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.269> 45<00:04:20.229> Danny<00:04:20.470> what's

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
power consumption and 45 Danny what's

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.590 
power consumption and 45 Danny what's
the<00:04:20.979> wavelength<00:04:21.520> of<00:04:21.669> light<00:04:21.729> for<00:04:22.240> crying<00:04:22.479> out

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
the wavelength of light for crying out

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.960 
the wavelength of light for crying out
loud<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.990> mean<00:04:23.350> yeah<00:04:23.500> this<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:23.919> fantastic<00:04:24.669> but

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
loud I mean yeah this is fantastic but

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.430 
loud I mean yeah this is fantastic but
this<00:04:25.090> really<00:04:25.270> actually<00:04:25.539> helps

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
this really actually helps

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.870 
this really actually helps
or<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.650> power<00:04:26.800> utilization<00:04:27.220> in<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.700> data

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
or the power utilization in the data

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.150 
or the power utilization in the data
center<00:04:28.150> it's<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.170> these<00:04:29.650> are<00:04:29.860> some<00:04:29.890> features

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
center it's so these are some features

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.120 
center it's so these are some features
to<00:04:30.520> think<00:04:31.120> about<00:04:31.420> as<00:04:31.660> you're<00:04:32.040> selecting<00:04:33.040> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
to think about as you're selecting a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.340 
to think about as you're selecting a
server<00:04:33.370> for<00:04:33.670> some<00:04:33.970> of<00:04:34.030> your<00:04:34.180> projects<00:04:34.750> what

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
server for some of your projects what

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.530 
server for some of your projects what
works<00:04:35.620> best<00:04:36.250> for<00:04:36.400> solaris<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.060> open<00:04:37.270> solaris

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
works best for solaris and open solaris

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.630 
works best for solaris and open solaris
why<00:04:38.080> let's<00:04:38.320> think<00:04:38.560> about<00:04:38.650> cash<00:04:39.100> let's<00:04:39.490> think

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
why let's think about cash let's think

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.820 
why let's think about cash let's think
about<00:04:39.700> number<00:04:40.150> of<00:04:40.210> processors<00:04:40.630> even<00:04:41.290> that<00:04:41.410> 45
