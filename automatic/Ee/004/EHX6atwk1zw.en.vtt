00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.920 
fire TV is the best option for you if
you<00:05:11.820> don't<00:05:12.000> have<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.120> Prime<00:05:12.300> membership<00:05:12.630> the

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
you don't have a Prime membership the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.230 
you don't have a Prime membership the
experience<00:05:13.410> is<00:05:13.530> not<00:05:13.710> as<00:05:13.950> fluid<00:05:14.460> it's<00:05:14.910> not<00:05:15.090> as

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
experience is not as fluid it's not as

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.850 
experience is not as fluid it's not as
quick<00:05:15.540> but<00:05:15.900> it's<00:05:16.020> still<00:05:16.140> a<00:05:16.200> pretty<00:05:16.440> decent<00:05:16.830> one

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
quick but it's still a pretty decent one

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.440 
quick but it's still a pretty decent one
while<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.700> was<00:05:17.880> in<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.060> middle<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.360> editing

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
while I was in the middle of editing

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.420 
while I was in the middle of editing
this<00:05:18.810> video<00:05:19.110> there's<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.530> few<00:05:19.830> more<00:05:19.980> points

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
this video there's a few more points

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.220 
this video there's a few more points
that<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.640> thought<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:20.970> should<00:05:21.120> bring<00:05:21.450> up<00:05:21.690> the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
that I thought I should bring up the

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.409 
that I thought I should bring up the
first<00:05:22.440> point<00:05:22.800> is<00:05:22.950> in<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.490> video<00:05:23.820> you'll<00:05:24.120> see

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
first point is in the video you'll see

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.420 
first point is in the video you'll see
that<00:05:24.630> when<00:05:24.780> I'm<00:05:24.870> casting<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.500> my<00:05:25.620> chromecast<00:05:26.220> I

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
that when I'm casting to my chromecast I

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.640 
that when I'm casting to my chromecast I
have<00:05:26.790> an<00:05:26.910> option<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.300> cast<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.050> fire<00:05:28.350> TV

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
have an option to cast to the fire TV

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.740 
have an option to cast to the fire TV
well<00:05:29.520> that<00:05:29.850> is<00:05:29.970> correct<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.450> can<00:05:30.600> actually

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
well that is correct you can actually

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.080 
well that is correct you can actually
cast<00:05:31.200> in<00:05:31.410> a<00:05:31.470> fire<00:05:31.680> TV<00:05:32.130> but<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.729> only<00:05:32.910> thing

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
cast in a fire TV but the only thing

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.520 
cast in a fire TV but the only thing
that<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.330> does<00:05:33.510> it<00:05:33.720> actually<00:05:33.840> launched<00:05:34.440> the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
that it does it actually launched the

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.740 
that it does it actually launched the
application<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.400> then<00:05:35.820> a<00:05:35.880> request<00:05:36.270> for<00:05:36.600> you

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
application and then a request for you

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.380 
application and then a request for you
to<00:05:36.780> link<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.410> account<00:05:37.830> with<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.790> fire<00:05:39.060> TV

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
to link the account with the fire TV

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.870 
to link the account with the fire TV
once<00:05:40.140> you<00:05:40.290> link<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.590> account<00:05:40.950> then<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.520> does

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
once you link the account then it does

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.240 
once you link the account then it does
work<00:05:42.210> sort<00:05:42.600> of<00:05:42.660> like<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:42.870> chromecast<00:05:43.260> except

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
work sort of like a chromecast except

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.400 
work sort of like a chromecast except
for<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.520> is<00:05:44.580> not<00:05:44.790> as<00:05:44.940> fluid<00:05:45.450> and<00:05:45.630> it's<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.140> little

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
for it is not as fluid and it's a little

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.500 
for it is not as fluid and it's a little
bit<00:05:46.530> clunky<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.250> it<00:05:47.460> just<00:05:47.790> really<00:05:48.030> has<00:05:48.240> some

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
bit clunky and it just really has some

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.630 
bit clunky and it just really has some
bugs<00:05:48.750> that<00:05:48.960> it<00:05:49.080> needs<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.380> iron<00:05:49.620> out<00:05:49.919> but<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.490> is

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
bugs that it needs to iron out but it is

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.430 
bugs that it needs to iron out but it is
possible<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.330> catch<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:51.900> it<00:05:51.990> directly<00:05:52.320> from

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
possible to catch to it directly from

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.100 
possible to catch to it directly from
your<00:05:52.890> phone<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.460> also<00:05:54.450> when<00:05:54.660> it<00:05:54.750> comes<00:05:54.780> to

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
your phone and also when it comes to

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.650 
your phone and also when it comes to
gaming<00:05:55.380> some<00:05:55.890> games<00:05:56.100> require<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:57.240> controller

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
gaming some games require the controller

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.180 
gaming some games require the controller
and<00:05:57.900> some<00:05:58.110> games<00:05:58.260> do<00:05:58.440> not<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:58.800> can<00:05:58.890> actually

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
and some games do not you can actually

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.219 
and some games do not you can actually
use<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.430> remote<00:05:59.760> as<00:06:00.000> your<00:06:00.510> controller<00:06:00.870> it

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
use the remote as your controller it

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.719 
use the remote as your controller it
actually<00:06:01.560> works<00:06:01.830> pretty<00:06:01.950> good<00:06:02.160> for<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.550> games

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
actually works pretty good for the games

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.760 
actually works pretty good for the games
that<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:02.970> tested<00:06:03.450> on<00:06:03.570> now<00:06:04.050> some<00:06:04.380> of<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.560> games

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
that I tested on now some of the games

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.350 
that I tested on now some of the games
like<00:06:05.040> the<00:06:05.190> first-person<00:06:05.610> shooters<00:06:06.120> do

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
like the first-person shooters do

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.120 
like the first-person shooters do
require<00:06:06.840> for<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.500> to<00:06:07.560> go<00:06:07.710> out<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:07.919> purchase

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
require for you to go out and purchase

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.750 
require for you to go out and purchase
that<00:06:08.400> controller<00:06:08.790> and<00:06:09.090> so<00:06:09.960> there<00:06:10.770> it<00:06:10.919> is<00:06:11.070> that

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
that controller and so there it is that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.080 
that controller and so there it is that
was<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.600> Google<00:06:12.960> chromecast<00:06:13.490> versus<00:06:14.490> the

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
was the Google chromecast versus the

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.770 
was the Google chromecast versus the
Amazon<00:06:15.600> fire<00:06:16.050> TV<00:06:16.470> now<00:06:17.460> as<00:06:17.669> always<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.330> just<00:06:18.360> give
