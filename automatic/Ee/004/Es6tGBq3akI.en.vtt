00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.750
 ah 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.550
 hello my name is felipe pÃ©rez i am 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.050
 part of physical education creation who 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.050
 we are going to present our section 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
 maybe you will ever hear someone 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.809
 say that when you went to buy a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.089
 milk or a product catches you you'll notice 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.070
 in the bottom of the package but that 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.680
 the bottom of the container at the bottom 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 of the container we can find four 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 digits of a total of five that are 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.890
 pre established by the company so 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.260
 which is a missing digit but that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.809
 means that I lack the fabric according to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.339
 the myth the missing digit means the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.899
 number of times the product has 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.750
 been returned to the company to be 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.880
 bidder hoisted for example if I am missing the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.590
 number 5 in my product means that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.470
 the room 5 times back to the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.929
 company to be processed but how much 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.270
 there are certain in this the numbers that are 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:16.979
 find more with the packaging means 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.409
 It dominates the number of which was 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.630
 factory for example be well base you 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.940
 missing the number 4 to say that it was 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 made in coil number four of the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.720
 five columns of all that has the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.700
 machine the machine that allows the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.530
 Product filling only accept 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.000
 two coil shape containers 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.490
 Therefore, if the others have 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.670
 used can not pass through 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.939
 this method 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.590
 therefore the myth is false as 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.560
 destination we can not deny or affirm 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.479
 pasteurization of milk but yes 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.600
 do you believe that it is contained in 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.520
 packaging and were very alive let's hope that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.799

 sapience of what they consume and
