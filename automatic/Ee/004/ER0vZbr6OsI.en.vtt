or if it even was special order
I<00:01:54.850> mean<00:01:55.210> it's<00:01:55.329> conceivable<00:01:55.719> to<00:01:56.109> think<00:01:56.409> that

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
I mean it's conceivable to think that

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.099 
I mean it's conceivable to think that
Ford<00:01:57.399> just<00:01:57.579> made<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.090> car<00:01:58.329> as<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.689> regular

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
Ford just made this car as a regular

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.080 
Ford just made this car as a regular
production<00:01:59.289> line<00:01:59.770> deal<00:02:00.009> but<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.700> don't<00:02:00.939> really

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
production line deal but I don't really

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.270 
production line deal but I don't really
think<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.569> I<00:02:01.840> think<00:02:02.170> because<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.009> bright

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
think so I think because of the bright

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.330 
think so I think because of the bright
Rangoon<00:02:04.179> red<00:02:04.829> exterior<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.130> black

Rangoon red exterior and the black

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.580 
Rangoon red exterior and the black
interior<00:02:06.819> and<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.630> hopped-up<00:02:07.810> drivetrain

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
interior and the hopped-up drivetrain

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
wearing disc brakes and the plans are to

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.010 
wearing disc brakes and the plans are to
convert<00:05:21.670> it<00:05:21.790> back<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.150> its<00:05:22.270> original<00:05:22.360> drums

convert it back to its original drums

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.290 
convert it back to its original drums
which<00:05:23.860> kind<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.340> seems<00:05:24.520> like<00:05:24.580> going<00:05:24.850> backwards

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
which kind of seems like going backwards

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.820 
which kind of seems like going backwards
but<00:05:25.870> when<00:05:25.990> there's<00:05:26.200> only<00:05:26.290> three<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.650> these

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
but when there's only three of these

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.740 
but when there's only three of these
ever<00:05:27.160> built

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
ever built

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.450

and<00:05:27.840> who<00:05:28.020> knows<00:05:28.200> how<00:05:28.440> many<00:05:28.500> left<00:05:28.860> in<00:05:28.920> existence

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
and who knows how many left in existence

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.460 
and who knows how many left in existence
I<00:05:29.670> think<00:05:30.030> it's<00:05:30.120> important<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.660> keep<00:05:30.840> at<00:05:31.170> least

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
I think it's important to keep at least

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:43.160 
I think it's important to keep at least
one<00:05:31.770> in<00:05:32.160> its<00:05:32.340> perfect<00:05:32.790> original<00:05:33.300> condition
