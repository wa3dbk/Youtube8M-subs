00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
even notice my eyes moving so I guess I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.039

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
know maybe when I'm calm relaxed they

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
know maybe when I'm calm relaxed they
don't<00:01:19.200> move<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.100> drinking

I<00:01:53.909> noticed<00:01:54.270> some<00:01:56.329> different<00:01:57.329> types<00:01:57.509> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I noticed some different types of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.300 
I noticed some different types of
nystagmus<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.320> different<00:01:58.590> types<00:01:58.710> that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
nystagmus there are different types that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.649 
nystagmus there are different types that
move<00:01:59.490> different<00:01:59.790> ways<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.270> eyes<00:02:00.390> may

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
move different ways like your eyes may

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
move different ways like your eyes may
move<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.170> different<00:02:01.259> motions<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.430> at

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
move in different motions and at

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.959 
move in different motions and at
different<00:02:03.659> speeds<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:05.159> eyes<00:02:05.640> move

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
different speeds and like my eyes move

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.580 
different speeds and like my eyes move
faster<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.630> look<00:02:06.780> one<00:02:06.990> side<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.409> slower

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
faster when I look one side and slower

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.030 
faster when I look one side and slower
when<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.829> look<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> other

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.460 

but<00:02:13.120> yeah<00:02:14.120> everybody's<00:02:14.569> are<00:02:14.810> different<00:02:15.230> some

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
but yeah everybody's are different some

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.050 
but yeah everybody's are different some
people<00:02:15.500> are<00:02:15.890> lucky<00:02:16.069> not<00:02:16.310> enough<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.880> not<00:02:17.030> have

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
people are lucky not enough to not have

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.610 
people are lucky not enough to not have
an<00:02:17.300> assignments<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:18.910> think<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:21.370> don't<00:02:22.370> know

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
an assignments I think that I don't know

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.809 
an assignments I think that I don't know
I've<00:02:24.620> noticed<00:02:24.860> some<00:02:25.130> people's<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.550> are<00:02:25.640> so

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
I've noticed some people's that are so

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.220 
I've noticed some people's that are so
much<00:02:25.970> slower<00:02:26.330> than<00:02:26.510> mine<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:26.959> I've<00:02:27.110> like

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
much slower than mine like I've like

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.199 
much slower than mine like I've like
mine's<00:02:27.470> really<00:02:27.650> fast<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:28.490> sometimes<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.060> not

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
mine's really fast so sometimes it's not

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.720 
mine's really fast so sometimes it's not
as<00:02:29.420> noticeable<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:30.140> person<00:02:30.500> because<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.610> is

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
as noticeable in person because it is

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.520 
as noticeable in person because it is
just<00:02:31.910> like<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> quick<00:02:32.330> jerk<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.260> feel<00:02:33.410> like

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
just like a quick jerk and I feel like

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.650 
just like a quick jerk and I feel like
some<00:02:33.740> people's<00:02:34.010> move<00:02:34.190> really<00:02:34.490> slow<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.330> they

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
some people's move really slow so they

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660 
some people's move really slow so they
kind<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.050> looks<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.680> they're<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.220> painting

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
kind of looks like they're just painting

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.850 
kind of looks like they're just painting
around<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.060> room<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.450> know<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.250> mine's<00:02:40.459> like

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
around the room you know but mine's like

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.140 
around the room you know but mine's like
but<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.130> see<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.550> mirror<00:02:43.730> sometimes

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
but I can see it in the mirror sometimes

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.110 
but I can see it in the mirror sometimes
if<00:02:44.270> I'm<00:02:44.390> looking<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.070> um<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.130> can<00:02:46.520> notice<00:02:47.000> it

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
if I'm looking for it um I can notice it

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.340 
if I'm looking for it um I can notice it
but<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.300> usually<00:02:47.600> don't<00:02:47.720> really<00:02:47.959> notice<00:02:48.110> it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
but I usually don't really notice it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.710 
but I usually don't really notice it
even<00:02:48.440> if<00:02:48.650> I'm<00:02:48.739> looking<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.190> mirror<00:02:49.720> but

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
even if I'm looking in the mirror but

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.810 
even if I'm looking in the mirror but
yeah<00:02:51.200> that's<00:02:51.410> why<00:02:51.590> my<00:02:51.709> eyes<00:02:51.739> bounce<00:02:52.250> because<00:02:52.790> I

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
yeah that's why my eyes bounce because I

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.870 
yeah that's why my eyes bounce because I
have<00:02:53.120> albinism<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.810> sinus<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> part<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.190> most

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
have albinism a sinus is a part of most

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.370 
have albinism a sinus is a part of most
people<00:02:56.209> with<00:02:56.300> albinism<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:56.989> said<00:02:57.170> some

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
people with albinism like I said some

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.449 
people with albinism like I said some
people<00:02:57.500> are<00:02:57.680> lucky<00:02:57.769> enough<00:02:58.040> not<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.400> it

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
people are lucky enough not to have it

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.180 
people are lucky enough not to have it
um<00:02:58.880> I<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:03.110> wish<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.500> knew<00:03:03.650> what<00:03:03.680> caused<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.070> I

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
um I I wish I knew what caused it I

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.080 
um I I wish I knew what caused it I
don't<00:03:04.310> know<00:03:04.400> what<00:03:04.459> caused<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.820> know<00:03:04.940> they're

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
don't know what caused it I know they're

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.060 
don't know what caused it I know they're
surgeries<00:03:05.450> for<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.959> not<00:03:06.050> from<00:03:06.650> what<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:06.980> can

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
surgeries for it and not from what I can

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.020 
surgeries for it and not from what I can
tell<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.660> surgeries<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.560> me<00:03:09.769> don't<00:03:10.730> seem

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
tell it the surgeries to me don't seem

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.640 
tell it the surgeries to me don't seem
to<00:03:11.150> make<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.480> difference<00:03:11.870> because<00:03:12.050> I<00:03:12.170> have<00:03:12.410> seen

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
to make a difference because I have seen

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.069 
to make a difference because I have seen
videos<00:03:12.769> before<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.400> afters<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.630> don't<00:03:14.780> see

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
videos before and afters and I don't see

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.810 
videos before and afters and I don't see
it<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.320> don't<00:03:15.829> see<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.130> difference<00:03:16.489> in<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.700> if

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
it I don't see a difference in it if

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.340 
it I don't see a difference in it if
anything<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.360> looks<00:03:17.510> worse<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.870> me<00:03:17.989> after<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
anything it looks worse to me after the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.410 
anything it looks worse to me after the
surgery<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.040> slows<00:03:19.280> down<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.880> then

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
surgery because it slows down and then

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.520 
surgery because it slows down and then
it<00:03:20.540> just<00:03:20.660> looks<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:20.989> you're<00:03:21.440> really

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
it just looks like you're really

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.759 
it just looks like you're really
creepily<00:03:22.130> painting<00:03:22.670> around<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:23.030> room<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.739> I

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
creepily painting around a room so I

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.990 
creepily painting around a room so I
don't<00:03:25.010> think<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.250> would<00:03:25.370> get<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.519> surgery<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:25.970> it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
don't think I would get a surgery for it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.759 
don't think I would get a surgery for it
but<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:27.140> heard<00:03:27.320> people<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.560> had

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
but I have heard people that had

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.280 
but I have heard people that had
nystagmus<00:03:28.370> surgeries<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.959> helped<00:03:30.200> with

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
nystagmus surgeries and it helped with

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.039 
nystagmus surgeries and it helped with
their<00:03:30.410> vision<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.769> little<00:03:31.010> bit<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:32.000> um<00:03:32.269> that

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
their vision a little bit so um that

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.810 
their vision a little bit so um that
would<00:03:33.200> definitely<00:03:33.320> be<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.650> plus<00:03:33.890> if<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.640> helps

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
would definitely be a plus if it helps

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.560 
would definitely be a plus if it helps
with<00:03:34.910> your<00:03:35.060> vision<00:03:35.290> but<00:03:36.290> um<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:37.209> don't<00:03:38.209> know

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
with your vision but um I don't know

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.910 
with your vision but um I don't know
anyone<00:03:38.989> personally<00:03:39.320> who's<00:03:39.530> had<00:03:39.709> it

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
anyone personally who's had it
