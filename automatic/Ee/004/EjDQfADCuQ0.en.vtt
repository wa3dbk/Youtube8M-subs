assembly the socket where all the bulbs

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
assembly the socket where all the bulbs
eyes<00:01:03.470> now<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> remove<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.740> two

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
eyes now to remove it right here two

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.359 
eyes now to remove it right here two
little<00:01:07.770> tabs<00:01:08.219> and<00:01:08.579> you'll<00:01:08.789> squeeze<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> tabs

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
little tabs and you'll squeeze the tabs

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:21.560 
little tabs and you'll squeeze the tabs
and<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:12.590> assembly<00:01:13.590> will<00:01:13.710> come<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:20.570> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and the assembly will come out and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.389 
and the assembly will come out and
there's<00:01:22.530> enough<00:01:22.799> room<00:01:23.399> with<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:24.509> wires<00:01:25.399> so

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
there's enough room with the wires so

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.050 
there's enough room with the wires so
you<00:01:26.429> can<00:01:27.890> pull<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.039> out<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.429> like<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
you can pull it out just like that and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.169 
you can pull it out just like that and
now<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.149> can<00:01:33.390> check<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.719> bulb<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.999> can

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
now we can check the bulb and I can

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.239 
now we can check the bulb and I can
clearly<00:01:36.539> see<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:40.009> brake<00:01:41.009> light

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
clearly see that this is the brake light

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:47.569 
clearly see that this is the brake light
bulb<00:01:41.490> right<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.249> it's<00:01:44.249> black<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:46.579> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
bulb right here and it's black and the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
bulb right here and it's black and the
filament<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.630> broken<00:01:49.289> even<00:01:50.509> without<00:01:51.509> testing

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
filament is broken even without testing

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.639 
filament is broken even without testing
it<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:54.200> can<00:01:55.200> tell<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:59.460> bulb<00:01:59.819> is<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
it I can tell that this bulb is the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.770 
it I can tell that this bulb is the
problem<00:02:01.649> why<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.429> don't<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.880> brake<00:02:03.270> light<00:02:03.479> so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
problem why we don't have brake light so

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.520 
problem why we don't have brake light so
we're<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.740> replace<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.069> bulb<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.530> see

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
we're going to replace that bulb and see

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.339 
we're going to replace that bulb and see
if<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.039> works

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.220 

all<00:02:11.950> right<00:02:12.069> now<00:02:12.219> to<00:02:12.280> remove<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.879> bulb<00:02:13.230> it's

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
all right now to remove the bulb it's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.559 
all right now to remove the bulb it's
just<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.499> matter<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:15.450> twisting<00:02:16.450> it

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
just a matter of twisting it

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.589 
just a matter of twisting it
counterclockwise<00:02:16.719> and<00:02:17.709> removing<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.599> this

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
counterclockwise and removing it this

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.509 
counterclockwise and removing it this
bulb<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.280> 34<00:02:21.280> 97<00:02:22.239> if<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:23.409> have<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.980> number

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
bulb is a 34 97 if you have that number

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.589 
bulb is a 34 97 if you have that number
you're<00:02:25.420> all<00:02:25.569> set<00:02:26.340> or<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:28.329> can<00:02:28.659> use<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:30.209> 75

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
you're all set or you can use a 75
