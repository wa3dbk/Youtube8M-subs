understand<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.400> control<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.090> recoil<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.720> use

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
understand and control the recoil I use

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.679 
understand and control the recoil I use
the<00:01:19.350> red<00:01:19.500> dot<00:01:19.680> sight<00:01:19.950> um<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.270> allows<00:01:21.659> me

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the red dot sight um and it allows me

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.899 
the red dot sight um and it allows me
gives<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> mindset<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.040> accuracy<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
gives you that mindset that accuracy and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
gives you that mindset that accuracy and
it<00:01:24.330> allows<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> think<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.040> know

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
it allows me to think on a more you know

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.940 
it allows me to think on a more you know
level<00:01:26.520> based<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> could

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
level based like way that I could

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.170 
level based like way that I could
actually<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.700> oh<00:01:29.790> I've<00:01:29.970> got

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually you know think oh I've got

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.700 
actually you know think oh I've got
accuracy<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> need<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> hit<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.530> where<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
accuracy I need to hit right where that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
accuracy I need to hit right where that
dot<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> start<00:01:32.640> burst<00:01:32.850> firing<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> being

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
dot is so I start burst firing and being

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.480 
dot is so I start burst firing and being
more<00:01:33.689> accurate<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:34.979> way<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> train

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
more accurate so that's one way I train

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
more accurate so that's one way I train
myself<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.119> gun<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.590> this

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
follow by that rule might not be the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.819 
follow by that rule might not be the
most<00:02:36.510> entertaining<00:02:36.719> thing<00:02:37.139> in<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.409> world<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
most entertaining thing in the world I

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.589

an easy one hit kill but apparently it

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.300

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
but i find myself being unsuccessful

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.460 
but i find myself being unsuccessful
with<00:04:45.540> it<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.780> one<00:04:45.870> more<00:04:46.080> thing<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.380> i'm

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
with it and one more thing that i'm

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.680 
with it and one more thing that i'm
trying<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.800> do<00:04:46.950> as<00:04:47.490> i'm<00:04:47.670> rocking<00:04:48.000> scavenger<00:04:48.570> on

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690

trying to do as i'm rocking scavenger on
this<00:04:48.870> i<00:04:49.020> think<00:04:49.440> if<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.770> put<00:04:49.950> scavenger<00:04:50.580> on

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
this i think if you put scavenger on

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.980 
this i think if you put scavenger on
modern<00:04:50.940> warfare<00:04:51.090> 2<00:04:51.330> at<00:04:51.450> least<00:04:51.630> if<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.810> put

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
modern warfare 2 at least if you put

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.200 
modern warfare 2 at least if you put
scavenger<00:04:52.470> on<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.680> mp5k<00:04:53.100> you're<00:04:53.730> ruining<00:04:54.180> the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.260 
scavenger on the mp5k you're ruining the
guns<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:55.470> know<00:04:55.590> potential<00:04:56.270> entirely

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
guns you know potential entirely

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.670
