00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 Hi people welcome my video 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.230
 Today I show you my five masthead 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.060
 beauty products in no one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
 handbag may be missing that she is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.779
 my current handbag from michael 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.609
 kors a beautiful spring 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.590
 Handbag as I think this video 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 is created in cooperation with sabrina vom 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.920
 channel sabrina schiri if she still 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
 should not know the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.800
 unconditional stop by on your canal 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 then this is really a sweet sweet 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.660
 Mouse she becomes the five lifestyle 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.829
 do not introduce products in any 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 handbag may be missing 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.070
 from which you should follow 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.660
 of course, also on your video 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.309
 already all information values 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.809
 I find that in the infobox 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.730
 honestly, what are you looking forward to? 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.140
 she will show in her video and let 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.920
 I like to be inspired 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.390
 but let's start with my five 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.030
 must-have beauty products in the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.530
 handbag let's go with me in the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.180
 handbag may by no means 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.860
 dry shampoo missing 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.420
 I like that of butt very much 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.500
 like to travel in this travel size 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.020
 Of course, perfect for that, too 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.570
 Handbag is in the fragrance direction 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.369
 Coconut exotic so a tropical spray 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 Personally, I am totally on the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.119
 Coconut scent I use 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.590
 Dry shampoo will not handle it 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.880
 somehow my greasy hair too 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.740
 hide or so as a rule 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.479
 Do not you see me with greasy hair 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.430
 running around outside because I see them 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 Just wash it before I find it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 just super good because it just like that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.750
 gives a bit of freshness 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.369
 I just feel better when I am 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.200
 felt that I was good because 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.270
 I am such a fragrance man and it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 actually great about the product is that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 lends volume and if I am now 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.650
 am traveling with me and for example with 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.479
 meet a friend on the coffee 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.070
 spontaneously a bit my hair 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.020
 Refresh with a good scent like this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.360
 a bit of volume and that's it 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.829
 just perfect and that's why I think 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 May it in a handbag on even 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.009
 no case missing if you have one 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.869
 have misc skin or have an oily skin 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.850
 then she will exactly why I say 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.810
 You must not miss you control paper 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.460
 to a handbag 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.950
 the goal just always a bit 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 year not so neat if 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.119
 you shine all over my face I'm fine 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.009
 yes, unfortunately, but that's why 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.049
 I always have the things always 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.700
 Handbag so that when I am very strong 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.950
 just start to shine this to me 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.790
 put the paper on the oily in the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.590
 dab face 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.269
 the make up is not damaged 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.709
 so to speak and you just see again 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.689
 a bit more well-kept because of this 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.670
 whole shine removed from your face 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.230
 and that's why I have these things 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.700
 always a handbag so if you 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.620
 should be able to see me somewhere 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.890
 you like me very much for a control 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.930
 Paper questions in no case may 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.849
 Lip care missing in my handbag 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.870
 and I think that's an absolute must 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.909
 have for handbags 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.409
 I personally think the merchant skin 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.140
 and children's climate is simply the best 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.209
 because she is very very cheap super good 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 Maintains the lips and also this tube 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.450
 Of course, it is practical for traveling 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.620
 because he does not like me that way personally 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.060
 like to be there with somehow 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.290
 finger purely must paw and in which 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.150
 small cans or something 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.829
 I just think that something in each 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.239
 Handbag belongs and if it is with you 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.989
 not already, then you should do it 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.290
 change now 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.440
 Another step is definitely 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 a penalty saw in the case I have so 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.190
 a cow brasch that's such a small one 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.500
 handy size, of course, perfect again 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.909
 For the handbag we are very happy if it 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.129
 getting on would be from the principle 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.389
 that wind energy I could see on it 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.040
 do not give up I think it's easy 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.629
 It is very important that you are on the way 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.400
 sometimes a bit tame 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.709
 if i can do with nova for example 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.260
 Gassi was with my dog ​​or something then 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.639
 quite often my hair back out at night 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.650
 and I always think so 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.060
 a little bit the year and you have to 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.109
 not always take off sex but 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.060
 if you look like that a bit 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.310
 want to brush up then belongs to everyone 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.139
 case for me to me once through 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.639
 combing my hair of course if I did 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.739
 wearing a haircut then that is 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.299
 of course less complicated but if I 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 the hair is open then it is me 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.449
 very important that I just go 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.910
 neatly comb through the hair 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.419
 and therefore that such a brush a 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.919
 penalty, his wardrobe or something 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.560
 Something of it must be in any case 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.299
 his handbag is mine 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.190
 really a fifth fell hard 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.810
 select product but not from the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.220
 because I did not know which one 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.049
 because I do not take one but 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.879
 when I have so many and now I am 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.400
 It was a bit difficult 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.379
 to commit myself to 1 but for me 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.269
 personally it is important in any case 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.040
 a lip product so one 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.000
 Lipstick lip gloss or in the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.709
 to have a handbag 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.060
 and then, of course, a color 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.130
 uncomplicated is the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.540
 always goes because of course not 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.950
 always ten corners pen in the handbag 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.350
 I personally had it 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.639
 Usually there but usually it is 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.290
 Of course good if you kinda 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.480
 It has two things and it is easy 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.450
 Fits everything and I would say that 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.940
 i love mcqueen cup that too easy 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.950
 Everything fits where you are in every situation 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.380
 can carry on and just fresh 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.120
 looks well groomed and looks natural 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.180
 also as long as possible on the lips 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.680
 what are your must-have products 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.450
 in the field of beauty in her handbag 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.410
 let me know it will really hurt me 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.510
 interest 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.919
 Everyone has different priorities, of course 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.270
 with me it is somehow so lips and 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.280
 He already noticed that I was there 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.410
 had two products and for the same 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.490
 hair also has two products but it can 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.380
 of course, that you too 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.550
 example nail polish while you have it 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.990
 not cool if the you 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.460
 nail polish plays or something 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.750
 I personally never have me 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.630
 I've never had a nail polish before 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.250
 in the purse to re-apply it 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.930
 so it will really interest me 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.330
 and if she still has inspirations 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.190
 is looking for lifestyle products for 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.870
 The handbag necessarily looks at the 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.180
 sabrina drives you around in everything 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.740
 I like to link to infobox 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.880
 your feedback and hopefully until the 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.880
 next video until then
