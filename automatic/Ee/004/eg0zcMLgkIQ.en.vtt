magic<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.560> know<00:03:44.709> i<00:03:44.739> just<00:03:45.370> i<00:03:45.549> think<00:03:45.610> that

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
magic you know i just i think that

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.420 
magic you know i just i think that
Superman's<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.630> too<00:03:46.930> much<00:03:47.170> for<00:03:48.070> someone

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
Superman's just too much for someone

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.650 
Superman's just too much for someone
like<00:03:48.519> Grenadier<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.970> think<00:03:49.239> if<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.420> was<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
like Grenadier I think if it was the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.660 
like Grenadier I think if it was the
core<00:03:50.110> yeah<00:03:50.769> like<00:03:51.040> if<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.310> was<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.489> Green

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
core yeah like if it was the Green

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.340 
core yeah like if it was the Green
Lantern<00:03:51.760> Corps<00:03:51.940> against<00:03:52.480> Superman<00:03:52.750> now<00:03:53.140> they

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350
