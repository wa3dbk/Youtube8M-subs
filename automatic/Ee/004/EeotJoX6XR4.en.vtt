00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
like patroller a certain area you will

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.150 
like patroller a certain area you will
do<00:00:51.780> well<00:00:51.960> right<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> very<00:00:52.620> powerful

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that door I found it to work well if you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
that door I found it to work well if you
angle<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> Claymore<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> come
