00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
July etc we'll see this seems to be a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.910 
July etc we'll see this seems to be a
good<00:01:14.100> quality<00:01:14.520> leather<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:16.740> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
good quality leather in here that is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.630 
good quality leather in here that is
stamped<00:01:17.430> somehow<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:19.740> doesn't<00:01:19.979> seem<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
stamped somehow it doesn't seem to be a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.719 
stamped somehow it doesn't seem to be a
plastic<00:01:21.770> although<00:01:22.770> who<00:01:22.920> knows<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.430> could<00:01:23.460> be

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
plastic although who knows it could be

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
plastic although who knows it could be
something<00:01:24.060> along<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> vac<00:01:24.750> tech<00:01:25.020> line<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
something along the vac tech line that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.969 
something along the vac tech line that
will<00:01:26.310> find<00:01:26.579> out<00:01:26.759> later<00:01:26.789> on<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:28.289> not<00:01:28.799> quite

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
will find out later on so I'm not quite

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.050 
will find out later on so I'm not quite
sure<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.619> probably<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.909> plastic<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
sure what it is probably is a plastic of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.520 
sure what it is probably is a plastic of
some<00:01:33.299> kind<00:01:33.569> that's<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.049> only<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.350> really

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
some kind that's the only way to really

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.179 
some kind that's the only way to really
stamp<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.249> my<00:01:35.399> opinion<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.090> we'll<00:01:36.420> see

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189
