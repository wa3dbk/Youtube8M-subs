the little piece that you heard the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.740 
the little piece that you heard the
beginning<00:00:57.309> was<00:00:57.609> just<00:00:57.640> sort<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.119> first<00:00:58.390> few

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
beginning was just sort of the first few

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.009 
beginning was just sort of the first few
phrases<00:00:59.049> of<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.559> first<00:00:59.829> solo<00:01:00.659> but<00:01:01.659> the<00:01:01.809> lick

phrases of the first solo but the lick

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.200 
phrases of the first solo but the lick
is<00:01:02.049> even<00:01:02.469> less<00:01:03.010> than<00:01:03.219> that<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:03.609> wanted<00:01:04.089> to

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
is even less than that I just wanted to

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.859 
is even less than that I just wanted to
look<00:01:04.420> at<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.689> particular<00:01:05.670> repetitive<00:01:06.670> six<00:01:07.600> note

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
look at a particular repetitive six note

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.730 
look at a particular repetitive six note
phrase<00:01:08.259> that<00:01:08.560> he<00:01:08.649> plays<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.399> and<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:11.560> is

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
phrase that he plays in this and this is

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.800 
phrase that he plays in this and this is
just<00:01:11.890> sort<00:01:12.069> of<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.280> first<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.300> hopefully<00:01:13.509> a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
just sort of the first of hopefully a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.950 
just sort of the first of hopefully a
little<00:01:14.049> series<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.580> these<00:01:16.270> little<00:01:16.659> tiny

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
little series of of these little tiny

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.919 
little series of of these little tiny
elements<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.920> are<00:01:18.850> present<00:01:19.240> in<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.750> van

Halen<00:01:20.259> style<00:01:20.560> that<00:01:20.890> I'd<00:01:21.069> like<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.280> take<00:01:21.520> a

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
Halen style that I'd like to take a

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.370 
Halen style that I'd like to take a
closer<00:01:21.819> look<00:01:21.970> at<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.630> hopefully<00:01:23.020> if<00:01:23.080> we<00:01:23.170> break

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
closer look at and hopefully if we break

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.699 
closer look at and hopefully if we break
them<00:01:23.560> down<00:01:23.709> enough<00:01:24.299> you'll<00:01:25.299> be<00:01:25.479> able<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.780> apply

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
them down enough you'll be able to apply

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.800 
them down enough you'll be able to apply
them<00:01:26.950> learn<00:01:27.399> them<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.729> then<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.240> manipulate

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
them learn them and then then manipulate

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.330 
them learn them and then then manipulate
them<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.020> apply<00:01:29.259> them<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.590> your<00:01:29.649> own<00:01:29.890> playing

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
them and apply them in your own playing

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.090 
them and apply them in your own playing
so<00:01:30.789> so<00:01:31.569> anyway<00:01:31.690> let's<00:01:32.140> let's<00:01:32.590> get<00:01:32.709> started

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
so so anyway let's let's get started

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.600 
so so anyway let's let's get started
with<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.640> just<00:01:33.909> take<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.360> note<00:01:34.990> by<00:01:35.170> note

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
with it and just take it note by note

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.430 
with it and just take it note by note
alright<00:01:36.610> let's<00:01:36.789> break<00:01:36.970> down<00:01:37.209> this<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:38.110> first

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
alright let's break down this this first

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.039 
alright let's break down this this first
phrase<00:01:38.799> into<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.789> few<00:01:40.119> little<00:01:40.329> segments<00:01:40.869> it's

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
phrase into a few little segments it's

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.870 
phrase into a few little segments it's
it's<00:01:41.380> sort<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.770> second<00:01:42.219> segment<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.820> I

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
it's sort of the second segment that I

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.639 
it's sort of the second segment that I
really<00:01:43.210> want<00:01:43.420> us<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.539> focus<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.170> here<00:01:44.380> because

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
really want us to focus on here because

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.490 
really want us to focus on here because
that's<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.880> lick<00:01:46.149> that<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.509> think<00:01:47.079> is<00:01:47.229> kind<00:01:47.380> of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
that's the lick that I think is kind of

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.380 
that's the lick that I think is kind of
cool<00:01:47.560> in<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.340> could<00:01:48.490> be<00:01:48.670> manipulated

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
cool in this that could be manipulated

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.880 
cool in this that could be manipulated
into<00:01:49.689> a<00:01:49.719> lot<00:01:49.930> of<00:01:49.960> other<00:01:50.170> things<00:01:50.500> if<00:01:50.740> you're

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
into a lot of other things if you're

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.039 
into a lot of other things if you're
willing<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.250> explore<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.789> so<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.840> first

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
willing to explore it so the first

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.169 
willing to explore it so the first
segment<00:01:53.320> though<00:01:53.649> is<00:01:53.829> just<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.250> hammer<00:01:54.520> on<00:01:54.640> a

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
segment though is just a hammer on a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.499 
segment though is just a hammer on a
series<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.020> two<00:01:56.549> strings<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:57.909> we're<00:01:58.359> going<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
series of two strings so we're going to

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.410 
series of two strings so we're going to
have<00:01:58.689> d<00:01:59.380> sharp<00:01:59.409> e<00:01:59.920> F<00:02:00.130> sharp<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:00.700> six<00:02:01.000> seven<00:02:01.329> and

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
have d sharp e F sharp so six seven and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.959 
have d sharp e F sharp so six seven and
nine<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.899> fifth<00:02:02.229> string<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.939> then<00:02:03.939> the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
nine on the fifth string and then the

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
nine on the fifth string and then the
next<00:02:04.329> string<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.630> going<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.049> be<00:02:05.200> G<00:02:05.859> sharp<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.429> B

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
next string is going to be G sharp a B

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.199 
next string is going to be G sharp a B
so<00:02:08.649> pick<00:02:08.979> once<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.429> Hammer<00:02:09.579> the<00:02:09.729> next<00:02:09.970> two<00:02:10.060> on

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
so pick once and Hammer the next two on

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.050 
so pick once and Hammer the next two on
each<00:02:10.329> string<00:02:11.519> triplets<00:02:12.519> that<00:02:12.609> works<00:02:12.850> out

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
each string triplets that works out

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.349 
each string triplets that works out
great

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.359 
great

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.039 
great
so<00:02:13.900> then<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:15.310> phrase<00:02:15.609> that<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.540> was<00:02:16.810> interested

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
so then the phrase that I was interested

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.559 
so then the phrase that I was interested
in<00:02:17.430> focusing<00:02:18.430> on<00:02:18.579> here<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.239> repetitive

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
in focusing on here is the repetitive

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.300 
in focusing on here is the repetitive
lick<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.079> comes<00:02:20.260> after<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.220> going

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
lick that comes after that so it's going

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.740 
lick that comes after that so it's going
to<00:02:21.370> be<00:02:21.579> that<00:02:22.540> lick<00:02:22.780> starts<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.500> C<00:02:23.890> sharp<00:02:24.750> I'm

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
to be that lick starts at C sharp I'm

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.920 
to be that lick starts at C sharp I'm
rolling<00:02:26.109> to<00:02:26.230> D<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> third<00:02:26.890> string<00:02:27.190> and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
rolling to D on the third string and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590 
rolling to D on the third string and
then<00:02:28.930> goes<00:02:29.500> back<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.160> fourth<00:02:30.430> string<00:02:30.790> for

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
then goes back to the fourth string for

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.910 
then goes back to the fourth string for
the<00:02:31.690> B<00:02:31.900> note<00:02:32.139> and<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:33.040> knows

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the B note and that knows

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.089 
the B note and that knows
probably<00:02:35.610> with<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:36.560> with<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.620> downstroke

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
probably with a down with the downstroke

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.210 
probably with a down with the downstroke
would<00:02:38.250> be<00:02:38.340> good<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:40.739> we're<00:02:40.830> gonna<00:02:40.950> pick

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
would be good and then we're gonna pick

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.910 
would be good and then we're gonna pick
the<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.430> next<00:02:42.180> three<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.230> third<00:02:43.530> string

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the the next three on the third string

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.640 
the the next three on the third string
which<00:02:44.910> will<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.239> C<00:02:45.720> sharp<00:02:45.959> D<00:02:46.140> d<00:02:47.870> up<00:02:48.870> down<00:02:49.080> up<00:02:49.319> so

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
which will be C sharp D d up down up so

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.199 
which will be C sharp D d up down up so
the<00:02:49.920> lick<00:02:50.130> that's<00:02:50.459> kind<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.849> whole<00:02:51.000> lick

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the lick that's kind of the whole lick

00:02:51.209 --> 00:03:02.080 
the lick that's kind of the whole lick
the<00:02:51.420> six<00:02:51.660> notes<00:02:51.959> there<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.620> have

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.699 

okay<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.420> little<00:03:03.690> phrase<00:03:03.930> he<00:03:04.200> repeats<00:03:04.530> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
okay so that little phrase he repeats it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.759 
okay so that little phrase he repeats it
a<00:03:05.280> few<00:03:06.180> times<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.599> then<00:03:06.720> he<00:03:06.780> comes<00:03:07.050> down<00:03:07.349> like

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
a few times and then he comes down like

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.710 
a few times and then he comes down like
the<00:03:08.190> fourth<00:03:08.489> time<00:03:08.760> he<00:03:08.940> does<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.269> hammer<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
the fourth time he does the hammer on it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.040 
the fourth time he does the hammer on it
hooks<00:03:10.260> into<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:11.160> new<00:03:12.030> little<00:03:12.300> sequence<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
hooks into a new little sequence of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.130 
hooks into a new little sequence of
thirds<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.709> descends<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.870> same

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
thirds that descends on that same

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.559 
thirds that descends on that same
pattern<00:03:16.440> so

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.380 

okay<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.620> that's<00:03:21.950> gonna<00:03:22.069> be<00:03:22.480> C<00:03:23.480> sharp<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.930> D<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
okay so that's gonna be C sharp to D the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.000 
okay so that's gonna be C sharp to D the
be<00:03:26.569> just<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.049> we're<00:03:27.230> about<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.680> start<00:03:27.920> the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
be just like we're about to start the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.990 
be just like we're about to start the
lick<00:03:28.280> over<00:03:28.670> but<00:03:29.150> then<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.510> connects<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
lick over but then that connects to the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.470 
lick over but then that connects to the
goes<00:03:32.239> back<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.569> third<00:03:32.750> string<00:03:33.109> B<00:03:33.469> and<00:03:34.480> then

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
goes back to the third string B and then

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.750 
goes back to the third string B and then
to<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:36.079> oh<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:38.060> fourth<00:03:38.629> string<00:03:39.340> B<00:03:40.340> on<00:03:40.640> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
to a oh the fourth string B on the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.880 
to a oh the fourth string B on the
fourth<00:03:41.000> string<00:03:41.329> so<00:03:41.659> that's<00:03:41.810> 7<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.739> 9

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
fourth string so that's 7 and 9

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.009 
fourth string so that's 7 and 9
respectively<00:03:43.159> then<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.230> sixth<00:03:45.590> fret<00:03:47.019> then

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
respectively then to the sixth fret then

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.440 
respectively then to the sixth fret then
to<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.319> again<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.980> seventh<00:03:51.980> fret<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:52.879> then

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
to the a again the seventh fret and then

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.610 
to the a again the seventh fret and then
to<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:55.269> sharp<00:03:56.269> on<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.750> fifth<00:03:56.989> string<00:03:57.079> 9th

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
to the a sharp on the fifth string 9th

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.940 
to the a sharp on the fifth string 9th
fret<00:03:59.049> on<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.169> 4th<00:04:00.439> string<00:04:02.650> ends<00:04:03.650> with<00:04:03.799> this

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
fret on the 4th string ends with this

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.920 
fret on the 4th string ends with this
key<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.310> gets<00:04:04.819> bent<00:04:05.090> up<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.329> whole<00:04:05.450> step<00:04:05.689> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
key that gets bent up a whole step and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.050 
key that gets bent up a whole step and
back<00:04:06.049> down<00:04:07.450> ok<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.859> rest<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.430> was

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
back down ok so the rest of it was

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.720 
back down ok so the rest of it was
really<00:04:11.450> just<00:04:11.989> kind<00:04:12.109> of<00:04:12.590> continuing<00:04:13.189> the<00:04:13.459> the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
really just kind of continuing the the

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.280 
really just kind of continuing the the
phrase<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.359> really<00:04:14.720> just<00:04:14.750> wanted<00:04:15.139> us<00:04:15.230> to

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
phrase so I really just wanted us to

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.979 
phrase so I really just wanted us to
learn<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.769> one<00:04:16.009> little<00:04:16.280> lick<00:04:16.430> today<00:04:16.930> ok<00:04:17.930> so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
learn that one little lick today ok so

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.810 
learn that one little lick today ok so
the<00:04:18.229> first<00:04:18.380> thing<00:04:18.680> we<00:04:18.799> want<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:19.039> do<00:04:19.220> after<00:04:19.549> we

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
the first thing we want to do after we

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.430 
the first thing we want to do after we
learn<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.060> lick<00:04:20.329> like<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.079> build<00:04:21.259> it<00:04:21.380> up

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
learn a lick like this and build it up

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.830 
learn a lick like this and build it up
to<00:04:21.500> speed<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.490> start<00:04:23.120> finding<00:04:23.570> out<00:04:23.660> what

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
to speed is to start finding out what

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.740 
to speed is to start finding out what
happens<00:04:24.169> when<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:24.440> change<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.690> structure<00:04:26.690> of

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
happens when we change the structure of

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.890 
happens when we change the structure of
it<00:04:27.050> as<00:04:27.740> far<00:04:27.949> as<00:04:28.039> the<00:04:28.159> intervals<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.389> lick

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
it as far as the intervals so the lick

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.870 
it as far as the intervals so the lick
is<00:04:30.880> natively<00:04:31.880> in<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.780> particular<00:04:33.080> solo<00:04:33.500> it's

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
is natively in this particular solo it's

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.399 
is natively in this particular solo it's
one<00:04:34.880> two<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.330> four<00:04:35.539> as<00:04:35.720> far<00:04:35.900> as<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.080> fingers

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
one two and four as far as the fingers

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.409 
one two and four as far as the fingers
go<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.400> that's<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.639> half<00:04:37.820> step<00:04:37.849> and<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.240> whole

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
go and so that's a half step and a whole

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.560 
go and so that's a half step and a whole
step<00:04:38.659> on<00:04:38.900> each<00:04:39.080> string<00:04:39.760> so<00:04:40.760> then<00:04:41.000> if<00:04:41.150> we<00:04:41.300> wanted

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
step on each string so then if we wanted

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.950 
step on each string so then if we wanted
to<00:04:41.630> take<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:43.389> turn<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.449> into<00:04:44.659> something

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
to take that and turn it into something

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.409 
to take that and turn it into something
new<00:04:45.320> we<00:04:45.590> can<00:04:45.620> simply<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.520> change<00:04:46.849> that

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
new we can simply just change that

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.969 
new we can simply just change that
structure<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:49.310> intervals<00:04:49.820> so<00:04:50.419> let's<00:04:50.659> just

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
structure of of intervals so let's just

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.860 
structure of of intervals so let's just
maybe<00:04:51.979> move<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.610> if<00:04:52.789> we<00:04:53.060> move<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.419> back<00:04:53.449> we're

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
maybe move it if we move it back we're

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.240 
maybe move it if we move it back we're
in<00:04:54.050> D<00:04:54.289> and<00:04:54.620> we<00:04:55.159> were<00:04:55.310> here<00:04:56.919> move<00:04:57.919> it<00:04:58.010> back<00:04:58.220> to

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
in D and we were here move it back to

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.420 
in D and we were here move it back to
the<00:04:58.460> next<00:04:58.699> place<00:04:58.940> back<00:04:59.210> in<00:04:59.419> the<00:04:59.449> scale

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.010 

so<00:05:06.430> then<00:05:06.610> we've<00:05:06.760> got<00:05:06.910> that<00:05:07.120> hole<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.480> half<00:05:07.660> step

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
so then we've got that hole in half step

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.920 
so then we've got that hole in half step
on<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.910> third<00:05:09.910> string<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.390> that<00:05:10.540> just<00:05:10.750> gives

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
on the third string and that just gives

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.480 
on the third string and that just gives
us<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.170> different<00:05:11.500> sound<00:05:11.650> in<00:05:11.830> this<00:05:11.950> case<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
us a different sound in this case the

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.910 
us a different sound in this case the
the<00:05:13.210> root<00:05:13.450> if<00:05:13.660> we're<00:05:13.840> thinking<00:05:14.170> of<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.410> cube<00:05:14.650> B

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
the root if we're thinking of the cube B

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.580 
the root if we're thinking of the cube B
was<00:05:15.580> actually<00:05:16.060> on<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.360> it's<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.170> first<00:05:17.380> note

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
was actually on the it's the first note

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.420 
was actually on the it's the first note
on<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:17.800> third<00:05:17.980> string<00:05:18.340> okay<00:05:19.150> so<00:05:19.950> so<00:05:20.950> anyway<00:05:21.250> we

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
on the third string okay so so anyway we

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.650 
on the third string okay so so anyway we
could<00:05:21.580> move<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.940> to<00:05:22.120> all<00:05:22.240> kinds<00:05:22.600> of

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
could move that to all kinds of

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.660 
could move that to all kinds of
different<00:05:22.960> places<00:05:23.080> we<00:05:23.590> could<00:05:23.740> move<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.460> up<00:05:24.640> to

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
different places we could move it up to

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.090 
different places we could move it up to
a<00:05:24.880> higher<00:05:25.150> position<00:05:25.450> on<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:25.960> scale<00:05:26.230> so<00:05:26.830> now

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
a higher position on a scale so now

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.550 
a higher position on a scale so now
we've<00:05:27.280> got<00:05:30.060> on<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.240> one<00:05:31.420> if<00:05:31.630> we<00:05:32.080> move<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.410> up<00:05:32.530> to

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
we've got on the one if we move it up to

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.230 
we've got on the one if we move it up to
the<00:05:32.710> next<00:05:32.890> place<00:05:33.100> on<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.310> scale<00:05:33.550> we'll<00:05:33.820> end<00:05:34.090> up

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
the next place on the scale we'll end up

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:47.150 
the next place on the scale we'll end up
with<00:05:34.300> two<00:05:34.840> whole<00:05:35.320> steps<00:05:35.500> on<00:05:35.890> the<00:05:36.040> third<00:05:36.220> string

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.100 

okay<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:48.220> if<00:05:48.700> we<00:05:48.910> if<00:05:49.450> we<00:05:49.510> move<00:05:49.870> it<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.080> different

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
okay so if we if we move it to different

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.960 
okay so if we if we move it to different
places<00:05:50.560> in<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.800> scale<00:05:51.160> we<00:05:51.430> just<00:05:51.640> end<00:05:51.820> up<00:05:51.910> with

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
places in the scale we just end up with

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.130 
places in the scale we just end up with
different<00:05:52.710> different<00:05:54.390> finger<00:05:55.390> combinations

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
different different finger combinations

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.240 
different different finger combinations
and<00:05:56.380> different<00:05:56.860> sets<00:05:57.700> of<00:05:57.880> intervals<00:05:58.360> so<00:05:59.250> the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
and different sets of intervals so the

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.030 
and different sets of intervals so the
original<00:06:00.760> version<00:06:01.150> is<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.390> 1st<00:06:02.020> 2nd<00:06:02.410> 4th<00:06:02.740> for<00:06:03.010> a

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
original version is a 1st 2nd 4th for a

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.310 
original version is a 1st 2nd 4th for a
half<00:06:03.250> step<00:06:03.490> and<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.640> whole<00:06:03.790> step<00:06:04.060> if<00:06:04.840> we<00:06:04.960> go<00:06:05.110> back

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
half step and a whole step if we go back

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.730 
half step and a whole step if we go back
in<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.620> scale<00:06:05.890> and<00:06:06.220> start<00:06:06.760> from<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.300> B<00:06:10.590> we<00:06:11.590> end

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
in the scale and start from the B we end

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.260 
in the scale and start from the B we end
up<00:06:11.920> with<00:06:12.130> a<00:06:12.160> whole<00:06:12.340> step<00:06:12.580> and<00:06:12.700> a<00:06:12.760> half<00:06:12.790> step<00:06:12.970> so

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
up with a whole step and a half step so

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.340 
up with a whole step and a half step so
1st<00:06:13.780> 3rd<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.050> 4

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.960 

if<00:06:19.350> we<00:06:19.530> go<00:06:19.650> up<00:06:19.860> in<00:06:20.009> the<00:06:20.100> scale<00:06:20.340> we<00:06:20.550> would<00:06:20.729> have

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
if we go up in the scale we would have

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.790 
if we go up in the scale we would have
two<00:06:21.810> whole<00:06:22.020> steps<00:06:22.320> on<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:22.620> third-string<00:06:23.780> and

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
two whole steps on the third-string and

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.439 
two whole steps on the third-string and
that<00:06:25.800> gives<00:06:25.979> another<00:06:26.310> yet<00:06:26.639> another<00:06:26.669> sound<00:06:27.240> so

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
that gives another yet another sound so

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.379 
that gives another yet another sound so
you<00:06:27.539> could<00:06:27.690> even<00:06:27.810> sequence<00:06:28.289> it<00:06:32.150> okay<00:06:33.150> so<00:06:33.210> try

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
you could even sequence it okay so try

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.480 
you could even sequence it okay so try
changing<00:06:34.350> the<00:06:34.500> lick<00:06:34.740> around<00:06:35.039> a<00:06:35.220> lot<00:06:35.370> of

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
changing the lick around a lot of

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.100 
changing the lick around a lot of
different<00:06:35.759> ways<00:06:35.910> experiment<00:06:36.600> with<00:06:36.750> moving<00:06:37.050> it

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
different ways experiment with moving it

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.070 
different ways experiment with moving it
through<00:06:37.289> the<00:06:37.410> scale<00:06:37.940> and<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.449> also<00:06:39.750> maybe

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
through the scale and and also maybe

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.170 
through the scale and and also maybe
just<00:06:40.320> check<00:06:40.530> out<00:06:40.710> different<00:06:41.580> ways<00:06:41.850> that<00:06:42.000> van

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
just check out different ways that van

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.999 
just check out different ways that van
halen<00:06:42.509> applies<00:06:42.780> this<00:06:42.990> lick<00:06:43.259> so<00:06:43.440> if<00:06:43.530> you<00:06:43.650> listen

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
halen applies this lick so if you listen

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.340 
halen applies this lick so if you listen
to<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.220> song<00:06:44.580> like<00:06:44.940> Spanish<00:06:45.570> Fly<00:06:45.810> from<00:06:46.169> the

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
to a song like Spanish Fly from the

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.490 
to a song like Spanish Fly from the
second<00:06:47.160> van<00:06:47.310> Halen<00:06:47.669> album<00:06:48.050> there<00:06:49.050> you'll<00:06:49.259> hear

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
second van Halen album there you'll hear

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.200 
second van Halen album there you'll hear
this<00:06:49.620> Littman<00:06:50.099> ipil<00:06:50.340> ate<00:06:50.490> it<00:06:50.639> in<00:06:50.759> two<00:06:50.970> or<00:06:51.060> three

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
this Littman ipil ate it in two or three

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.249 
this Littman ipil ate it in two or three
different<00:06:51.509> ways<00:06:51.630> in<00:06:51.870> the<00:06:51.960> same<00:06:52.199> tune<00:06:53.120> so<00:06:54.259> so

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
different ways in the same tune so so

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:58.159 
different ways in the same tune so so
anyway<00:06:55.440> just<00:06:56.150> explore<00:06:57.150> it<00:06:57.360> I<00:06:57.539> think<00:06:57.810> it'll<00:06:57.990> be

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
anyway just explore it I think it'll be

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.070 
anyway just explore it I think it'll be
a<00:06:58.199> really<00:06:58.410> cool<00:06:58.680> little<00:06:58.740> that<00:06:59.639> you<00:06:59.820> can

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
a really cool little that you can

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.350 
a really cool little that you can
improvise<00:07:01.080> with<00:07:01.620> and<00:07:02.220> it's<00:07:02.849> it's<00:07:03.150> a<00:07:03.240> great

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
improvise with and it's it's a great

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.390 
improvise with and it's it's a great
little<00:07:03.720> sound<00:07:03.960> and<00:07:04.320> fun<00:07:04.860> to<00:07:04.949> play<00:07:05.009> it<00:07:05.280> also

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
little sound and fun to play it also

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.650 
little sound and fun to play it also
helps<00:07:05.729> you<00:07:05.820> to<00:07:05.849> build<00:07:06.060> your<00:07:06.180> technique

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 
helps you to build your technique

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.260 
helps you to build your technique
because<00:07:06.990> of<00:07:07.080> that<00:07:07.229> speed<00:07:07.500> burst<00:07:07.710> thing<00:07:08.270> okay

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
because of that speed burst thing okay

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.150 
because of that speed burst thing okay
so<00:07:09.300> that's<00:07:09.660> our<00:07:09.870> lesson<00:07:10.080> today<00:07:10.289> really<00:07:10.770> short

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
so that's our lesson today really short

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.270 
so that's our lesson today really short
and<00:07:11.870> hopefully<00:07:12.870> to<00:07:13.050> the<00:07:13.110> point<00:07:13.470> and<00:07:13.590> hopefully

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
and hopefully to the point and hopefully

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.140 
and hopefully to the point and hopefully
it<00:07:14.340> gives<00:07:14.400> you<00:07:14.550> something<00:07:14.759> to<00:07:14.880> think<00:07:14.940> about
