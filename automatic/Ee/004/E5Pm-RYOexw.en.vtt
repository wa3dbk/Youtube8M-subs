is<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> ballistic<00:01:01.050> tip<00:01:01.230> yes

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
is the ballistic tip yes

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
is the ballistic tip yes
now<00:01:02.010> why<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.149> ballistic<00:01:03.539> tip<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
now why is then the ballistic tip so

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.880 
now why is then the ballistic tip so
popular<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> UK<00:01:06.350> maybe<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
soon as it touches anything so that even

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
soon as it touches anything so that even
if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> haven't<00:01:18.210> hit<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> neck<00:01:18.630> bone<00:01:18.869> itself

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350

head and neck shots you want a very
frangible<00:01:25.770> bullet<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.369> mean<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> were<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
frangible bullet I mean if that were to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.550 
frangible bullet I mean if that were to
go<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> ribcage<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> red<00:01:29.250> deer<00:01:30.560> it's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
go into the ribcage of a red deer it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.890 
go into the ribcage of a red deer it's
not<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> reach<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> heart<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.060> no

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
not going to reach the heart is it no

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
not going to reach the heart is it no
and<00:01:34.200> where<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> problem<00:01:35.280> comes<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.909> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and where the problem comes is if you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
and where the problem comes is if you
hit<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> shoulder<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.290> may<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.650> even<00:01:37.710> reach

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
hit the shoulder it may not even reach

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100 
hit the shoulder it may not even reach
the<00:01:38.310> lungs<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.450> saying<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> soft

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the lungs so you're saying that the soft

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
the lungs so you're saying that the soft
point<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.409> better<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:41.009> heart<00:01:41.220> shots<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
point is better for heart shots and the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.700 
point is better for heart shots and the
ballistic<00:01:42.840> tip<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> better<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.350> next<00:01:43.560> shots

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
ballistic tip is better for next shots

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
ballistic tip is better for next shots
yes<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:44.909> taking<00:01:45.240> hidden

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
yes you know if you're taking hidden

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
yes you know if you're taking hidden
neck<00:01:45.659> shots<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.229> collecting<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.950> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
neck shots you're collecting you're just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.880 
neck shots you're collecting you're just
hunting<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.490> meat<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.560> ballistic<00:01:49.560> tip<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hunting for meat the ballistic tip is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.440 
hunting for meat the ballistic tip is
the<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.159> choice<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:51.060> you're<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> trophy

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the right choice if you're a trophy

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
the right choice if you're a trophy
hunter<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> actually<00:01:52.320> want<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.920> head

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
hunter and you actually want the head

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and the cape then you want a soft point

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
lungs and this one the ballistic tip if

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.160 
lungs and this one the ballistic tip if
you<00:02:02.729> slip<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.090> behind<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.570> shoulder<00:02:03.930> into<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you slip it behind the shoulder into the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
you slip it behind the shoulder into the
lungs<00:02:04.439> it'll<00:02:05.280> often<00:02:05.430> destroy<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.000> Cape<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
lungs it'll often destroy the Cape it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.190 
lungs it'll often destroy the Cape it
will<00:02:07.069> destroy<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> skin<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.720> not<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
will destroy the skin so it's not a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.920 
will destroy the skin so it's not a
great<00:02:10.500> choice<00:02:10.739> for<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.849> trophy<00:02:12.180> hunter<00:02:12.450> so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
great choice for the trophy hunter so

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.800 
great choice for the trophy hunter so
it's<00:02:14.260> open<00:02:14.650> yes<00:02:14.909> well<00:02:15.909> one<00:02:16.269> we<00:02:16.420> don't<00:02:16.540> have<00:02:16.629> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
it's open yes well one we don't have to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.470 
it's open yes well one we don't have to
do<00:02:16.930> much<00:02:17.049> cutting<00:02:17.409> open<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.939> expansion

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
do much cutting open it the expansion

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
do much cutting open it the expansion
has<00:02:19.599> actually<00:02:19.959> torn<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.950> gel<00:02:21.159> apart<00:02:25.079> and<00:02:26.430> dig

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
has actually torn the gel apart and dig

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.420 
has actually torn the gel apart and dig
that<00:02:27.609> round<00:02:27.969> out<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:29.109> bullet<00:02:29.439> is<00:02:29.680> essentially

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
that round out the bullet is essentially

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.569 
that round out the bullet is essentially
intact<00:02:31.739> quite<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.769> lot<00:02:32.920> smaller<00:02:33.189> than<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.400> used

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
intact quite a lot smaller than it used

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.910 
intact quite a lot smaller than it used
to<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.730> oh<00:02:33.969> yes<00:02:34.359> it's<00:02:34.659> totally<00:02:35.019> expanded<00:02:35.709> but

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
to be oh yes it's totally expanded but

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.039 
to be oh yes it's totally expanded but
the<00:02:36.040> weight<00:02:36.189> loss<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.670> almost<00:02:36.939> nil<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.810> what<00:02:37.959> if

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
the weight loss is almost nil so what if

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.809 
the weight loss is almost nil so what if
you<00:02:38.139> weighed<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.620> against<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.459> original

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
you weighed that against the original

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.910 
you weighed that against the original
original<00:02:40.090> it's<00:02:40.659> pretty<00:02:41.319> much<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.620> hundred

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
original it's pretty much a hundred

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.399 
original it's pretty much a hundred
percent<00:02:42.219> weight<00:02:42.579> retention<00:02:43.049> those<00:02:44.049> who<00:02:44.260> were

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
percent weight retention those who were

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.429 
percent weight retention those who were
to<00:02:44.469> about<00:02:44.829> lid<00:02:45.400> loss<00:02:45.840> no<00:02:46.840> doesn't<00:02:47.349> happen

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
to about lid loss no doesn't happen

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.110 
to about lid loss no doesn't happen
doesn't<00:02:47.859> happen<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:48.459> can<00:02:48.609> see<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.000> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
doesn't happen you can see that the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.849 
doesn't happen you can see that the
jacket<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.659> still<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.019> there<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.560> just

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
jacket is still in there it's just

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.460 
jacket is still in there it's just
everything<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.400> folded<00:02:51.879> back<00:02:52.049> yeah<00:02:53.079> that's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
everything is folded back yeah that's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.679 
everything is folded back yeah that's
absolute<00:02:54.220> perfect<00:02:54.609> performance<00:02:54.909> what<00:02:55.510> we

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
absolute perfect performance what we

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.929 
absolute perfect performance what we
would<00:02:55.870> that's<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:57.010> trademark<00:02:57.220> signature<00:02:57.609> of

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
would that's the trademark signature of

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.270 
would that's the trademark signature of
the<00:02:58.030> Oryx<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.930> one<00:02:59.169> was<00:02:59.590> actually<00:02:59.829> nothing

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the Oryx this one was actually nothing

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.709 
the Oryx this one was actually nothing
really<00:03:01.439> to<00:03:02.439> find<00:03:03.269> out<00:03:04.269> what<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.569> all

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:04.719 
really to find out what is all

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.270 
really to find out what is all
disintegrated<00:03:05.379> it<00:03:05.530> has<00:03:05.709> totally

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
disintegrated it has totally

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.539 
disintegrated it has totally
disintegrated<00:03:08.069> which<00:03:09.069> is<00:03:09.189> what<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.400> want<00:03:10.200> yes

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
disintegrated which is what you want yes

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.149 
disintegrated which is what you want yes
so<00:03:12.549> that<00:03:12.730> does<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:12.939> great<00:03:13.180> deal<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.480> damage<00:03:14.159> but

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
so that does a great deal of damage but

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.069 
so that does a great deal of damage but
quite<00:03:15.700> near<00:03:15.909> the<00:03:15.969> surface<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.419> the<00:03:16.480> animal<00:03:16.810> yes

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
quite near the surface of the animal yes

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.559 
quite near the surface of the animal yes
and<00:03:17.439> you<00:03:17.889> know<00:03:18.010> maximum<00:03:18.370> penetration<00:03:19.090> there

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
and you know maximum penetration there

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.099 
and you know maximum penetration there
is<00:03:19.720> really<00:03:20.560> four<00:03:20.590> inches<00:03:21.190> okay<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.449> for<00:03:22.659> foxes

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
is really four inches okay so for foxes

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.629 
is really four inches okay so for foxes
two<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.650> three<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:23.859> mean<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.129> is<00:03:24.190> perfect<00:03:24.340> you

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
two to three I mean this is perfect you

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.559 
two to three I mean this is perfect you
don't<00:03:24.760> want<00:03:24.879> to<00:03:24.940> go<00:03:25.000> further<00:03:25.269> than<00:03:25.389> four

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
don't want to go further than four

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.270 
don't want to go further than four
ridges<00:03:25.720> well<00:03:26.019> depends<00:03:26.650> whether<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.889> actually

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
ridges well depends whether you actually

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.830 
ridges well depends whether you actually
want<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.819> skin<00:03:28.060> or<00:03:28.180> not<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.599> if<00:03:28.690> you're<00:03:28.810> just

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
want the skin or not and if you're just

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.319 
want the skin or not and if you're just
vermin<00:03:29.470> control<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.189> perfect<00:03:30.639> right<00:03:31.000> and

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
vermin control this is perfect right and

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.140 
vermin control this is perfect right and
as<00:03:31.689> I<00:03:31.810> say<00:03:31.959> if<00:03:32.079> you're<00:03:32.199> shooting<00:03:32.739> row<00:03:33.669> or<00:03:33.909> monk

as I say if you're shooting row or monk
jack<00:03:34.799> for<00:03:35.799> meat<00:03:35.949> yes<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.639> you're<00:03:36.729> taking

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
jack for meat yes and you're taking

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.089 
jack for meat yes and you're taking
hidden<00:03:37.269> Nick<00:03:37.389> shots<00:03:37.659> again<00:03:38.049> you're<00:03:38.919> going<00:03:39.010> to

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
hidden Nick shots again you're going to

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.740 
hidden Nick shots again you're going to
chop<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> Nick<00:03:39.549> off<00:03:39.729> and<00:03:39.939> throw<00:03:40.479> that<00:03:40.629> away

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
chop the Nick off and throw that away

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.689 
chop the Nick off and throw that away
and<00:03:41.049> look<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.739> actual<00:03:42.010> meat<00:03:42.159> is<00:03:42.310> fine

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699

with<00:03:52.989> something<00:03:53.349> a<00:03:53.409> little<00:03:53.620> more<00:03:53.650> significant

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
with something a little more significant

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.619 
with something a little more significant
good

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
good

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.289 
good
the<00:03:56.530> Fox<00:03:56.769> shooting<00:03:57.189> bullets<00:03:57.370> did<00:03:57.759> their<00:03:57.970> stuff

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
the Fox shooting bullets did their stuff

a normal Oryx soft point bullet the

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.559 
a normal Oryx soft point bullet the
plastic<00:04:08.680> tipped<00:04:09.009> bullet<00:04:09.400> blows<00:04:09.759> the<00:04:10.090> gel<00:04:10.449> off

plastic tipped bullet blows the gel off

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.469 
plastic tipped bullet blows the gel off
its<00:04:10.750> bench<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:12.310> does<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.849> soft<00:04:13.120> point

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
its bench and so does the soft point

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.529 
its bench and so does the soft point
bullet<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:14.680> caliber<00:04:15.280> really<00:04:15.729> does<00:04:16.030> pack<00:04:16.479> a

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
punch the ballistic tip had reached its

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.010 
punch the ballistic tip had reached its
own.you<00:04:20.859> gone<00:04:21.099> in<00:04:21.250> eight<00:04:22.060> inches<00:04:22.450> that<00:04:22.779> much

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
own.you gone in eight inches that much

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.159 
own.you gone in eight inches that much

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
it have penetrated a bit further

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.880 
it have penetrated a bit further
yes<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.750> jacket<00:04:29.110> actually<00:04:29.380> only<00:04:29.470> went<00:04:29.740> in

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
yes but the jacket actually only went in

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.620 
yes but the jacket actually only went in
eight<00:04:30.250> inches<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:31.090> see<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.240> can<00:04:31.450> see<00:04:31.510> the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
eight inches I can see I can see the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.920 
eight inches I can see I can see the
bits<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.900> green<00:04:32.260> just<00:04:33.360> strewn<00:04:34.360> along<00:04:34.600> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
bits of the green just strewn along the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.990 
bits of the green just strewn along the
along<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.740> bullet<00:04:36.010> path<00:04:36.220> but<00:04:36.670> it's<00:04:36.820> done<00:04:36.970> a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
along the bullet path but it's done a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.880 
along the bullet path but it's done a
lot<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.300> damage<00:04:37.570> at<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.290> end

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
lot of damage at this end

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.090 
lot of damage at this end
yes<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:39.520> again<00:04:39.730> this<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.240> within<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:41.560> much<00:04:41.920> of

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
yes so again this is within that much of

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.890 
yes so again this is within that much of
the<00:04:42.190> deer<00:04:42.430> which<00:04:42.640> is<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:43.180> know<00:04:43.300> good<00:04:43.660> enough

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
the deer which is you know good enough

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.800 
the deer which is you know good enough
for<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.140> hotshot<00:04:44.350> owner<00:04:44.860> on<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.100> red<00:04:45.490> deer<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:46.600> is

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
for a hotshot owner on a red deer it is

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.870 
for a hotshot owner on a red deer it is
but<00:04:47.260> it's<00:04:47.440> marginal<00:04:48.040> but<00:04:48.340> it's<00:04:48.460> very<00:04:48.520> better

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
but it's marginal but it's very better

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.810 
but it's marginal but it's very better
for<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.120> next<00:04:49.330> shot<00:04:49.510> it<00:04:50.050> is<00:04:50.290> um<00:04:50.500> it's<00:04:51.190> marginal
