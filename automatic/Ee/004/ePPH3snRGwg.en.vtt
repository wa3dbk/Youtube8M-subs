 [musics] 

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.559
 Thank you for visiting the Yes video today and say what to do 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.549
 Weathering It is taking a video before the country about weathering It is this 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.969
 There is a guy who can easily weather this Tamiya Weathering Master . 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.269
 you know 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:20.180
 Have I of white and black and brown these is entered in to this kind of Fu 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:24.650
 Well this easy even I'm a thing called can Weathering this time bear on this tag 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.630
 I would like to do weathering with pastel instead of using 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.430
 It is this to use 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:35.450
 Nobel Curry Pastel It is quite well hit by searching for weathering etc. 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.410
 I bought this pastel at a stationery store in Shinsaibashi , but this price is for you 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.170
 178 yen 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 I think that I would like to do weathering this time 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.289
 And if you open this, it will be amazing how pastels look like this 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 This time it is a shame to use a little, and the one with the color that is perfect for such stains and paintings 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.829
 I chose 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.699
 I think that it is all right also separately from those of other manufacturers 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.440
 Let's actually do weathering and use this pastel with 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.760
 After in the flour by shaving this is a pastel and this and this in this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:11.160
 I think that I will put it in already and put on deflation and go to par 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.690
 It's such a small amount, but it can be scraped. If you paint this with a brush, and the corner is appropriate 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.690
 Attached and attached 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 And argues the yellow Capo dog Yes, we have found a little ne tips 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 I feel like this now I think it is a bit difficult to understand in the video 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.560
 And a pom-pom and so much with a great ne powder than I'll Tsu pom-poms as tips on when to put 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.460
 I do not do it 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.170
 The color gets better if you let it go on 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.820
 It is very thin tail so I'll be pom pom 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.500
 I'm going to fly so I won't suck in. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 Put 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.740
 I don't care 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.799
 So I used this pastel for weathering this time 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 I'm thinking of this Pastel and the later Stirring Master 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.320
 And if you do the practice that you do well properly , it will be a real weathering master 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.550
 I wondered if I could do it 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.360
 Or why not even try soiled with this is also Toka after Jiokore Do as I think 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.680
 Then I tried to bebel with pastel and see you in the video 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.680
 Thank you very much 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.739
