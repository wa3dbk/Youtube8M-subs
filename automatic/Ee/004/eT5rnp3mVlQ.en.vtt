00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:12.540
 high tech 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.360
 high-tech lucky one quickly and cleverly 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 gaining on not always too 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 adapted for this keyboard 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.900
 smartphone text message but who is not lucky 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.180
 experiencing difficulties and nervous but here 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.160
 engineers from the institute of technology 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.869
 located in german hour build 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 suggested a different solution 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.349
 typing a message actually leading 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.780
 by air 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.360
 sensors that are built into the special 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.140
 glove decipher movement and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.910
 sends to the server computer further already 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.260
 appropriate juice helps 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 use dialed this way 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:53.820
 text for emails and messages 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:56.340
 so on it is here immediately 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.699
 several types of sensors sensors 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.070
 movements that measure speed and even 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.680
 those that recognize the slope of the letters 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.080
 these signals are recorded well and then 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.560
 transmitted via bluetooth to any 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.450
 widget including on a laptop like 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.310
 only recognition is finished 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.540
 the next stage begins 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.390
 translate sign language 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.170
 realizing that each of them designated that or 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.140
 another letter 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.710
 software which decrypts such a language 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.520
 almost all existing are provided 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 writing algorithms 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.830
 I am today our decision which is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.500
 principle is easily doable and the most difficult 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.380
 for us was at this stage of work 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.740
 find a way to transcode signals 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.420
 motility hands writing already zaur and all 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.950
 this device has eight thousand words 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.229
 she can recognize not only 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.539
 phrases but also whole phrases paragraph 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.950
 however, the error is still quite high and 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.950
 is 11 percent
