00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.299
 it freezes the outside of bellizzi I hate you 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.860
 winter the season the most 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.679
 beautiful ever 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.879
 no where love blossoms no where 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.250
 everything comes to life 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.619
 no the animals mate in which there 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.460
 he rolls happily on the lawns where no 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.529
 bottle calls the dog where you don't 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.779
 then starting from the assumption that 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.090
 there are no more mid-seasons and if there are 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.590
 are they last three days we can 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.970
 to say with certainty that the year is 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.280
 divides into two seasons 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.990
 summer and winter is obvious 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.090
 both people are divided into two 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.800
 factions to those who like summer and who like it 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.940
 winter but let's analyze this well 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.300
 wonderful season 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.270
 winter is cold ice cold dark sad 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.340
 Cloudy icy rainy cloudy 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.960
 full of virus puddles and pains 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.610
 I miss everything a boxer tries 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.410
 start one morning the day before 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.270
 we walked around quietly in shorts 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.620
 and shirt and the day after already from 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.060
 when we are the blankets 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.860
 it takes a hit because among other things 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.390
 the irrepressible desire of ours 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.950
 parents to open the windows has 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.350
 preceded our awakening thus by 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.720
 let us pay for good under go out from 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.220
 bed we go to the bathroom and the tablet 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.810
 frost 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.610
 so before supporting our beautiful 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.040
 butt that we think about crazy 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.570
 different methods to heat it with fano 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.970
 with the aerator in breath with the torch e 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.580
 finally after 10 15 minutes or so we are 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.140
 ready to do what we need to do 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.030
 after having failed, there is the dressing 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.370
 which is not like the summer one that is enough 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.900
 more bullshit we are ready no underwear 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.990
 double pants pajama pants 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.549
 genes and jeans company 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.229
 let's make a nice heavy suit one 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.880
 paper mill that marks fantozzi one 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 long sleeve t-shirt a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.110
 newspaper is covered the five one 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.360
 sleeveless the jacket the scarf the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.009
 hat the other hat snow gloves 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 monbooks and a duvet just to stay 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.520
 rest assured and we spent so one 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.899
 half an hour just to get dressed 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.899
 we open the door and 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.930
 but the storm the temperature I mark on 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.300
 plutone s'avverte is still enough 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 dark and clumsy as umbra type on mono 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.030
 let's take the bus to go to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.280
 school or work 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.680
 inside the situation is tragic who 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.960
 sarno disce who coughs keys snot 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.730
 those who die frozen to death and take off 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.860
 those who light fires stay active from the nose 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.860
 burning the seats and then there in the corner 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.660
 there is a happy little person happy with the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.160
 smile on face that looks 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.900
 out of the window with glitter in the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.720
 eyes as man has seen the mountain 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.180
 golden and she is glad she couldn't wait 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.760
 how beautiful winter would come 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.459
 winter if you ask him how 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.770
 stracazzo makes you like winter her 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.260
 stiff as a peacock will answer is 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.090
 wonderful colors of rain follies 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.950
 that beats the wind on the windows 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.570
 caress the trees a nice cup of 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.100
 hot chocolate in front of the fireplace 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.900
 lit a nice film under the covers 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.090
 caldera elected is not wonderful you are at 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.130
 day that you came out from home no demons 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.020
 take you to the fireplace below the so-called council 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.090
 if you make chocolate in the street you read 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.280
 motorized you will have gone out sooner or later to 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.260
 die cold no and now full osteoarthritis 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.489
 deforming and now slowly arthrosis 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.290
 deforming when you get a breath 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.200
 waxed on that I miss flamethrower 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.300
 the saves or not then here you tell me and 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.860
 so after throwing the nice one 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.570
 little person outside the window 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.550
 we don't do it all day long 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.470
 other than dreaming of coming home on 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.720
 as soon as possible to stick to the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.700
 heater radiator or book arci 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.959
 directly into the fireplace throughout 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.730
 this we realize we have lost 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.620
 almost entirely the use of girls of 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.110
 having your lips violate cracked nose 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.700
 who gives birth to liters and liters of mucus 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.560
 having used 400 hectares of trees 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.090
 transformed into handkerchiefs 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920
 madonna headache of having one 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.630
 real love relationship with gods 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.959
 medicines with an unpronounceable name 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.610
 and all this repeated for just six 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.470
 months there is nothing to do 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.459
 I hate winter the only healthy remedy 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.050
 that comes to mind is that of 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.849
 emigrate to a country below 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.590
 of the equator but certainly not a thing 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.910
 that can be done every year so if 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.519
 you have useful tips to arrive 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.530
 safe and sound to the next and much loved 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.349
 summer leave me a comment below 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.660
 Going to not tell me about chocolate 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.220
 warm in front of a floating fireplace on 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.380
 a motorized bed while out 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.830
 hail with large grains like 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.830
 cucumbers
