00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
has two teeth so you might be a lot of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.359 
has two teeth so you might be a lot of
fun<00:01:25.829> to<00:01:25.920> talk<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
fun to talk to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
fun to talk to
it<00:01:27.299> reminds<00:01:27.630> me<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.719> talking<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> babies

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it reminds me of talking to the babies

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
it reminds me of talking to the babies
they're<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.070> 6<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> 12<00:01:29.789> months<00:01:30.030> old<00:01:30.180> that's

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
they're about 6 to 12 months old that's

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
they're about 6 to 12 months old that's
when<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:30.899> start<00:01:31.079> teething<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.340> he

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
when they start teething so I think he

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.510 
when they start teething so I think he
says<00:01:32.820> will<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.149> sound<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.630> intelligent

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
says will not sound very intelligent

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520 
says will not sound very intelligent
next<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.609> have<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.969> civilian<00:01:36.350> who<00:01:37.350> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
next we have the civilian who is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
next we have the civilian who is
probably<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> least<00:01:38.159> desired<00:01:38.579> when<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
probably the least desired when you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.060 
probably the least desired when you
figure<00:01:39.359> out<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.719> set<00:01:39.899> here<00:01:40.109> this<00:01:40.859> is<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
figure out of the set here this is the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
figure out of the set here this is the
same<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> tripod

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.990 
too so if you have that it's almost

minifigure that you see here except for

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.129 
minifigure that you see here except for
a<00:02:58.230> lawyer<00:02:58.470> over<00:02:58.620> there<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.150> end<00:03:00.299> yet

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
a lawyer over there and in the end yet

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.470 
a lawyer over there and in the end yet
when<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.439> compare<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:02.209> you're<00:03:03.209> getting<00:03:03.329> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
when you compare it you're getting the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.059 
when you compare it you're getting the
same<00:03:03.629> minifigures<00:03:04.169> but<00:03:04.439> in<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.709> case<00:03:04.889> you're

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
same minifigures but in this case you're

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.629 
same minifigures but in this case you're
getting<00:03:05.189> a<00:03:05.459> defender<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.659> striker<00:03:06.900> and

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
getting a defender and a striker and

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.559 
getting a defender and a striker and
versus<00:03:08.639> that<00:03:08.760> mini<00:03:08.939> figure<00:03:09.180> over<00:03:09.299> there<00:03:09.389> so

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
versus that mini figure over there so

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.909 
versus that mini figure over there so
obviously<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.260> would<00:03:10.409> be<00:03:10.469> the<00:03:10.560> better<00:03:10.709> deal

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
obviously this would be the better deal

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.339 
obviously this would be the better deal
so<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.939> that<00:03:12.090> respect<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.689> not<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> were

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
so in that respect is not really a were

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.229 
so in that respect is not really a were
false<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.799> they<00:03:13.919> get<00:03:14.099> your<00:03:14.819> butt<00:03:14.969> off<00:03:15.030> just

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
false that they get your butt off just

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.280 
false that they get your butt off just
spending<00:03:15.450> your<00:03:15.569> money<00:03:15.659> over<00:03:15.930> here<00:03:15.959> at<00:03:16.169> least

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
spending your money over here at least

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.229 
spending your money over here at least
should<00:03:16.409> get<00:03:16.530> some<00:03:16.680> vehicles<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.370> parts<00:03:17.700> stuff

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
should get some vehicles and parts stuff

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.569 
should get some vehicles and parts stuff
like<00:03:18.389> that<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.979> think<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:20.310> would<00:03:20.459> have

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
like that and I think what would have

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.369 
like that and I think what would have
made<00:03:20.609> this<00:03:20.909> set<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> little<00:03:21.359> bit<00:03:21.449> better<00:03:21.659> is<00:03:21.959> if

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
made this set a little bit better is if

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.170 
made this set a little bit better is if
they<00:03:22.739> replace<00:03:23.099> this<00:03:23.370> guy<00:03:23.459> with<00:03:23.760> an<00:03:23.879> alien

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
they replace this guy with an alien

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.490 
they replace this guy with an alien
clinger<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:25.079> would've<00:03:25.229> been<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.379> lot

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
clinger and that would've been a lot

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.830 
clinger and that would've been a lot
better<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.010> that's<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.449> sums<00:03:27.629> up<00:03:27.690> my

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
better and that's it that sums up my

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.449 
better and that's it that sums up my
review<00:03:27.989> hope<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.769> guys<00:03:28.889> enjoyed<00:03:29.159> this<00:03:29.280> show
