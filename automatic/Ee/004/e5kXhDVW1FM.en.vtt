00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.759
 More than 27,000 people come to me from April 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:13.449
 By Area 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.649
 Let's try the exercise a little Here is the present 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.800
 There may be no and lower body or back. 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.630
 The body of a man 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.029
 The writer's prize 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.239
 Exercise 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.929
 Let's try a bench press using gold. 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.589
 Our editorial department is developing Lee Hyun-gon. 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:38.469
 Among them, sports clinics that can develop the entire hospital 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.589
 But you have to be careful of injuries while exercising. 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.680
 I could have a business opportunity in Busan and then 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.270
 I can not end up elbowing that point 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 I'm jumping with caution. 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.800
 Determined 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.580
 A small, always showing a shoulder before the carson 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.920
 Stretching in the chest 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.189
 There are many ways to stretch a person 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.620
 One of the things I do is 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.340
 Take the hand of 4.25. 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.920
 My singer singer bowed down to the enemy 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.079
 Korea University president is going to stretch because of this day 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.170
 It can be done smoothly 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 Me one 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.290
 Like the opposition 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.290
 Be good 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.110
 And give me the defect. 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.020
 Personality is very important as well. 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.590
 In doing such a movement that only Son Gong can have 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.630
 Once again explained, bathing success 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.840
 The reception room of Suncheon 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.260
 The small number is Jamon in the center 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.119
 Before the homeless sit 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.450
 I will not. 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.550
 In position 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.670
 I'm proud of being small and can I catch it? 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.220
 Less is industry-specific and it's pre-college credit 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.069
 Pair them up in an arched form. 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.709
 One of the mistakes that focused users are making 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.660
 How to fold a picture 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270
 5. 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.809
 It was a South Sea tsunami. 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:22.209
 There were photo-novice people who got three 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.189
 Slow down 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.680
 I am so confident that I am very proud of that. 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.089
 Because he's busy, his injury history is very low. 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.249
 But all the heavier weights have given this opportunity 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.690
 Peep 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.150
 The colonel can be rented out as it is. 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.690
 I put it up. 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.600
 to break 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.929
 That can hold me 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.519
 So hard 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.929
 Slow down 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.490
 0 From Seoul National University 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.490

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
 41 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.379
 Lap 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.379
 Climb 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.789
 Until now, Smith has used stencil 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:22.929
 I was sick. 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.139
 Please be careful when you answer -on during your election campaign. 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.849
 Magnetic voice 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.989
 The fact that you give a concubine to over pictures rather than magnetic news 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.639
 Protecting your courtesy 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.019
 And no 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.349
 And then you saved your elbow as much as possible. 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.359
 Never 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.859
 You're exercising slowly. 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.519
 And the pitcher and the rest of the pitcher is a lot of tension 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.589
 You're curious. 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:47.170
 Typical 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.529
 simone 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.359
 15 days in the editorial and in each field 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.019
 If you indicate about 30 seconds, 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:55.899
 I did 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.090
 If 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.260
 Until the day when the 40 million people become the body 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
 I put pressure on play. 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:19.779
 One.
