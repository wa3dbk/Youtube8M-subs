a killstreak on the map fog this was
taken<00:00:20.460> from<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.060> live<00:00:21.300> stream<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.810> did<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> few

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
taken from a live stream I did as a few

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
taken from a live stream I did as a few
warm-up<00:00:22.920> games<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.789> ended<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.300> being<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
warm-up games and it ended up being a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960 
warm-up games and it ended up being a
really<00:00:24.750> good<00:00:25.109> gameplay<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.980> ended<00:00:26.460> up<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.730> on

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
really good gameplay I ended up going on

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.700 
really good gameplay I ended up going on
i<00:00:27.000> think<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.539> 10<00:00:27.840> kill<00:00:28.140> streak<00:00:28.470> so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
i think it was like a 10 kill streak so

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
i think it was like a 10 kill streak so
it<00:00:28.800> was<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.519> good<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:30.240> third<00:00:30.510> my

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it was really really good my third my

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
it was really really good my third my
first<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.260> using<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.340> went<00:00:32.489> really

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
first time using it and it went really

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.310 
first time using it and it went really
well<00:00:32.880> now<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.329> sorry<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> quality<00:00:34.110> isn't

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
well now I'm sorry if the quality isn't

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.380 
well now I'm sorry if the quality isn't
as<00:00:34.500> good<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.829> normal<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> did

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
as good as normal this is because I did

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
as good as normal this is because I did
take<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> live<00:00:37.260> stream<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> didn't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
take it from the live stream so I didn't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
take it from the live stream so I didn't
have<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.610> didn't<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.090> record<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> same

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
have I didn't like record at the same

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.540 
have I didn't like record at the same
time<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.680> literally<00:00:40.950> from<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> live

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
time so this is literally from the live

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
time so this is literally from the live
stream<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> quality<00:00:42.660> isn't<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.140> good<00:00:43.290> as

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
stream so the quality isn't as good as

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
stream so the quality isn't as good as
normal<00:00:43.710> that's<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> reason<00:00:44.460> why<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.969> let's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
normal that's the reason why so let's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
normal that's the reason why so let's
get<00:00:45.300> started<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.350> kill<00:00:46.620> streak<00:00:46.860> now

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
the health that you have is a lot higher
than<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.939> maniac<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
than the maniac and I think that you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
than the maniac and I think that you
also<00:01:41.130> run<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> lot<00:01:41.759> quicker<00:01:41.970> than<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.360> may<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
also run a lot quicker than they may the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.359 
also run a lot quicker than they may the
maniac<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> base<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> maniac

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
maniac so if you base it on the maniac

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.179 
maniac so if you base it on the maniac
kill<00:01:44.579> streak<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.810> an<00:01:45.960> Opie<00:01:46.530> version<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
kill streak it's like an Opie version of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.780 
kill streak it's like an Opie version of
that<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.700> speed<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.680> just<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> sheer<00:01:50.520> power

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that the speed and just the sheer power

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
that the speed and just the sheer power
of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.750> kill<00:01:51.960> tree<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.409> ridiculous<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.399> like

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
of the kill tree is ridiculous I like

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.999 
of the kill tree is ridiculous I like
the<00:01:54.060> way<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> map<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.899> well<00:01:55.649> designed

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the way that the map is well designed

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.149 
the way that the map is well designed
for<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> scary<00:01:57.299> dark<00:01:58.020> foggy<00:01:58.590> map<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
