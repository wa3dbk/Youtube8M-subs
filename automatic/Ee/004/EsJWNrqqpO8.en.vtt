the origins of Christianity the teaching
attributed<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.290> Jesus<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:49.920> on<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.250> would

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
attributed to Jesus and so on it would

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.470 
attributed to Jesus and so on it would
just<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> historical<00:03:51.440> non-starter<00:03:52.670> on<00:03:53.670> top

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
just be a historical non-starter on top

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.290 
just be a historical non-starter on top
of<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.840> we<00:03:55.080> can<00:03:55.320> trace<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.850> unbroken

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
of that we can trace the unbroken

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.410 
of that we can trace the unbroken
existence<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:59.070> Christian<00:03:59.519> Church<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.239> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
existence of the Christian Church of the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.979 
existence of the Christian Church of the
community<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.260> his<00:04:01.950> followers<00:04:02.550> from<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
community of his followers from the the

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.920 
community of his followers from the the
very<00:04:04.230> first<00:04:04.760> decade<00:04:05.760> after<00:04:06.330> his<00:04:06.570> death

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
very first decade after his death

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.100 
very first decade after his death
probably<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.709> 80<00:04:07.950> 30<00:04:08.370> some<00:04:08.850> would<00:04:09.030> say<00:04:09.180> 33<00:04:09.870> and

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
probably in 80 30 some would say 33 and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.289 
probably in 80 30 some would say 33 and
so<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:12.920> claim<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:13.950> we<00:04:14.280> can't<00:04:14.580> know<00:04:14.790> Jesus

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
so the claim that we can't know Jesus

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.490 
so the claim that we can't know Jesus
existed<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:17.519> simply<00:04:18.000> absurd<00:04:18.390> people<00:04:19.169> who

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
existed is is simply absurd people who

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.820 
existed is is simply absurd people who
who<00:04:20.310> would<00:04:20.459> make<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:21.260> charge<00:04:22.260> are<00:04:22.590> very

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
who would make that charge are very

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.390 
who would make that charge are very
poorly<00:04:23.220> informed<00:04:24.350> what<00:04:25.350> I'd<00:04:25.470> always<00:04:25.710> ask<00:04:25.950> with

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
poorly informed what I'd always ask with

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.170 
poorly informed what I'd always ask with
people<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.820> to

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
people is to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.050 
people is to
be<00:04:27.270> consistent<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:29.070> if<00:04:29.190> they<00:04:29.310> want<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.550> say<00:04:29.820> we

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
be consistent so if they want to say we

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.550 
be consistent so if they want to say we
can't<00:04:30.419> know<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.690> Jesus<00:04:31.169> was<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.380> historical

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
can't know that Jesus was a historical

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.830 
can't know that Jesus was a historical
figure<00:04:32.039> they're<00:04:32.850> also<00:04:33.000> going<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.389> have<00:04:33.539> to<00:04:33.690> say

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
figure they're also going to have to say

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.270 
figure they're also going to have to say
we<00:04:33.990> can't<00:04:34.229> know<00:04:34.410> all<00:04:34.440> sorts<00:04:34.949> of<00:04:35.009> other<00:04:35.160> things

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
we can't know all sorts of other things

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.760 
we can't know all sorts of other things
so<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.150> lot<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.660> time<00:04:36.870> people<00:04:36.900> want<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.590> have

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
so a lot of the time people want to have

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.820 
so a lot of the time people want to have
a<00:04:38.210> harsher<00:04:39.210> rule<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:39.930> evidence<00:04:40.320> when<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.530> comes

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
a harsher rule of evidence when it comes

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.890 
a harsher rule of evidence when it comes
to<00:04:41.039> things<00:04:41.430> about<00:04:41.610> Jesus<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.180> they<00:04:42.300> do<00:04:42.360> about

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
to things about Jesus and they do about

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.310 
to things about Jesus and they do about
other<00:04:43.199> areas<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:45.120> claim<00:04:45.389> that<00:04:45.600> Jesus<00:04:46.050> never

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
other areas the claim that Jesus never

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.790 
other areas the claim that Jesus never
existed<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.340> myth<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.900> fact<00:04:49.169> is<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.500> he

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
existed is a myth the fact is that he
