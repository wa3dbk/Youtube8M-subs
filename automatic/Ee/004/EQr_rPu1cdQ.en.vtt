00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.960
 ford howard 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.960
 presents 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.560
 very good friends we are back here 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.210
 in the garage we are going to talk about the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.210
 audi rs5 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.960
 I think I've told you a couple of times 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:33.520
 that audi are cars that I enjoy 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.910
 much much more from the audi a5 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:42.250
 and this is the most powerful version and 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.980
 equipped with the five is the rs5 not the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.410
 rs as you already know are the audi 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.950
 more powerful 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.110
 the shape the car design follows continues 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.629
 I think very much liking 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.900
 nice about all this coupe two 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.090
 doors is not a solid modern car 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.879
 firm that looks great on the street of 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.380
 done I remember the first few times 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.140
 sorry I saw it in salons no 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.960
 It seemed so nice to me when I saw it 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.790
 in the street in person there, it seems to me 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.300
 a sensational car and in the network it 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.610
 has its explosive details like 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.160
 mirrors here with finished in 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.570
 matte aluminum also the wheels say 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.729
 exclusive 20 inches and two or three 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.140
 details but the main thing really of the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.630
 rs5 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.630
 is inside the car not only here 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.409
 inside also in there not the engine 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.470
 what you are seeing now is a v8 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.950
 4.2 liters with nothing less than 450 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.890
 horses that engine does wonders for 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.050
 the car and it has a delicious sound 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.520
 accelerates super fast we achieve 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.979
 5.1 seconds from 0 to 100 here at 1000 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.090
 around one thousand 600 meters of altitude that 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.220
 has clear Guadalajara is an engine 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.630
 Turbo direct injection and turbo 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.730
 obvious helps him to put very close to his 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.340
 official acceleration no 5.1 seconds is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.790
 truly a very good number and the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.650
 braked in 38 meters of 105 meters less 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.410
 that the period if we are not 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.560
 comparing period 68 with the audi rs5 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.870
 of course since that costs 245 thousand 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.300
 weights and this costs 350 million 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.470
 then it is obvious that we can not 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.230
 compare 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.370
 but 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:42.659
 and you get in the car and you have what I audi 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.909
 we are badly or badly used to 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.360
 magnificent finished a skin of very 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.700
 good level seats with good support 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.269
 support even for knots 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.420
 cupholders a whole range of buttons 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.840
 etc. that helps us make life 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.319
 more interesting the key we can use 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.720
 from here I know how to press the button here 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.610
 of ignition or we can put it in your 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.200
 place quoted there I like that you have 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.209
 its place 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.099
 because sometimes it gets in the way or is brought 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.410
 you stop it did not matter if you lose 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.420
 storage spaces here as 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.700
 you obviously have a screen with gps 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.560
 here with the m / m controls that are 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.300
 those buttons that lets you go 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.130
 controlling exterior conditioning 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.680
 car setting and so on do not brake 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.900
 hand et cetera we can do to 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.849
 achieve 0 to 100 in this good car 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.130
 has the self-control that is the launch 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.560
 control or how the launch is achieved 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.880
 control well first we put the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.430
 lever of the gearbox in the 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.170
 sports mode we put it a little bit more 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.060
 back here on the board let's see now 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.630
 in that one then we go to the control of 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.960
 traction and we press it around 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.580
 of 5 seconds 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.950
 but since I have the door open 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.670
 right now does not let me do this kind of 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.950
 changes when we keep it pressed 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.230
 and about 5 seconds 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.170
 disconnects the traction control and with 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.780
 that we have the launch control is 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.610
 means optimal maximum acceleration 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.480
 that the car can do 0 to 100 already 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.340
 I said 5.1 seconds was what this achieved 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.440
 other 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.540
 here in the circuit is where really 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.250
 have fun with the type of car is a 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.260
 car that can be very good very 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.550
 pleasant for the city for the day to 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.990
 day but when you bring it in a place I've 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.510
 made to have fun with him 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.830
 you also have a great great coach in the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.500
 way that you grip on the curves of 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.990
 sensational and is more than recommended 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.360
 leave the stability control 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.420
 put because it gets you out of trouble 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.670
 now everything is full of puddles and the 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.940
 puddles because they are fun to instead of 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:00.420
 go and see but when it's time to walk 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.520
 with the strong car out there threatens you 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.260
 take out again and again the track and the 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.990
 Stability control works very well 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.240
 and it keeps you on the path is not a 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.820
 extremely pleasant car to me 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.370
 I love, I really like a lot, a lot, this 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.740
 car frankly I do not know if in the 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.260
 equivalent or similar versions of 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.550
 mercedes benz that bm w I would like 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.020
 as much as I like the rs5 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.120
 and this that this car has also passed 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.760
 for the same thing that happened the 208 is 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.060
 say by the hands of our colleagues 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.220
 of the media and you already have two or three 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.290
 things ring this ring for example is in 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.300
 poor condition in some aspects but 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.850
 it's still such a beautiful car 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.430
 nice can be can have comfort 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.860
 for every day you can have 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.380
 Acceleration for road curve or for 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.690
 road can be fun even 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.930
 when he transforms it into a car 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:59.710
 races here here on the race course 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.650
 for that engine is an engine that is not 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.169
 it's not new it's not an engine that was made 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.090
 for this car there are versions of the 8 and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.639
 of the 6 that have already used this engine for 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.560
 some time but in a car smaller than 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:16.990
 at 6 o'clock that the 8 as is the s5 the rs5 at 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.860
 this case its performance is even better 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.870
 you do not have the best of both worlds that 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 you can have for example compare that 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.479
 car with a shelby mustang and you will have a 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.370
 similar acceleration capacity not 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.900
 even the cello is faster 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.570
 the chevy has 200 horsepower 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.220
 more but this car can do the 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.789
 curves with a precision that the shelby 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.470
 he does not even dream of doing it then 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:45.190
 let's say maybe it would be better to compare it 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:48.370
 with a ski camera costs what two 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.560
 cameras but probably do almost what 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.440
 that two cameras on roads is worth what 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.320
 that two cameras in refinement in in 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.000
 end and management and in coexistence 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.920
 widespread with the car I do not love 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.840
 I love it 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.380
 and the only thing that I really am not very 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.390
 sure is if I like this or the car more 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.510
 what are we going to talk about now 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:13.420
 let's come back from the cut we're talking 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.070
 of course porsche cayman so 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.990
 what do you do with us and right now 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.370
 we came back to talk about the porsche 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.370
 cayman 2014
