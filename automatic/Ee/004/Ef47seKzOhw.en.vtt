so<00:02:13.569> if<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.560> point<00:02:14.800> still<00:02:15.010> stands<00:02:15.340> though<00:02:15.640> I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
so if the point still stands though I

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.699 
so if the point still stands though I
mean<00:02:16.000> when<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.750> series<00:02:16.989> first<00:02:17.290> started<00:02:17.620> like

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.979 
Mira is taken over some form of demon in
the<00:03:18.459> past<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.910> be<00:03:19.000> able<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.239> use<00:03:19.359> Satan<00:03:19.750> soul

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
the past to be able to use Satan soul

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.640 
the past to be able to use Satan soul
and<00:03:20.319> yours<00:03:20.799> demon<00:03:21.130> particles<00:03:21.609> and<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.870> mean<00:03:23.319> you

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
and yours demon particles and I mean you

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.050 
and yours demon particles and I mean you
can<00:03:23.829> kind<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.190> guess<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.609> this<00:03:24.760> has<00:03:24.940> been

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
can kind of guess that this has been

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.729 
can kind of guess that this has been
hinted<00:03:25.540> at<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:25.959> didn't<00:03:26.440> come<00:03:26.590> out<00:03:26.620> of

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
hinted at it like didn't come out of

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.830 
hinted at it like didn't come out of
nowhere<00:03:26.859> because<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.579> mean<00:03:27.819> Satan<00:03:28.510> soul<00:03:28.690> has

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
nowhere because I mean Satan soul has

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.090 
nowhere because I mean Satan soul has
always<00:03:29.109> been<00:03:29.230> shown<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.470> be<00:03:29.620> some<00:03:29.829> form<00:03:30.010> of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
always been shown to be some form of

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.309 
always been shown to be some form of
demonic<00:03:30.579> form<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.269> this<00:03:31.569> popping<00:03:32.019> up<00:03:32.139> now

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
demonic form and so this popping up now

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.140 
demonic form and so this popping up now
it<00:03:32.829> does<00:03:33.040> make<00:03:33.280> sense<00:03:33.310> because<00:03:33.880> there<00:03:34.060> was

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
it does make sense because there was

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.629 
it does make sense because there was
really<00:03:34.329> no<00:03:34.510> time<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.959> past<00:03:35.139> for<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.549> know

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
really no time in the past for you know

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.250 
really no time in the past for you know
Mira<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.150> ever<00:03:37.329> say<00:03:37.569> she<00:03:37.780> had<00:03:37.870> diamond

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
Mira to ever say she had diamond

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.569 
Mira to ever say she had diamond
particles<00:03:38.470> running<00:03:38.980> Brewer<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.220> mean<00:03:39.430> she

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
particles running Brewer I mean she

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.009 
particles running Brewer I mean she
really<00:03:39.760> didn't<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.239> mean<00:03:40.359> why<00:03:40.510> would<00:03:40.720> she<00:03:40.840> say

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
really didn't I mean why would she say

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.349 
really didn't I mean why would she say
that<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:42.100> makes<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.670> lot<00:03:42.819> of<00:03:42.850> sense<00:03:42.940> with<00:03:43.269> it

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
that so it makes a lot of sense with it

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.629 
that so it makes a lot of sense with it
popping<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.019> just<00:03:44.170> it's<00:03:44.319> weird<00:03:44.500> but<00:03:45.190> it

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
popping up it's just it's weird but it

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.099 
popping up it's just it's weird but it
makes<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.970> lot<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.150> sense<00:03:46.269> because<00:03:46.720> she's<00:03:46.900> had

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
makes a lot of sense because she's had

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.809 
makes a lot of sense because she's had
that<00:03:47.350> type<00:03:47.799> of<00:03:47.829> ability<00:03:48.160> since<00:03:48.549> damn

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
that type of ability since damn

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.610 
that type of ability since damn
