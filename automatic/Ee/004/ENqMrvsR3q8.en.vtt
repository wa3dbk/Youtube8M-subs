00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
in the UK now it's this their mark to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.330 
in the UK now it's this their mark to
cabinet<00:00:36.030> making<00:00:36.239> chisel<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.829> has<00:00:37.950> fine

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
cabinet making chisel and it has fine

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.450 
cabinet making chisel and it has fine
tool<00:00:38.820> steel<00:00:39.149> hardened<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> about<00:00:40.469> rockwell<00:00:40.950> 60

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
tool steel hardened to about rockwell 60

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
tool steel hardened to about rockwell 60
so<00:00:41.760> nice<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> hard<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> you'll<00:00:43.379> notice<00:00:43.590> on

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so nice and hard and you'll notice on

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180 
so nice and hard and you'll notice on
the<00:00:44.010> sides<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:45.020> they<00:00:46.020> ground<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.770> almost

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the sides here they ground down almost

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
the sides here they ground down almost
to<00:00:47.670> nothing<00:00:48.090> which<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.690> perfect<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.410> getting

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to nothing which is perfect for getting

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.299 
to nothing which is perfect for getting
into<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> corner<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.489> dovetails<00:00:51.829> also<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
into the corner of dovetails also the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.200 
into the corner of dovetails also the
main<00:00:53.699> bevel<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.390> ground<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.320> 25<00:00:55.739> degrees<00:00:56.219> which

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
main bevel is ground at 25 degrees which

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
main bevel is ground at 25 degrees which
means<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> come<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> sharpen<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
means that when you come to sharpen the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
means that when you come to sharpen the
bevels<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.539> you're<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.680> honing

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
bevels there you're actually just honing

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
bevels there you're actually just honing
the<00:01:02.219> tip<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> preparation<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.140> side

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the tip so the preparation of that side

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.880 
the tip so the preparation of that side
of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> blade<00:01:05.010> doesn't<00:01:05.519> take<00:01:05.820> long<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.180> all

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
of the blade doesn't take long at all

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
of the blade doesn't take long at all
equally<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> reverse<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.299> blade<00:01:09.540> what

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
equally on the reverse of the blade what

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.730 
equally on the reverse of the blade what
they've<00:01:10.530> done<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.130> -<00:01:11.400> ever<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.240> slightly

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
they've done is - ever so slightly

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.590 
they've done is - ever so slightly
hollow<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.250> back<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.270> almost

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
hollow out the back here it's almost

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.990 
hollow out the back here it's almost
imperceptible<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.430> means<00:01:17.670> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
imperceptible but what that means is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
imperceptible but what that means is
that<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.479> come<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.020> flatten<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> back

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that when you come to flatten the back

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.719 
that when you come to flatten the back
of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> chisel<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.009> starts<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
of the chisel that the it starts to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.030 
of the chisel that the it starts to
remove<00:01:24.060> material<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.710> right

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
remove material here which is right

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
remove material here which is right
where<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.400> want<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.540> initial

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
where you want it so the initial

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530 
where you want it so the initial
preparation<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> chisel<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.670> very

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
preparation of the chisel is is very

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.560 
preparation of the chisel is is very
quick<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.619> easy<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> I'd<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> show

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
spend hours flattening the backs of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.630 
spend hours flattening the backs of
chisels<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.710> may<00:01:40.890> come<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
chisels this may come as a bit of a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:02:00.940 
chisels this may come as a bit of a
surprise<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.060> you

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.050 

so<00:02:01.460> we<00:02:01.549> can<00:02:01.700> see<00:02:01.880> there<00:02:02.119> how<00:02:03.820> straightaway

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
so we can see there how straightaway

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.899 
so we can see there how straightaway
all<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:06.080> grinding<00:02:06.290> scratches<00:02:07.040> have<00:02:07.700> been

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
all the grinding scratches have been

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.170 
all the grinding scratches have been
removed<00:02:08.179> from<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.569> tip<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> chisel<00:02:10.180> that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
removed from the tip of the chisel that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.479 
removed from the tip of the chisel that
back<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.569> flat<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.349> it's<00:02:12.530> time<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:12.980> go<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
back is flat and it's time to go on to

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:30.090 
back is flat and it's time to go on to
the<00:02:13.730> next<00:02:13.849> stone

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.960 

so<00:02:31.100> flipping<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.610> over<00:02:32.920> onto<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.040> 13,000

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so flipping that over onto the 13,000

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:48.830 
so flipping that over onto the 13,000
grit

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.090 

and<00:02:49.840> there<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.200> have<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.380> that's<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
and there you have it that's the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.630 
and there you have it that's the
flattest<00:02:52.350> quickest<00:02:53.350> possible<00:02:56.640> back

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
flattest quickest possible back

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.840 
flattest quickest possible back
sharpening<00:02:59.160> so<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.640> do<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.000> bevel

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.790 

let's<00:03:06.850> simply<00:03:07.240> attach<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.540> guide<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.530> 30

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
let's simply attach the guide up to 30

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:26.990 
let's simply attach the guide up to 30
degrees

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
and though it is so in about 90 seconds

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.890 
and though it is so in about 90 seconds
from<00:03:57.740> taking<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.220> out<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.580> packet<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.150> is
