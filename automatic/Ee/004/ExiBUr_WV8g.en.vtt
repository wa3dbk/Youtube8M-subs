think about doing that so yeah with the
two<00:04:50.880> powers<00:04:51.539> combined<00:04:51.900> upgraded<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.620> mega<00:04:53.009> ring

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
two powers combined upgraded a mega ring

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.939 
two powers combined upgraded a mega ring
and<00:04:53.550> now<00:04:53.759> underground<00:04:54.479> mega<00:04:54.720> stones<00:04:55.020> well<00:04:55.830> he

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
and now underground mega stones well he

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.360 
and now underground mega stones well he
meant<00:04:56.130> white<00:04:56.370> all<00:04:56.940> throughout<00:04:57.630> Kalos<00:04:58.409> even<00:04:59.190> in

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370

meant white all throughout Kalos even in
areas<00:04:59.909> that<00:05:00.440> seemed<00:05:01.440> very<00:05:01.469> unlikely<00:05:01.919> they'd

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
areas that seemed very unlikely they'd

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.499 
areas that seemed very unlikely they'd
be<00:05:02.550> at<00:05:03.830> I'll<00:05:04.830> show<00:05:05.039> you<00:05:05.159> why<00:05:05.580> in<00:05:05.940> another<00:05:06.210> video
