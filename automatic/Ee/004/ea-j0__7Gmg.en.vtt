00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
temperament like when when Tim Bradley

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.719 
temperament like when when Tim Bradley
starts<00:00:57.139> pressing<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:58.100> got<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.339> press<00:00:58.489> back

between<00:01:06.530> Roy<00:01:07.520> Jones<00:01:07.700> jr.<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.420> Erik<00:01:08.630> Morales

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
between Roy Jones jr. and Erik Morales

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.120 
between Roy Jones jr. and Erik Morales
and<00:01:09.110> middle<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.440> camp<00:01:09.650> actually<00:01:10.010> had

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
and middle of the camp actually had

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.290 
and middle of the camp actually had
something<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.460> do<00:01:10.520> with<00:01:10.550> that<00:01:10.760> I<00:01:10.790> mean<00:01:11.120> I<00:01:11.150> don't

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
something to do with that I mean I don't

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.450 
something to do with that I mean I don't
know<00:01:11.570> it's<00:01:12.020> not<00:01:12.170> ideal<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:12.980> know<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.160> want<00:01:13.400> to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
know it's not ideal you know you want to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.100 
know it's not ideal you know you want to
try<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:13.790> your<00:01:13.910> camp<00:01:14.150> in<00:01:14.360> order<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:14.930> stuff

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
try to have your camp in order and stuff

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.370 
try to have your camp in order and stuff
like<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:16.930> mean<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:17.990> think<00:01:18.020> it's<00:01:18.260> just

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
like that but I mean I think it's just

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.810 
like that but I mean I think it's just
more<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.620> temperament<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.100> Vargas<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.700> know

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
more the temperament of Vargas you know

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.090 
more the temperament of Vargas you know
he<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.480> think<00:01:20.990> he<00:01:21.200> felt<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.530> intensity<00:01:22.010> from

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
he I think he felt the intensity from

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.560 
he I think he felt the intensity from
Tim<00:01:22.310> Bradley<00:01:22.730> and<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:22.940> don't<00:01:23.090> think<00:01:23.240> he<00:01:23.330> wanted

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
Tim Bradley and I don't think he wanted

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.450 
Tim Bradley and I don't think he wanted
really<00:01:23.840> want<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.170> press<00:01:24.440> in<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.800> match<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
really want it to press in and match the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.850 
really want it to press in and match the
intensity<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.970> Timothy<00:01:26.300> now<00:01:27.200> first<00:01:27.710> off

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
intensity of Timothy now first off
