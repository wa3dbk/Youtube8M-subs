going<00:03:13.020> we<00:03:14.020> decided<00:03:14.380> these<00:03:14.590> another<00:03:15.010> because

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
going we decided these another because

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.850 
going we decided these another because
it's<00:03:18.040> obviously<00:03:18.910> always<00:03:19.180> nighter<00:03:19.630> on<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.620> men

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
it's obviously always nighter on the men

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.930 
it's obviously always nighter on the men
we<00:03:21.040> could<00:03:21.300> use<00:03:22.890> glass<00:03:23.890> everywhere<00:03:24.550> so<00:03:24.820> we

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
we could use glass everywhere so we

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.310 
we could use glass everywhere so we
could<00:03:25.090> see<00:03:25.300> if<00:03:25.480> there<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.810> blockage

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
could see if there is a blockage

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.380 
could see if there is a blockage
anywhere<00:03:27.000> at<00:03:28.000> one<00:03:28.180> point<00:03:28.360> we<00:03:28.510> had<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:30.180> block<00:03:31.180> in

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
anywhere at one point we had a block in

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.449 
anywhere at one point we had a block in
the<00:03:31.450> wrong<00:03:31.600> place<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.440> held<00:03:32.800> them<00:03:33.100> all<00:03:33.250> up

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
the wrong place and it held them all up

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.410 
the wrong place and it held them all up
and<00:03:33.670> we

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
and we

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.410 
and we
hot<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.470> big<00:03:35.760> right<00:03:37.200> 55<00:03:38.200> levels<00:03:38.680> or<00:03:38.920> what<00:03:39.790> 15

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
hot this big right 55 levels or what 15

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:50.309 
hot this big right 55 levels or what 15
levels<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.989> I'll<00:03:41.110> go<00:03:41.260> again<00:03:49.140> don't<00:03:50.140> think

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
levels and I'll go again don't think

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.930 
levels and I'll go again don't think
this<00:03:50.470> will<00:03:50.590> be<00:03:50.650> as<00:03:50.890> much<00:03:51.100> but<00:03:51.400> yeah<00:03:53.550> out<00:03:54.550> of<00:03:54.760> all

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
this will be as much but yeah out of all

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.809 
this will be as much but yeah out of all
a<00:03:54.970> lot<00:03:55.980> 16<00:03:56.980> levels<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:59.280> basically<00:04:00.280> here<00:04:00.700> we

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
a lot 16 levels so basically here we

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.850 
a lot 16 levels so basically here we
have<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.900> zombie<00:04:02.739> Pigman<00:04:03.130> sponnish<00:04:03.640> on<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:05.709> you

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
have it zombie Pigman sponnish on to you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.410 
have it zombie Pigman sponnish on to you
water<00:04:06.099> swish<00:04:06.400> blocks<00:04:06.700> that<00:04:06.910> bring<00:04:07.150> them<00:04:07.300> all

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
water swish blocks that bring them all

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.559 
water swish blocks that bring them all
down<00:04:10.920> bring<00:04:11.920> them<00:04:12.100> down<00:04:12.310> here<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.819> then<00:04:13.150> they

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
down bring them down here and then they

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.390 
down bring them down here and then they
go<00:04:13.600> up<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.790> tar<00:04:17.040> basically<00:04:18.040> in<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:19.419> normal

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
go up this tar basically in the normal

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.120 
go up this tar basically in the normal
mode<00:04:21.400> way<00:04:21.700> they<00:04:22.060> jump<00:04:22.389> constantly<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.889> that's

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
mode way they jump constantly so that's

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.590 
mode way they jump constantly so that's
water<00:04:25.139> alternate<00:04:26.139> just<00:04:27.010> bring<00:04:27.940> some<00:04:28.060> right<00:04:28.450> up

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
water alternate just bring some right up

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.350 
water alternate just bring some right up
the<00:04:28.750> top<00:04:29.010> they<00:04:30.010> go<00:04:30.190> across<00:04:30.460> there<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:33.360> this

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
the top they go across there in this

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.090 
the top they go across there in this
sort<00:04:35.229> of<00:04:35.290> wave<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.919> then<00:04:36.210> fall<00:04:37.210> down<00:04:37.510> and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
sort of wave and then fall down and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.460 
sort of wave and then fall down and
there's<00:04:39.100> certain<00:04:39.460> amount<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.700> blocks<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:41.320> they

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
there's certain amount of blocks so they

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.750 
there's certain amount of blocks so they
fall<00:04:41.770> on<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.370> leaves<00:04:42.880> them<00:04:43.060> with<00:04:43.240> how<00:04:43.419> hard

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
fall on it leaves them with how hard

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.060 
fall on it leaves them with how hard
that<00:04:45.760> means<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.539> basically<00:04:47.260> punch<00:04:47.830> them

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
that means you can basically punch them

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.659 
that means you can basically punch them
unless<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.700> die<00:04:49.740> if<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.010> can<00:04:51.160> get<00:04:51.310> them<00:04:51.490> but

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
unless you die if you can get them but

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.860 
unless you die if you can get them but
zombie<00:04:54.669> Pigman<00:04:55.060> are<00:04:55.210> but<00:04:55.360> stronger<00:04:55.840> than

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
zombie Pigman are but stronger than

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.860 
zombie Pigman are but stronger than
normal<00:04:56.200> zombies<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:57.010> yeah<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.300> that's<00:04:58.479> why<00:04:58.690> we

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
normal zombies so yeah so that's why we

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.610 
normal zombies so yeah so that's why we
use<00:04:59.310> either<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.490> bow<00:05:00.760> which<00:05:01.390> would<00:05:01.690> be<00:05:01.870> as<00:05:02.440> you

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
use either a bow which would be as you

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.260 
use either a bow which would be as you
