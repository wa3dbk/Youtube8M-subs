00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.410
 one solved all boy I'm from 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.850
 gameplay in this video I'm going to show 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.100
 two new tricks that I've been 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.449
 sharing enough gta 5 tricks 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.810
 all week long 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.410
 these two tricks because the first one 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.929
 flame incendiary bullets and the second one 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.630
 flame explosive bullets are well 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.360
 similar you already know by the name of that 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.040
 comes the thing more or less then and now 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.290
 same in the bottom pot of the screen 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.170
 are seeing the first trick that is the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.340
 of the incendiary bullets occupied 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.340
 flamingos so it's called 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.680
 only works only for playstation 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 that remind you just for station 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.960
 3 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.610
 I'm going to activate the trick using that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.380
 I'll show you how it works 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.420
 and quick I'll show you the other one 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.220
 it's the explosive bullets this is the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.330
 flaming bullet trick to power 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.720
 made a 3 would be l 1 r 1 square r 13 and 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.240
 is next r2p cr1 the Shiites next 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.479
 square 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.509
 and says trick activated bullets teeth 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.570
 let's try it here in a way 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.509
 Discreet, let's hope that the more 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.960
 under two or three people it begins 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.960
 and the police 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.729
 you do not let me explain everything 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.719
 and you events because it turns on 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:39.549
 flames and you shoot a volcano see how 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.110
 flames are ignited also that's the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.000
 first trick which is in it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.190
 they now have in the spoils 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.990
 was the opposite 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.120
 and remember only when it seems done 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.190
 then the second trick is called bullets 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.870
 explosive good looking but instead of 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.750
 instead of setting fire to what they do 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.910
 a small next 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.700
 this is a little more powerful with just one 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.710
 shot you can try a truck a car 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.230
 whatever and of course kill from a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.970
 just bullet 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.970
 to enemies to people 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.630
 it would be happy and it is next to square xp 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.680
 if it's next to r1 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 r2 although I did manifest it square 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.350
 explicit in the r1 r2 in the office 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.000
 since in it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.400
 in the square d 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 in ecuador is not there does not appear as 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.530
 what not 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.740
 with a gun a single shot then the 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.900
 vehicles 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.440
 and also killed the policemen the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.440
 enemies of 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.250
 a single bullet in a gun the trick 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.799
 as I say you have it 2 bottom of the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.959
 screen and you can activate it a bit a 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.959
 moment that is the history 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.820
 Well, guys, these are both 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.130

 exclusion and have a lot of fun 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.240
 as they see the chaos that they can create is 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.040
 pretty big at the moment I 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.740
