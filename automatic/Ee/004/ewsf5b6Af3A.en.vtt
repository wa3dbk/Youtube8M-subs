00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
time I've actually tried to do this this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.970 
time I've actually tried to do this this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is a like I said be a bronze so it's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
is a like I said be a bronze so it's
pretty<00:01:02.430> easy<00:01:02.670> under<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> hammer<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.750> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
pretty easy under the hammer and you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.380 
pretty easy under the hammer and you
could<00:01:04.019> actually<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.040> type<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
could actually get that type of

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.520 
could actually get that type of
extension<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.510> draw<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.049> material

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
extension or draw on the material

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.280 
extension or draw on the material
without<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.670> cracking<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.750> gave<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
without it cracking actually gave it a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.600 
without it cracking actually gave it a
pretty<00:01:10.439> good<00:01:10.710> workout<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.369> worked<00:01:11.520> out

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
pretty good workout and it worked out

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.219 
pretty good workout and it worked out
pretty<00:01:11.729> good<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.150> let's<00:01:12.570> take<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> quick<00:01:12.960> listen

because<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:44.220> their<00:02:44.670> durability<00:02:44.880> but<00:02:45.870> also

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
because of their durability but also

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.229 
because of their durability but also
