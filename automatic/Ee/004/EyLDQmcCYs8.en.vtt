00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 good day is in front of me 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.130
 the phone is called evo 4g + and the main 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.769
 feature of this device is not 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 screen 4 3 inches then very good 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.320
 quality not operating system android 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.170
 the fact that this phone can work 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 simultaneously in two networks gsm and cdma 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 2000 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.500
 Now I will show you how it is 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.500
 looks under the hood 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.770
 parse 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.770
 the parade understands like this 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.060
 here one can see two slots for a queen 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.930
 ruim card left and right 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.440
 7 Sep for gsm maybe here can 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.630
 work 3g which is w-cdma and what not 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.100
 check we have time then write the text 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.100
 we are sitting and also 2000 are calling someone one x 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.140
 and the video is all the same thing 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.720
 talks about the data transfer format of it 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.360
 the presence of i am new standard in 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 general option the phone can work in 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.020
 more networks than others 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.070
 for example 2 sim card phones 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.280
 here you can insert a sim card 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.940
 intertelecom 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 either overwhelms if it is Ukraine and 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.479
 enjoy cheer presatostat screensaver 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.020
 we see the sprint while loading it 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.270
 loaded I would like to tell a little 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:49.300
 appearance and body of this device 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.429
 it is made of black plastic back 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.130
 the side is a little to the touch 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.369
 rubberized 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.619
 in from this side is corrugated plastic here 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.590
 we already see the inscription 820 then probably 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.200
 the inscription is made more for the image because 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.240
 that the camera is claimed here 5 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 megapixels are really here 3 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.840
 megapixel camera here we see 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.870
 LED flash and on others 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.080
 sides of the action the camera call button 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.200
 rocker volume control from the top 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.810
 side of the standard connector where three s 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.930
 half millimeter jack headset 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.319
 power button here on the left connector under 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.880
 exercise 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 this micro yusbi bottom nothing on 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.110
 front panel here 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.980
 we see the output of the sensor is a camera camo 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.270
 three pixels for video conferencing and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.540
 touch controls this button 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.230
 Home buttons do not call the option back and 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.550
 power on search button immediately 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:09.010
 I will show you the screen viewing angles 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:13.209
 not even the bad qualities of the great 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.790
 of the screen phone I was surprised to me 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.209
 I liked it and despite the resolution of 480 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.340
 at 800 everything is very clearly visible brightness 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.670
 enough and viewing angles too 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.569
 enough and other characteristics 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.660
 he will show here and now boot 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.750
 he works from c 1810 parrot 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.000
 performance basically they 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.670
 great performance but the main thing 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.130
 the dignity of this apparatus is how he 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.519
 works with networks further details 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.900
 described his hotel 4g + manufacturer 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.410
 Processor qualcomm process system itself 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.370
 777 and cafe 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.670
 800 MHz frequency and collected by 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.620
 arm v6 architecture 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.930
 to the screen resolution and already told 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.489
 further there is a graphics accelerator 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.040
 adreno 200 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.220
 memory oz 512 megabytes all this just 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.120
 and 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.579
 affects performance now what 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.850
 As for the camera, I'll show you 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.270
 a couple of shots 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.200
 By the way the camera I mentioned are called 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.200
 separate button 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:45.770
 camera is required restart try 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.770
 differently 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:59.139
 perhaps there is a glitch because of what it costs 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:05.469
 to 16 gigabyte memory card 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.469
 quite likely it is poorly supported 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.180
 here are the pictures that were taken earlier 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:31.180
 our tree can be seen three and a half pixels 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:35.230
 no 5 8 pack bring all the labels 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.290
 well read and with the packaging and so with 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.750
 the monitor screen in the album of course seams 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.460
 these photos do not put on the note 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.340
 you can shoot some 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.130
 Further I would like to say a few words about 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.560
 packaging this about the device looks 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.520
 it is like that 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.120
 hard cardboard Here is such a 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:02.190
 equipment here here is velvety 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.860
 the substrate immediately see the protective film 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.810
 instruction in chinese 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.290
 extra battery capacity of it 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:20.260
 by the way 2290 milliamps hour if you believe 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:23.250
 written here headset lace and 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.620
 lesbian on micro and beat here such 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:32.100
 charging further 200 feels some more 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.100
 document on it all thank you for your attention
