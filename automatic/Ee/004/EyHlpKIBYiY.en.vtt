00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
timer there I can go into the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.360 
timer there I can go into the
multitasker<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.500> toggle<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.220> we

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
multitasker and that toggle that we

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.949 
multitasker and that toggle that we

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
talked about absolute your toggle

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.140 
talked about absolute your toggle
basically<00:02:29.739> if<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:29.950> tap<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.430> actual<00:02:30.760> icon

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
see the new a green light right there it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.320 
see the new a green light right there it
means<00:02:33.459> it's<00:02:33.580> going<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.730> stay<00:02:33.940> running<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.269> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
means it's going to stay running in the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.699 
means it's going to stay running in the
background<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:34.989> is<00:02:35.110> one<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.500> uses

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
background so this is one of the uses
