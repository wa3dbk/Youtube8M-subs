that correctly well I know the digit

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
that correctly well I know the digit
light<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.820> you've<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.180> something<00:01:00.510> else<00:01:00.660> here

Andrew<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.199> correct<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> division<00:01:05.369> here

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
Andrew that's correct the division here

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
Andrew that's correct the division here
actually<00:01:05.790> officially<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> digital<00:01:06.960> ID

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
as the digital I was so it's the drop in

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.520 
as the digital I was so it's the drop in
plug-and-play<00:01:12.420> replacement<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
safety capability we've got an emergency

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
safety capability we've got an emergency
level<00:01:19.500> button<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> we've<00:01:19.950> added<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.369> OSHA

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
level button that we've added the OSHA

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
level button that we've added the OSHA

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.429 
button wings level zero vertical speed
we've<00:01:23.700> also<00:01:23.880> added<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.509> neat<00:01:24.659> feature<00:01:24.840> altitude

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
we've also added a neat feature altitude

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.460 
we've also added a neat feature altitude
select<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.159> push<00:01:26.759> alt<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> autopilot<00:01:27.810> dial

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
select so push alt on the autopilot dial

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.429 
select so push alt on the autopilot dial
in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> altitude<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:30.259> enter<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
in the altitude you want enter that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.069 
in the altitude you want enter that
number<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.790> set<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.299> vertical<00:01:33.900> speed

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
number and then set your vertical speed

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.440 
number and then set your vertical speed
psi<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.460> climbing<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> this

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
psi and now you are climbing to this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
psi and now you are climbing to this
selected<00:01:36.990> altitude<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.799> vertical<00:01:38.250> speed

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
selected altitude at this vertical speed

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.270 
selected altitude at this vertical speed
so<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.720> arbitrary<00:01:40.170> whole<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.710> level

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so the arbitrary whole I up and level

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.219 
so the arbitrary whole I up and level
off<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> that'll<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.869> also<00:01:43.020> goes

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
off and that'll be a it also goes

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
products or all two axes correct so for

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.480 
products or all two axes correct so for
most<00:04:39.360> people<00:04:39.750> that's<00:04:39.900> yet<00:04:40.560> completely<00:04:41.100> flying

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
most people that's yet completely flying

or something and apply your there that's

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.480 
or something and apply your there that's
right<00:04:49.169> think<00:04:49.620> it's<00:04:49.740> time<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.919> get<00:04:50.190> time<00:04:50.370> to

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
right think it's time to get time to

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.740 
right think it's time to get time to
read<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.700> manual<00:04:51.030> on<00:04:51.060> how<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.240> use<00:04:51.450> this<00:04:51.600> stuff

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
read the manual on how to use this stuff

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.260 
read the manual on how to use this stuff
oh<00:04:52.200> I'm<00:04:52.919> just<00:04:53.100> kidding<00:04:53.220> about<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.760> pay

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
oh I'm just kidding about that pay

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.750 
oh I'm just kidding about that pay
attention<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.810> your<00:04:54.870> fly<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:56.370> told<00:04:56.550> me<00:04:56.700> about

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
attention to your fly you told me about

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.900 
attention to your fly you told me about
a<00:04:56.910> level<00:04:57.270> button<00:04:57.810> one<00:04:58.740> button<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.430> things

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
a level button one button and things

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.000 
a level button one button and things
kind<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.210> get<00:05:00.300> calm<00:05:00.600> but<00:05:00.900> what's<00:05:01.260> how<00:05:01.800> do<00:05:01.860> you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
kind of get calm but what's how do you

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.600 
kind of get calm but what's how do you
figure<00:05:02.190> that

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
figure that

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.450 
figure that
right<00:05:02.820> well<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.240> AP<00:05:03.600> level<00:05:03.930> feature<00:05:04.140> is<00:05:04.500> the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
right well the AP level feature is the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.029 
right well the AP level feature is the
feature<00:05:06.090> that's<00:05:06.360> becoming<00:05:07.200> fairly<00:05:07.440> common<00:05:07.950> in

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
feature that's becoming fairly common in

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.969 
feature that's becoming fairly common in
the<00:05:08.130> auto<00:05:08.280> pilot<00:05:08.460> world<00:05:08.789> today<00:05:09.180> actually<00:05:09.979> you

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
the auto pilot world today actually you

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.320 
the auto pilot world today actually you
get<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.160> little<00:05:11.370> bit<00:05:11.430> disoriented<00:05:11.880> maybe<00:05:12.240> a

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
get a little bit disoriented maybe a

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.900 
get a little bit disoriented maybe a
thin<00:05:12.539> advert<00:05:12.780> in<00:05:12.870> IMC<00:05:13.380> push<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.430> AP<00:05:14.700> level

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
thin advert in IMC push the AP level

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.029 
thin advert in IMC push the AP level
button<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:15.900> rolls<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.260> wings<00:05:16.470> level<00:05:16.590> and

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
button and it rolls to wings level and

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.279 
button and it rolls to wings level and
zero<00:05:17.250> vertical<00:05:17.669> speed<00:05:17.850> so<00:05:18.210> if<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.169> were<00:05:19.260> a

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
zero vertical speed so if you were a

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.750 
zero vertical speed so if you were a
little<00:05:19.440> bit<00:05:19.620> disoriented<00:05:20.010> if<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.280> started<00:05:20.640> a

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
little bit disoriented if you started a

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.219 
little bit disoriented if you started a
turn<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.120> know<00:05:21.240> that<00:05:21.390> death<00:05:21.630> spiral<00:05:22.080> that

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
turn you know that death spiral that

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:22.940 
turn you know that death spiral that
does

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
does

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.390 
does
that's<00:05:23.340> where<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.640> problem<00:05:24.000> starts<00:05:24.330> right<00:05:24.930> so

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
that's where the problem starts right so

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.890 
that's where the problem starts right so
so<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.580> AP<00:05:26.820> level<00:05:26.970> button<00:05:27.270> is<00:05:27.420> a<00:05:27.450> way<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.750> just

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
so the AP level button is a way to just

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.150 
so the AP level button is a way to just
push<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.470> button<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.860> autopilot

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
push the button in the autopilot

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.610 
push the button in the autopilot
whatever<00:05:29.670> it<00:05:29.880> was<00:05:30.120> doing<00:05:30.480> whether<00:05:31.170> it<00:05:31.290> was<00:05:31.410> on

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
whatever it was doing whether it was on

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.530 
whatever it was doing whether it was on
or<00:05:31.860> off<00:05:32.040> doesn't<00:05:32.670> matter<00:05:32.820> whatever<00:05:33.060> mode<00:05:33.390> it

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
or off doesn't matter whatever mode it

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.820 
or off doesn't matter whatever mode it
within<00:05:33.690> oh<00:05:34.020> is<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.350> Russian<00:05:34.590> no<00:05:34.650> matter

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
within oh is that Russian no matter

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.220 
within oh is that Russian no matter
where<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.310> are<00:05:35.520> one<00:05:36.180> button<00:05:36.540> push<00:05:36.750> button

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
where you are one button push button

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.780 
where you are one button push button
push<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.680> it's<00:05:37.800> wink<00:05:38.040> level<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.610> here<00:05:38.760> a

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
push and it's wink level and here a

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.100 
push and it's wink level and here a
vertical<00:05:38.940> fee<00:05:39.360> that's<00:05:39.630> a<00:05:39.720> pretty<00:05:39.900> nice<00:05:40.080> thing

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
vertical fee that's a pretty nice thing

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.050 
vertical fee that's a pretty nice thing
a<00:05:40.440> lot<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.770> these<00:05:40.860> auto<00:05:41.340> pilots<00:05:41.730> are<00:05:41.850> being

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
a lot of these auto pilots are being

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.460 
a lot of these auto pilots are being
used<00:05:42.300> by<00:05:42.510> guys<00:05:42.750> at<00:05:42.960> light-sport<00:05:43.380> aircraft

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
used by guys at light-sport aircraft

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.610 
used by guys at light-sport aircraft
some<00:05:44.340> are<00:05:44.520> some<00:05:44.880> are<00:05:45.030> IFR<00:05:45.570> capable<00:05:46.140> it's<00:05:46.440> still

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
some are some are IFR capable it's still

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.370 
some are some are IFR capable it's still
like<00:05:46.770> using<00:05:46.980> an<00:05:47.160> autopilot<00:05:47.580> but<00:05:47.910> you<00:05:48.720> know<00:05:48.870> you

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
like using an autopilot but you know you

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.050 
like using an autopilot but you know you
think<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.710> can<00:05:49.860> always<00:05:50.070> stay<00:05:50.430> out<00:05:50.580> of<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.790> cloud

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
think you can always stay out of a cloud

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.970 
think you can always stay out of a cloud
until<00:05:51.540> you<00:05:51.630> find<00:05:51.930> yourself<00:05:52.050> in<00:05:52.500> one<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:52.890> you
