00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
this limit something happens and you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.330

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
them as adversaries I just saw them as

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.350 
them as adversaries I just saw them as
other<00:02:58.260> people<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.890> racetrack<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.549> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
more I raised the more I realized that I

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.050 
more I raised the more I realized that I
was<00:03:03.870> completely<00:03:04.200> against<00:03:04.650> myself<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.519> my<00:03:06.030> own

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
was completely against myself and my own

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.300 
was completely against myself and my own
and<00:03:06.390> abilities<00:03:06.989> taught<00:03:07.799> me<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.950> wasn't<00:03:08.160> a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
and abilities taught me I wasn't a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.210 
and abilities taught me I wasn't a
mortal<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.819> know<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:10.010> when<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.069> make

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
mortal you know that when you make

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.009 
mortal you know that when you make
mistakes<00:03:11.610> out<00:03:11.849> there<00:03:11.880> bad<00:03:12.269> things<00:03:12.360> happen

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
mistakes out there bad things happen

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.300 
mistakes out there bad things happen
sometimes<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.130> really<00:03:14.489> bad<00:03:15.049> danger<00:03:16.069> well<00:03:17.069> of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
sometimes is really bad danger well of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.210 
sometimes is really bad danger well of
course<00:03:18.019> but<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.200> are<00:03:19.260> missing<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.890> very

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
course but you are missing a very

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.700 
course but you are missing a very
important<00:03:20.819> point

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
important point

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.390 
important point
I<00:03:21.770> think<00:03:22.610> if<00:03:23.000> any<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.600> us<00:03:23.750> imagined<00:03:24.590> we<00:03:25.130> lead

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
I think if any of us imagined we lead

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.450 
I think if any of us imagined we lead
imagine<00:03:26.030> what<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:27.020> would<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:27.380> like<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:28.100> go<00:03:28.280> into

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
imagine what it would be like to go into

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.920 
imagine what it would be like to go into
a<00:03:28.610> tree<00:03:28.970> at<00:03:29.950> 150<00:03:30.950> miles<00:03:31.160> an<00:03:31.400> hour<00:03:31.660> we<00:03:32.660> would

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
a tree at 150 miles an hour we would

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.380 
a tree at 150 miles an hour we would
probably<00:03:33.260> never<00:03:33.710> get<00:03:34.040> into<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.490> cars<00:03:34.760> at<00:03:35.120> all

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
probably never get into the cars at all

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.160 
probably never get into the cars at all
none<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.440> us<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.910> has<00:03:38.060> always<00:03:38.330> seemed<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.960> me

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
none of us so it has always seemed to me

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.400 
none of us so it has always seemed to me
that<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:40.040> do<00:03:40.160> something<00:03:40.610> very<00:03:40.640> dangerous

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
that to do something very dangerous

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.990 
that to do something very dangerous
requires<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.860> certain<00:03:44.110> absence<00:03:45.110> of

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
requires a certain absence of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.900 
requires a certain absence of
imagination<00:03:47.000> maybe<00:03:47.740> to<00:03:48.740> do<00:03:49.070> something<00:03:49.670> that

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
imagination maybe to do something that

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.290 
imagination maybe to do something that
brings<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.440> close<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.520> possibility

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
brings you so close to the possibility

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.290 
brings you so close to the possibility
of<00:03:53.330> death<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.290> survive<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.860> is<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:56.120> feel

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
of death and to survive it is to feel

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.410 
of death and to survive it is to feel
life<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.200> living<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.340> much<00:03:58.400> more<00:03:58.760> intensely

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
life and living so much more intensely
