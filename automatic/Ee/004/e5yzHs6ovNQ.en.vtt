the map no one of the most important

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.179 
the map no one of the most important
things<00:01:51.299> I've<00:01:51.479> learned<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:52.350> using<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> KSG

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
things I've learned with using the KSG

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.940 
things I've learned with using the KSG
is<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> tactical<00:01:54.930> equipment<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.590> use<00:01:55.619> know

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is what a tactical equipment to use know

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130 
is what a tactical equipment to use know
the<00:01:56.100> TAC<00:01:56.340> equipment<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.990> actually

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the TAC equipment that I use is actually

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
the TAC equipment that I use is actually
shocked<00:01:58.799> charges<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> reason<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
shocked charges now the reason for this

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.940 
shocked charges now the reason for this
is<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:00.990> you're<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> stun

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
is because you know you're going to stun

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.020 
is because you know you're going to stun
the<00:02:01.979> enemy<00:02:02.369> they're<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.000> able

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the enemy they're not going to be able

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.370 
the enemy they're not going to be able
to<00:02:03.299> move<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.079> able<00:02:04.200> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
killstreaks that i want to talk about is

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.650 
killstreaks that i want to talk about is
the<00:03:44.970> UAV<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:46.350> hunter<00:03:47.100> killer<00:03:47.280> drone<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.269> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
the UAV the hunter killer drone and the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.420 
the UAV the hunter killer drone and the
Guardian<00:03:49.290> know<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.739> reason<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.370> is

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
Guardian know the reason for this is

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.509 
Guardian know the reason for this is
because<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:52.170> Guardian<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.799> actually<00:03:53.250> one<00:03:53.489> of

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
because the Guardian is actually one of

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.300 
because the Guardian is actually one of
the<00:03:53.900> best<00:03:54.900> kill<00:03:55.350> streaks<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.950> game<00:03:56.130> I

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the best kill streaks in the game I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.340 
the best kill streaks in the game I
believe<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.819> know<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.359> UAV<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.230> can

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
believe you know the UAV just so you can

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.990 
believe you know the UAV just so you can
find<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.709> enemy<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.160> what<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.670> want<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.910> do

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
