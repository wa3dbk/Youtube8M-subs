person<00:00:43.950> playing<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.399> predator<00:00:44.820> had<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
person playing the predator had that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.790 
person playing the predator had that
down<00:00:45.570> packed<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:47.160> liked<00:00:47.399> how<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> fight

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
down packed I really liked how the fight

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
down packed I really liked how the fight
was<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:50.160> back<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> forth<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
was going back and forth you know you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.639 
was going back and forth you know you
had<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> lot<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.300> Wolverine<00:00:54.989> evading

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
had a lot of you know Wolverine evading

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.729 
had a lot of you know Wolverine evading
the<00:00:55.770> predator<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.910> know<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the predator you know and then the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.279 
the predator you know and then the
predator<00:00:59.250> had<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> hard<00:00:59.789> time<00:00:59.910> trying<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> find

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
predator had a hard time trying to find

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
predator had a hard time trying to find
them<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.420> Wolverine<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
them because you know Wolverine as a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
them because you know Wolverine as a
hunter<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.860> he<00:01:05.070> knows<00:01:05.250> what<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
hunter so he knows what to do the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.050 
hunter so he knows what to do the
predator<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.540> also<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> hunter<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> thought

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
predator is also a hunter so I thought

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.620 
predator is also a hunter so I thought
the<00:01:09.299> matchup<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.350> interesting<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:12.180> had

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the matchup was pretty interesting I had

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
the matchup was pretty interesting I had
a<00:01:12.659> feeling<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.560> Wolverine<00:01:14.340> was<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.729> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a feeling that Wolverine was going to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.249 
a feeling that Wolverine was going to
win<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.509> doubt<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.810> my<00:01:15.960> mind

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
win there was no doubt in my mind

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.050 
win there was no doubt in my mind
because<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.810> his<00:01:18.810> regenerative<00:01:20.060> capabilities

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
because of his regenerative capabilities

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.550 
because of his regenerative capabilities
he<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.509> regenerate<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> predator<00:01:23.430> cannot

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
he can regenerate the predator cannot

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.289 
he can regenerate the predator cannot
Wolverine<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> anum<00:01:26.280> antium<00:01:26.729> inside<00:01:27.119> of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
Wolverine has a anum antium inside of

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.450 
Wolverine has a anum antium inside of
him<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.640> loose<00:01:30.590> for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.619> predator<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
him so it's loose for the predator but I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.700 
him so it's loose for the predator but I
thought<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> idea<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.600> interesting<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
thought the idea was very interesting I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.609 
thought the idea was very interesting I
liked<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.909> they<00:01:36.210> were<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.049> doing<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
liked how they were you know doing a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.580 
liked how they were you know doing a
hand-to-hand<00:01:38.040> combat<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.990> fight<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
hand-to-hand combat in the fight and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100 
hand-to-hand combat in the fight and
then<00:01:40.799> ultimately<00:01:41.150> Wolverine<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.990> know

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
then ultimately Wolverine just you know

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.710 
then ultimately Wolverine just you know
killed<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.299> claws

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
killed them you know with the claws

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.670 
killed them you know with the claws
through<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> jaw<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.460> ultimately<00:01:48.680> coming

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
through the jaw and ultimately coming

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.289 
through the jaw and ultimately coming
out<00:01:49.829> through<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> head<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> thought<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.119> was

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
out through the head I thought that was

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.520 
out through the head I thought that was
a<00:01:51.390> great<00:01:51.540> finish<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.780> predator

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
a great finish and then how the predator

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.859 
a great finish and then how the predator
had<00:01:55.740> already<00:01:55.979> set<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.670> bomb<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
had already set that bomb up because the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.679 
had already set that bomb up because the
predator<00:01:58.320> knew<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:59.670> he<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> lose

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
predator knew that he was going to lose

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
predator knew that he was going to lose
Wolverine<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.649> probably<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.490> toughest<00:02:02.939> stain

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Wolverine is probably the toughest stain

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.170 
Wolverine is probably the toughest stain
that<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.479> predator<00:02:04.369> encountered<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.969> had

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that the predator encountered so we had

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.399 
that the predator encountered so we had
a<00:02:06.210> feeling<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> lose

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
a feeling that it was going to lose

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.380 
a feeling that it was going to lose
predators<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.129> very<00:02:08.340> intelligent<00:02:08.729> too<00:02:09.209> by

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
predators are very intelligent too by

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.610 
predators are very intelligent too by
the<00:02:09.420> way<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.020> liked<00:02:10.800> how<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.099> got

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
the way I liked how you got

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.890 
the way I liked how you got
has<00:02:11.819> showed<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.330> fight<00:02:13.599> how

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
has showed that in the fight how

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.070 
has showed that in the fight how
intelligent<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.739> predator<00:02:15.129> was<00:02:15.340> and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
intelligent the predator was and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.660 
intelligent the predator was and
figuring<00:02:17.080> out<00:02:17.230> Wolverines<00:02:17.799> movements<00:02:18.459> bring

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
figuring out Wolverines movements bring

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.240 
figuring out Wolverines movements bring
out<00:02:18.849> when<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.390> where<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.629> shoot<00:02:19.989> him<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:21.099> know

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
out when and where to shoot him you know
