and now take tape again a masking tape
is<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.119> lot<00:01:21.270> better<00:01:21.450> than<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.320> we're<00:01:22.680> just

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is a lot better than this but we're just

put<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> onto<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> bottom<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> board

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.780 

like<00:01:35.159> so
