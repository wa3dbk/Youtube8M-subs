00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.419
 to this exhibition 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.449
 that he was brought from Perm so 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.109
 a lot of new 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.099
 roughly speaking 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.640
 each creature a pair of extremists kitchenette 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.640
 brought her already established model 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.869
 prince Vladimir 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.199
 but mostly r 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.570
 mainly focused on 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.810
 checking properties as usual 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.900
 let's say so crudely but not on 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
 educating the client she explanations that 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.670
 why our works 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.480
 paints portraits continuation of the same 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 the work that I spend his principle of Moscow 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.970
 development of the theme of screw construction prices 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.100
 clinton construction 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.370
 so how are some rules 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.760
 the biggest thing we brought here is 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.570
 desire to talk and talk with people 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.030
 with those who do stab wounds 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.590
 thats just that we ended up talking to 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.540
 one grinder but very interesting 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.050
 the conversation was 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.430
 so he communication brought communication 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.330
 more communication than it will be 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.290
 profitable to attract a 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 in terms of money is also pretty good 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.579
 as usually very few tons left 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.000
 products per year 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.290
 on a trip myself bought her exhibition format 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.290
 let's say so and they are rather unexpected 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.150
 aroused interest among visitors 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.900
 there have not seen such an influx 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.140
 quite interesting 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.100
 he is a husband prince Vladimir percent let's say so 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 custom-made creative group 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.140
 All our cartoons Prince Vladimir 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.220
 foreign party 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.360
 we have been made impersonal 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.770
 that is, they did not take them from the master of the days 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.910
 cooked 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.210
 ordered in one Moscow company 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.080
 By the way, an order of 200 kilograms is cooked. 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.210
 The composition is approximate then 75 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.229
 by 14 00 msk 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.539
 25 kilograms 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.889
 because it leaves on a limited party 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.529
 175 pounds we have to learn dreams 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.929
 but with 80 kilograms of the word remains the museum 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.499
 do and 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.519
 kitchen knives and its inhabitants 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.510
 quite well to combine is not interesting 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.469
 happened 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.369
 mister bye this stuff 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.309
 the amount by the way here is brought 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.309
 he made just this stuff 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.489
 what else is she 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.049
 a release is planned 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.999
 presentation series of thirty 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.079
 stylized knives 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.239
 even a survey of services 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.539
 customer 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.589
 able indicators 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:56.349
 special views like 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.949
 looked about that 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.429
 of course too 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.569
 from my point of view, Moscow and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.699
 green card designs 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.139
 built nii have there their own possible 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.149
 customers customer ie 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.639
 was developed by goats symbolism 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.839
 paganism and 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.459
 Slavic 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.459
 these are myths and legends and fairy tales access were 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.619
 but mostly work was done by 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.259
 tracks 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.639
 I am just a company in my line 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.079
 of opportunities 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.069
 tried to attract some people 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.499
 which 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.069
 in varying degrees of ownership 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.630
 historical material 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.439
 reconstructive 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.439
 in march owned constructional 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.339
 what tonara practices for this 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.559
 topic
