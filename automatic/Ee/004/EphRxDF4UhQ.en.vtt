playing another card I want to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.870

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
game and so the best way to do that is

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.280 
game and so the best way to do that is
actually<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.850> blockade<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.020> enemy

I'm going to hit select

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.760 
I'm going to hit select
and<00:01:58.730> as<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.240> can<00:01:59.360> see<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.840> supply<00:02:00.140> head<00:02:00.500> go

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
and as you can see the supply head go

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.730 
and as you can see the supply head go
you<00:02:01.040> know<00:02:01.160> takes<00:02:01.970> on<00:02:02.120> a<00:02:02.200> faded<00:02:03.200> kind<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.530> color

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
you know takes on a faded kind of color

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.160 
you know takes on a faded kind of color
that<00:02:04.670> means<00:02:04.850> that's<00:02:05.030> no<00:02:05.240> longer<00:02:05.540> active<00:02:05.960> and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
that means that's no longer active and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.790 
that means that's no longer active and
the<00:02:07.130> hex<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.610> adjacent<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.050> are<00:02:09.080> also<00:02:09.380> now

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
the hex is adjacent to it are also now

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.850 
the hex is adjacent to it are also now
out<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.280> supply<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:11.930> they<00:02:12.170> can't<00:02:12.530> be<00:02:12.590> used

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
out of supply and so they can't be used

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.100 
out of supply and so they can't be used
for<00:02:13.070> certain<00:02:13.220> functions<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.910> game<00:02:14.110> so

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
for certain functions in the game so

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.990 
for certain functions in the game so
that<00:02:15.290> those<00:02:15.500> are<00:02:15.680> how<00:02:16.070> supply<00:02:16.460> lines<00:02:16.760> work

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that those are how supply lines work

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.240 
that those are how supply lines work
basically<00:02:17.570> if<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.870> can't<00:02:18.140> trace<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.710> path<00:02:19.010> of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
basically if you can't trace a path of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.270 
basically if you can't trace a path of
friendly<00:02:19.870> hexes<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.830> your<00:02:21.920> supply

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
friendly hexes to one of your supply

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.250 
friendly hexes to one of your supply
heads<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:23.150> hex<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.600> going<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.960> be<00:02:24.050> out<00:02:24.140> of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
heads that hex is going to be out of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.170 
heads that hex is going to be out of
supply<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:25.370> now<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> enemy<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.090> attacking

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
supply so now the enemy is attacking

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.530 
supply so now the enemy is attacking
they<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.590> option<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.640> capturing<00:02:29.090> one<00:02:29.210> of

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
they have the option of capturing one of

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.530 
they have the option of capturing one of
the<00:02:29.630> three<00:02:29.990> hexes<00:02:30.770> outlined<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.550> green<00:02:31.580> if<00:02:32.060> I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the three hexes outlined in green if I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.440 
the three hexes outlined in green if I
don't<00:02:32.720> block<00:02:33.400> I'm<00:02:34.400> going<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.880> go<00:02:35.000> ahead<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
don't block I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.180 
don't block I'm going to go ahead and
pass<00:02:35.660> even<00:02:36.290> though<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> resources<00:02:37.070> to

pass even though I have the resources to

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.190 
pass even though I have the resources to
block<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.700> show<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:37.940> what<00:02:38.060> happens<00:02:38.390> so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
block just to show you what happens so

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.570 
block just to show you what happens so
as<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.560> they've<00:02:39.860> captured<00:02:40.160> this

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
as you can see they've captured this

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.090 
as you can see they've captured this
supply<00:02:40.940> head<00:02:41.180> hex<00:02:41.420> now<00:02:42.320> it's<00:02:42.470> my<00:02:42.590> turn<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.830> play

see I can choose from one of four cards

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.820 
see I can choose from one of four cards
let's<00:03:14.120> go<00:03:14.239> ahead<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.540> select<00:03:14.720> Tommy's<00:03:15.380> and

let's go ahead and select Tommy's and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.910 
let's go ahead and select Tommy's and
that'll<00:03:16.610> be<00:03:16.700> added<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.269> my<00:03:17.420> hand

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
that'll be added to my hand

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.800 
that'll be added to my hand
now<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.160> enemy's<00:03:19.550> plane<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.000> barrage<00:03:20.269> blimps

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
now the enemy's plane the barrage blimps

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.080 
now the enemy's plane the barrage blimps
card<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:21.980> an<00:03:22.250> important<00:03:22.880> card

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
card and this is an important card

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.120 
card and this is an important card
because<00:03:23.390> this<00:03:23.570> decreases<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.230> air<00:03:24.500> range<00:03:24.890> of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
because this decreases the air range of

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.120 
because this decreases the air range of
one<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.400> my<00:03:25.580> supply<00:03:26.239> had<00:03:26.420> X's<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.989> can<00:03:27.590> see<00:03:27.890> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
one of my supply had X's you can see the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.920 
one of my supply had X's you can see the
light<00:03:28.459> blue<00:03:28.670> tint<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.269> map<00:03:29.570> that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
light blue tint on the map that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.930 
light blue tint on the map that
represents<00:03:30.590> all<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.920> hexes<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.430> are<00:03:31.550> within

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
represents all the hexes that are within

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.020 
represents all the hexes that are within
the<00:03:32.120> air<00:03:32.269> range<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.840> my<00:03:33.050> supply<00:03:33.470> head<00:03:33.739> hexes<00:03:34.160> if

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
the air range of my supply head hexes if

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.229 
the air range of my supply head hexes if
they<00:03:35.180> decrease<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.780> range<00:03:36.140> then<00:03:37.239> fewer

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
they decrease that range then fewer

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.390 
they decrease that range then fewer
hexes<00:03:38.690> I'll<00:03:39.170> be<00:03:39.290> able<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.500> reach<00:03:39.650> fewer<00:03:39.950> hexes

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
hexes I'll be able to reach fewer hexes

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.699 
hexes I'll be able to reach fewer hexes
from<00:03:41.060> my<00:03:41.239> supply<00:03:41.630> heads<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.200> that's

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
from my supply heads and that's

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.900 
from my supply heads and that's
important<00:03:43.160> because<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.400> won't<00:03:43.610> be<00:03:43.670> able<00:03:43.790> to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
important because I won't be able to

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.390 
important because I won't be able to
place<00:03:44.060> certain<00:03:44.239> cards<00:03:44.810> on<00:03:44.989> those<00:03:45.350> hexes<00:03:45.830> so

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
place certain cards on those hexes so

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.780 
place certain cards on those hexes so
let's<00:03:46.610> go<00:03:46.760> ahead<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.269> block<00:03:48.040> now<00:03:49.040> finally<00:03:49.580> I'm
