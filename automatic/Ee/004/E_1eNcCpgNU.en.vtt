00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:01.079 
it's probably gonna make the read that

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.810 
it's probably gonna make the read that
he<00:00:01.260> doesn't<00:00:01.530> have<00:00:01.680> these<00:00:02.010> right<00:00:02.310> now<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.730> he

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
he doesn't have these right now and he

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.940 
he doesn't have these right now and he
has<00:00:02.850> two<00:00:03.030> top<00:00:03.210> jacket<00:00:03.449> but<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> way<00:00:04.890> to

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
has two top jacket but that is a way to

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.400 
has two top jacket but that is a way to
lose<00:00:05.220> also<00:00:05.549> if<00:00:06.000> he<00:00:06.150> does<00:00:06.330> top<00:00:06.540> deck<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.140> you

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
lose also if he does top deck it so you

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.570 
lose also if he does top deck it so you
also<00:00:07.560> want<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.770> clear<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.010> board<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.490> think

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.640 
also want to clear the board so I think
fleury<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.059> must<00:00:09.300> regardless<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.230> think<00:00:10.290> you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650

hmm yeah I think you just have to oil
here<00:01:43.399> oil<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.759> backstab

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.690 

because<00:01:51.380> you'd<00:01:51.500> only<00:01:51.680> have<00:01:51.830> one<00:01:52.100> out<00:01:52.280> he<00:01:52.580> would

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
because you'd only have one out he would

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.250 
because you'd only have one out he would
have<00:01:52.729> you'll<00:01:53.300> be<00:01:53.450> able<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.600> tap<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.050> he<00:01:54.140> would

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
have you'll be able to tap and he would

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.540 
have you'll be able to tap and he would
have<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.560> draw<00:01:54.710> healbot<00:01:55.100> he<00:01:55.280> would<00:01:55.370> have<00:01:55.460> to

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
have to draw healbot he would have to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.480 
have to draw healbot he would have to
feel<00:01:55.729> but<00:01:55.850> in<00:01:55.909> this<00:01:55.970> next<00:01:56.150> two<00:01:56.300> cards<00:01:57.490> so

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
feel but in this next two cards so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.490 
feel but in this next two cards so
backstab<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.540> mean<00:01:59.840> that's<00:01:59.960> going<00:02:00.320> face

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
backstab I mean that's going face

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.660 
backstab I mean that's going face
regardless<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.070> think<00:02:04.190> it's<00:02:04.369> gonna<00:02:04.490> come

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
regardless so I think it's gonna come

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.050 
regardless so I think it's gonna come
down<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.180> draw<00:02:06.369> from<00:02:07.369> no<00:02:07.580> Stan<00:02:08.860> he<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:10.220> ya

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
down to this draw from no Stan he get ya

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.840 
down to this draw from no Stan he get ya

but you'd probably SI it I don't know
something<00:04:24.290> like<00:04:24.410> that<00:04:25.480> it's<00:04:26.480> interesting<00:04:26.630> oh

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
something like that it's interesting oh

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.910 
something like that it's interesting oh
man<00:04:29.330> it's<00:04:29.660> real<00:04:30.080> close<00:04:32.200> basis<00:04:33.200> he<00:04:33.470> faces<00:04:33.890> the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920
