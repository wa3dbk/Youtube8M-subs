00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
of water if you think it needs it or a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.710 
of water if you think it needs it or a
little<00:01:56.040> bit<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.250> flour<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:57.180> sure<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> put<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
little bit of flour make sure you put a

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.120 
little bit of flour make sure you put a
little<00:01:57.930> bit<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.170> file<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.710> hand<00:01:58.920> before

so<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.250> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.549> looks<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.299> strange

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
so it kind of looks a little strange

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.749 
so it kind of looks a little strange
I've<00:02:04.200> added<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.159> bit<00:02:05.369> more<00:02:05.520> flour<00:02:05.700> to
