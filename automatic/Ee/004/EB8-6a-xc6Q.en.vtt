00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 Today I will tell you a story about how I 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.660
 sowed seeds beautifully 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.360
 It means beaut thread usa has I dreamed 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.920
 very one 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.190
 crust per se collector on 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.270
 Ukraine is very little here you meet while 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:38.680
 would be in the collection, there are little blue but it 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:43.420
 messing micro synergies imagine 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 23 centimeter plant in 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.080
 diameter 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.089
 adult plant that also blooms 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.640
 like down the ninges by these little ones 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:57.220
 their bells are not many varieties 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.100
 but really this big rarity and 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.089
 the amateur has rare Gesner colleagues then 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.240
 there are can meet and legs 12 site on 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.940
 reddene not leg consent of course easier 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.410
 with these houses more often brings 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.790
 rare plants and there are opportunities 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:23.570
 buy buy collector ep3 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.340
 kosmey and simple such blue little club 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.100
 of love 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.350
 interesting varieties we certainly move away 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.700
 a little harder but meeting love would 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.670
 wish if 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.620
 if you write maniac, then of course I am any 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.760
 killed before you open this same 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.180
 verified city 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:49.370
 and finally i will get some seeds 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:51.770
 pretty to 7 inga vidok near the village 9 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.150
 got hold of sachets 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.940
 boards when the dust is even a millimeter 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.600
 millimeter blame the seeds do not reach and 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.570
 you imagine my show never 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.430
 we sow the seeds of such microscopic 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.570
 of plants 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.570
 but something had to be done with them 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.580
 of course I started to panic and start 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.239
 find out from everyone how it is done 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.650
 As for well, let's say that's it 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.330
 small small seeds of heart plants 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.820
 tsukuri he then or there live out 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.810
 saintpaulus how do they settle down so is taken 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.540
 we are a white sheet of paper poured seeds 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.190
 they mix either with dry ground 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.430
 either with sand and neatly so 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.409
 formed to conduct smoke 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.730
 so your 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.879
 and so here in the center these wake up 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.680
 seeds or verse are sown in the ground 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.910
 together snowy sand yes and pattern and 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.430
 then unevenly distributed then 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.310
 surface wet families from 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.150
 are planted absolutely nothing from above they are not 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.250
 wake up 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.049
 to make it easier for them to germinate because 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.400
 that the small seeds of her cinema is difficult difficult 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.060
 break through great servants 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.269
 and so they do not sprout 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.750
 here the seeds themselves were of this size 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.359
 what I could hardly imagine from what 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.400
 you can mix 700 such 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.370
 get out of this bag because you 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.920
 sachet but the usual such visit sachet 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.269
 small somehow more finger 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.160
 freeze and and how generally they don't even 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:42.970
 get out of this bag 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:46.959
 and here was a lot of smart advice in general 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.829
 and you decided to use the color they 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.780
 roller light twinkle little take a toothpick 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.669
 just yes and a toothpick neatly here 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.980
 So 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.950
 get every every seed is from 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.590
 bag and then neatly so 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.940
 direct and immediately she will fall into 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.239
 land I took just such teplichku I 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.690
 was such a box with a lid, here I am 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.810
 decided it myself 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:19.160
 organize under the jovani greenhouse I 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:23.480
 filled the ground with cool perlite 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.750
 mixed good moistened from 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.360
 spray gun on sprinkled 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.330
 here and here in this here adme.ru 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.990
 i thus caused these seeds and 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.990
 There was a little about 10 pieces probably 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.800
 toothpick and so neat 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.910
 neatly it was amazing 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.200
 jewelry work 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.140
 I embroidered them you try the plot 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:58.070
 bring them to the camera don't know will focus 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:05:00.280
 on or not of course without a camera very 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.050
 hard to see 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.630
 germinating seeds without insane 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:11.450
 small size I'll show you on 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:13.610
 Photos are looking for then I embroidered them 17 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.669
 August 17 for 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.950
 thank you August 31, after all, almost 2 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.720
 weeks gone his fall two weeks 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:28.310
 tentatively they began to germinate here 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.580
 these here and when I saw these just a moment 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.580
 microbe checks are so green 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.710
 there was no limit to my joy because 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.620
 I actively say I do not believe that micro 1 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.470
 but never had such experience yet 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.020
 ate such a trifle 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.470
 still micro synergies really want 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.080
 get your collection and see 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.969
 what is this miracle 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.319
 real life 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:59.569
 that's when they increase a little 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:03.349
 in volume I will continue my story and 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.029
 I'll show you what they look like next 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.739
 before picking here when they already 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:09.739
 grow up a little they can catch 

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:11.049
 arrange in his own map or 

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:15.969
 just for a distance 

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:15.969
 certain that they do not grow in piles 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.789
 if this video was helpful to you 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.190
