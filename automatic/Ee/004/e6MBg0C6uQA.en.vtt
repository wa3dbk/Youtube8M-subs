00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
let's see yeah I don't think it really

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.479 
let's see yeah I don't think it really
requires<00:00:42.370> like<00:00:42.580> our<00:00:42.850> muscle<00:00:43.330> it's<00:00:43.450> more<00:00:43.780> core

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
requires like our muscle it's more core

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.910 
requires like our muscle it's more core
muscle<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.610> my<00:00:45.730> opinion<00:00:46.380> so<00:00:47.380> first<00:00:47.710> that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
muscle in my opinion so first that

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.770 
muscle in my opinion so first that
you're<00:00:48.040> gonna<00:00:48.130> do<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.430> you're<00:00:48.580> gonna<00:00:48.720> try<00:00:49.720> to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
you're gonna do is you're gonna try to

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.150 
you're gonna do is you're gonna try to
get<00:00:49.930> comfortable<00:00:50.290> see<00:00:50.650> where<00:00:50.860> your<00:00:50.980> arm

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
get comfortable see where your arm

get comfortable see where your arm
position<00:00:51.610> is<00:00:51.700> going<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:51.910> be<00:00:51.970> so<00:00:52.960> if<00:00:53.050> you're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
position is going to be so if you're

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.750 
position is going to be so if you're
right-handed<00:00:53.500> like<00:00:54.129> if<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.370> do<00:00:54.489> all<00:00:54.640> your

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
so first let's try by practicing by

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
so first let's try by practicing by
lifting<00:02:05.800> our<00:02:06.069> left<00:02:06.250> leg<00:02:06.429> up

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.670 

lift<00:02:13.500> your<00:02:13.680> left<00:02:13.920> leg<00:02:14.040> up<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.560> when

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
lift your left leg up with this and when

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.110 
lift your left leg up with this and when
you<00:02:16.739> get<00:02:16.860> used<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.129> this<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.340> slipped<00:02:17.819> up<00:02:17.940> you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you get used to this you slipped up you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.199 
you get used to this you slipped up you
can<00:02:18.269> change<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.750> write<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.180> write

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
can change it to write and you write

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.670 
can change it to write and you write
without<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> breath<00:02:24.900> when<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.170> first<00:02:25.349> do<00:02:25.530> that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
without a breath when you first do that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.520 
without a breath when you first do that
just<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.159> it<00:02:26.430> does<00:02:26.989> really<00:02:27.989> squeeze

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
just because it does really squeeze

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.479 
just because it does really squeeze
squeeze<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.519> breath<00:02:29.760> how<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.000> use<00:02:30.239> but<00:02:31.489> yeah

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
squeeze the breath how to use but yeah

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.399 
squeeze the breath how to use but yeah
but<00:02:32.879> after<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.269> start<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.690> get<00:02:33.870> lighter<00:02:34.200> on

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
but after you start to get lighter on

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.770 
but after you start to get lighter on
your<00:02:34.560> arms<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.849> will<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.120> much<00:02:36.299> easier<00:02:36.329> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
your arms then it will be much easier to

your arms then it will be much easier to
stay<00:02:37.379> balanced<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.890> won't<00:02:38.040> hurt<00:02:38.159> your

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.619 
stay balanced and it won't hurt your
stomach<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:39.000> won't<00:02:39.150> run<00:02:39.239> out<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.480> breath

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
stomach and you won't run out of breath

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.830 
stomach and you won't run out of breath
this<00:02:39.750> quickly<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.579> third<00:02:41.940> step<00:02:42.239> we're

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
this quickly so now a third step we're

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.449 
this quickly so now a third step we're
actually<00:02:42.959> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> try<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> bring<00:02:43.739> we're

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
actually going to try to bring we're

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.250 
actually going to try to bring we're
gonna<00:02:44.549> keep<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:44.910> leg<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:45.599> we<00:02:45.989> feel

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
maybe you can just say comp with that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.559 
maybe you can just say comp with that
and<00:03:02.280> that's<00:03:02.430> how<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.879> may<00:03:03.030> look<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.390> might<00:03:03.540> be

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
and that's how it may look I might be

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.449 
and that's how it may look I might be
kind<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.900> bent<00:03:04.109> that's<00:03:04.739> still<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.159> very<00:03:05.190> good

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
kind of bent that's still a very good

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.550 
kind of bent that's still a very good
start<00:03:05.959> considering<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.409> your

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
start considering that you have your

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.580 
start considering that you have your
body<00:03:07.769> off<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.519> ground<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.349> after

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
body off the ground and then so after

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.960 
body off the ground and then so after
that<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:10.980> really<00:03:11.190> just<00:03:11.220> want<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.609> keep<00:03:11.760> on

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
that you really just want to keep on

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.020 
that you really just want to keep on
trying<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.109> like<00:03:13.260> I'm<00:03:14.099> not<00:03:14.159> like<00:03:14.459> pretending

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
trying to like I'm not like pretending

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.199 
trying to like I'm not like pretending
but<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:16.230> your<00:03:16.379> leg<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:17.099> pull<00:03:17.549> your<00:03:17.730> leg<00:03:17.970> up

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
but have your leg like pull your leg up

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.509 
but have your leg like pull your leg up
towards<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.660> sky<00:03:18.889> so<00:03:19.889> your<00:03:20.040> body<00:03:20.310> isn't<00:03:20.910> like

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
towards the sky so your body isn't like

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.449 
towards the sky so your body isn't like
I<00:03:23.519> guess<00:03:24.389> I<00:03:24.510> caught<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.959> like<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.470> just

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
I guess I caught that like this just

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.869 
I guess I caught that like this just
looks<00:03:26.639> weird<00:03:27.859> so<00:03:28.859> that<00:03:29.010> it'll<00:03:29.220> be<00:03:29.370> more

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
looks weird so that it'll be more

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.159 
looks weird so that it'll be more
straight<00:03:30.180> doesn't<00:03:30.389> have<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.569> be<00:03:30.660> perfectly

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
straight doesn't have to be perfectly

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.140 
straight doesn't have to be perfectly
straight<00:03:31.519> because<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.879> just<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
straight because this is just the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.940 
straight because this is just the
foundation<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.810> do<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.049> turtle<00:03:34.379> or<00:03:34.560> like<00:03:34.709> walk

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
foundation to do the turtle or like walk

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.280 
foundation to do the turtle or like walk
backwards<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.510> whenever<00:03:36.750> they're<00:03:36.959> gonna<00:03:37.169> do

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
backwards but whenever they're gonna do

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.750 
backwards but whenever they're gonna do
the<00:03:37.379> freeze<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.709> want<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:37.919> keep<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> clean<00:03:38.430> so

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
the freeze you want to keep it clean so

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.699 
the freeze you want to keep it clean so
you<00:03:39.419> just<00:03:39.629> go<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:39.959> just<00:03:40.109> go<00:03:40.319> into<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.620> like

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
you just go and just go into it like

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.680 
you just go and just go into it like
this<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.579> then<00:03:41.699> just<00:03:41.910> try<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.150> keep<00:03:42.299> your<00:03:42.359> legs

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
