00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.840 
getting really overcrowded and there's
just<00:00:16.500> really<00:00:16.710> hard<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.100> water<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> do

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
just really hard to water and do

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.370 
just really hard to water and do
everything<00:00:18.270> else<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> decided<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> take

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
everything else so I decided to take

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
everything else so I decided to take
everything<00:00:19.770> else<00:00:20.010> out<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.430> clean<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.420> also

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
everything else out and clean it I also

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.130 
everything else out and clean it I also
noticed<00:00:22.170> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.980> bug<00:00:23.550> or<00:00:23.820> mite<00:00:24.140> infestation

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
noticed kind of bug or mite infestation

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080 
noticed kind of bug or mite infestation
so<00:00:25.170> another<00:00:25.680> reason<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.070> took<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
so another reason I took these out is so

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.890 
so another reason I took these out is so
I<00:00:27.150> could<00:00:27.240> spray<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.199> neem<00:00:28.439> oil<00:00:28.880> but

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
I could spray them all with neem oil but

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.970 
I could spray them all with neem oil but
since<00:00:30.900> I'm<00:00:31.080> growing<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> Trinidad<00:00:31.949> Moruga

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
since I'm growing the Trinidad Moruga

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060 
since I'm growing the Trinidad Moruga
scorpion<00:00:32.399> both<00:00:33.300> outdoors<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.260> indoors<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
scorpion both outdoors and indoors I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.420 
scorpion both outdoors and indoors I
figured<00:00:35.430> I'd<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.940> show<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.950> differences

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
figured I'd just show the differences

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.810 
figured I'd just show the differences
between<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:39.059> outdoor<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.690> indoor<00:00:39.780> plants

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820

brought<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.730> outside

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
brought it outside

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.340 
brought it outside
first<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:17.050> was<00:02:17.290> my<00:02:17.440> best<00:02:17.620> point<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
first and it it was my best point and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.610 
first and it it was my best point and
it's<00:02:20.350> still<00:02:21.310> has<00:02:21.580> these<00:02:22.060> curled<00:02:22.510> leaves<00:02:22.810> all

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
it's still has these curled leaves all

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's still has these curled leaves all
over<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.040> place<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.640> deform<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.510> leaves<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
over the place just deform the leaves it

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.030 
over the place just deform the leaves it
has<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.370> yellowing<00:02:28.320> all<00:02:29.320> these<00:02:29.590> plants<00:02:29.950> have

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
has the yellowing all these plants have

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.360 
has the yellowing all these plants have
yellowing<00:02:30.900> some<00:02:31.900> worse<00:02:32.080> than<00:02:32.350> others<00:02:32.650> but

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
yellowing some worse than others but

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.420 
yellowing some worse than others but
they're<00:02:33.550> all<00:02:33.580> about<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.120> same<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:36.160> one<00:02:36.310> is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
they're all about the same this one is

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.520 
they're all about the same this one is
pretty<00:02:36.610> bad<00:02:36.910> yellowing<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.200> indoor

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
pretty bad yellowing but the indoor

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.980 
pretty bad yellowing but the indoor
plants<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.280> leaves<00:02:39.490> are<00:02:39.730> all<00:02:39.850> healthy<00:02:40.660> green

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
plants the leaves are all healthy green

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.020 
plants the leaves are all healthy green
I<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.920> no<00:02:42.370> idea<00:02:42.640> what<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.300> cause<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.990> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
I have no idea what the cause of the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.850 
I have no idea what the cause of the
cause<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:47.020> mean<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.380> thought<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.740> was

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
cause of that is I mean I thought it was

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.500 
cause of that is I mean I thought it was
a<00:02:47.890> sulfur<00:02:48.400> deficiency<00:02:48.550> or<00:02:49.270> an<00:02:49.360> iron

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
a sulfur deficiency or an iron

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
a sulfur deficiency or an iron
deficiency<00:02:51.420> could<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:53.010> over<00:02:54.010> fertilization

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
deficiency could be over fertilization

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.190 
deficiency could be over fertilization
which<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.960> doubt<00:02:56.920> because<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.670> have<00:02:58.030> some<00:02:58.330> pepper

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
which I doubt because I have some pepper

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.680 
which I doubt because I have some pepper
plants<00:02:59.740> or<00:03:00.070> habanero<00:03:00.850> pepper<00:03:01.120> plant<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.510> bought

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
plants or habanero pepper plant I bought

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.020 
plants or habanero pepper plant I bought
from<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.990> store<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.980> hasn't<00:03:03.400> been<00:03:03.670> given

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
from the store that hasn't been given

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.630 
from the store that hasn't been given
any<00:03:04.300> fertilizer<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.290> still<00:03:06.250> has<00:03:06.430> these

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
any fertilizer and it still has these

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.820 
any fertilizer and it still has these
curled<00:03:06.970> leaves<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.230> if<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.410> guys<00:03:08.500> know<00:03:08.800> what

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
curled leaves so if you guys know what

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.700 
curled leaves so if you guys know what
the<00:03:09.070> cause<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.790> I'd<00:03:10.090> love<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.480> know

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
the cause of that is I'd love to know

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.250 
the cause of that is I'd love to know
but<00:03:11.710> um<00:03:11.890> yeah<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.790> indoor<00:03:13.120> plants<00:03:13.570> are<00:03:13.750> ten

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
but um yeah the indoor plants are ten

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.920 
but um yeah the indoor plants are ten
times<00:03:14.500> healthier<00:03:15.160> than<00:03:15.340> these<00:03:15.750> these<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:16.900> a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
times healthier than these these are a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.480 
times healthier than these these are a
lot<00:03:17.080> sturdier<00:03:17.410> than<00:03:18.090> these<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.570> just<00:03:20.470> put<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
lot sturdier than these I just put the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.910 
lot sturdier than these I just put the
forth<00:03:21.760> fan<00:03:22.060> in<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.480> tent<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.170> hopefully<00:03:23.740> that

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
forth fan in the tent so hopefully that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.920 
forth fan in the tent so hopefully that
will<00:03:24.010> help<00:03:24.300> strengthen<00:03:25.300> these<00:03:25.660> guys<00:03:25.990> up<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.620> bit

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
will help strengthen these guys up a bit

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.150 
will help strengthen these guys up a bit
I'm<00:03:28.930> using<00:03:29.260> cal-mag<00:03:30.130> along<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:32.160> normal

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
I'm using cal-mag along with a normal

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.890 
I'm using cal-mag along with a normal
fertilizer<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:34.470> fertilize<00:03:35.470> these<00:03:36.190> plants

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
fertilizer to fertilize these plants

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.180 
fertilizer to fertilize these plants
yeah<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.020> just<00:03:38.290> thought<00:03:38.560> I'd<00:03:38.620> show<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.100> guys

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.150 
yeah I just thought I'd show you guys
the<00:03:39.490> differences<00:03:40.000> between<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.600> indoor<00:03:41.160> and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
the differences between the indoor and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.660 
the differences between the indoor and
outdoor<00:03:42.610> Trinidad<00:03:43.150> Moruga<00:03:43.180> scorpion

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
outdoor Trinidad Moruga scorpion

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.640 
outdoor Trinidad Moruga scorpion
um<00:03:45.670> it's<00:03:46.390> my<00:03:46.540> first<00:03:46.750> time<00:03:47.050> growing<00:03:47.350> hot

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
um it's my first time growing hot

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.560 
um it's my first time growing hot
peppers<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:49.090> been<00:03:49.270> a<00:03:49.300> learning

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
peppers so it's been a learning

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.070 
peppers so it's been a learning
experience<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.800> entire<00:03:51.250> time<00:03:52.080> but

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
experience this entire time but

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.110 
experience this entire time but
hopefully<00:03:53.440> all<00:03:53.920> these<00:03:54.340> will<00:03:54.550> do<00:03:54.700> well<00:03:54.910> I'm

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
hopefully all these will do well I'm

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.340 
hopefully all these will do well I'm
getting<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.480> little<00:03:55.630> concerned<00:03:55.930> though

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
getting a little concerned though

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.540 
getting a little concerned though
because<00:03:57.959> it's<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.350> end<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.620> July<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.280> none<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
because it's the end of July and none of

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.640 
because it's the end of July and none of
these<00:04:00.640> have<00:04:01.000> started<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.840> produce<00:04:01.990> fruit<00:04:02.410> yet

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
these have started to produce fruit yet

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.970 
these have started to produce fruit yet
and<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.040> would<00:04:03.250> really<00:04:03.520> really<00:04:04.180> be<00:04:04.540> upset<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:05.860> I

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
and I would really really be upset if I

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.860 
and I would really really be upset if I
didn't<00:04:06.220> get<00:04:06.370> any<00:04:06.550> peppers<00:04:07.030> out<00:04:07.240> of<00:04:07.390> these<00:04:07.510> but

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
didn't get any peppers out of these but

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.949 
didn't get any peppers out of these but
I'm<00:04:08.350> sure<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.709> indoor<00:04:09.010> ones<00:04:09.220> will<00:04:09.520> in<00:04:09.730> time<00:04:10.570> I

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
I'm sure the indoor ones will in time I

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.030 
I'm sure the indoor ones will in time I
just<00:04:11.260> might<00:04:11.410> have<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.590> change<00:04:11.860> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
just might have to change the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.210 
just might have to change the
photoperiod<00:04:12.490> but<00:04:13.360> anyway<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.990> is<00:04:14.200> my<00:04:14.410> indoor

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
photoperiod but anyway that is my indoor

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.970
