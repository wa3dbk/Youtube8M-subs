00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.980
 brake tracks 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.640
 I have a big message for you 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.250
 a little less attention to the newspaper and 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.980
 some more attention to your bowel movements and 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.280
 see where you can adjust with nutrition 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.280
 and lifestyle 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.880
 it drives and lives for balance 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.490
 everything you do there will give you energy 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.440
 of whether it costs energy 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.520
 the art is to make life small 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.720
 to hold 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.330
 focus on vital issues and avoid noise 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.400
 if you follow the herd you walk in the 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.740
 shit of others 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:17.560
 follow your own picks what's your job 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.139
 what do you want to convey in your life 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.260
 do you connect with your power or give 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.810
 your strength can be removed with a stone 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.669
 build a wall or a bridge 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.830
 I hope we all bridge 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.560

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.340
