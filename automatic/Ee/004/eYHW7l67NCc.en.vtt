and<00:00:24.330> that's<00:00:24.480> bad<00:00:24.689> enough<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.099> it's<00:00:26.099> actually

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and that's bad enough but it's actually

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.900 
and that's bad enough but it's actually
gotten<00:00:26.789> worse<00:00:26.869> now<00:00:27.869> Nestle<00:00:28.650> wants<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> patent

gotten worse now Nestle wants to patent

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.290 
gotten worse now Nestle wants to patent

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the fennel flower and its seeds they say

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
the fennel flower and its seeds they say
that<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.690> discovered<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.559> new

that they have discovered a new

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.420 
that they have discovered a new
medicinal<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.920> fennel<00:00:38.219> flower

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
medicinal use for the the fennel flower

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.869 
medicinal use for the the fennel flower
and<00:00:38.640> seeds<00:00:39.379> nigella<00:00:40.379> sativa<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.579> the

and seeds nigella sativa is is the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.010 
and seeds nigella sativa is is the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
flowers name and this active compound

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.200 
flowers name and this active compound
thymic<00:00:46.020> why<00:00:46.320> known<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:48.000> they're

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
thymic why known so what what they're

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
thymic why known so what what they're
saying<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:48.899> figured<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.590> by

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
saying is that they figured that by

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
saying is that they figured that by
McCoy<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.370> which<00:00:50.640> acts<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.090> opioid

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
McCoy know which acts on opioid

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.560 
McCoy know which acts on opioid
receptors<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.699> by<00:00:53.699> doing<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
receptors that by doing this it

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.650 
receptors that by doing this it
decreases<00:00:55.129> allergic<00:00:56.129> reactions<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> food<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
decreases allergic reactions to food and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
decreases allergic reactions to food and
that<00:00:58.199> by<00:00:58.350> doing<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:59.210> decreases<00:01:00.210> digestive

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that by doing that decreases digestive

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.100 
that by doing that decreases digestive
upsets<00:01:01.320> caused<00:01:01.620> by<00:01:01.949> allergic<00:01:02.550> reactions<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
upsets caused by allergic reactions so

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
upsets caused by allergic reactions so
they<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.799> saying<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.400> they're<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> first

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
they are saying that they're the first

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.539 
they are saying that they're the first
ones<00:01:06.299> who<00:01:06.570> figured<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.740> therefore

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
ones who figured this out and therefore

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
ones who figured this out and therefore
they<00:01:08.820> should<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> patent<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.439> only

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
they should have the patent on not only

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
they should have the patent on not only
artificial<00:01:11.400> thymic<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
artificial thymic we know and I just

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
artificial thymic we know and I just
made<00:01:13.020> from<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> flower<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> flower<00:01:14.189> and
