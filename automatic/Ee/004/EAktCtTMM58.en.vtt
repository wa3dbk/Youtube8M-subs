embarrassing<00:01:47.100> passages<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.909> indeed

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
embarrassing passages which do indeed

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
embarrassing passages which do indeed
prove<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> Bible<00:01:49.829> literally

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
prove that you take the Bible literally

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
prove that you take the Bible literally
then<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> must<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.939> false<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.079> actually

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
then it must be false but I actually

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.359 
then it must be false but I actually
want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.680> draw<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:52.829> attention<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.340> couple

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369

of<00:01:53.729> verses<00:01:53.880> which<00:01:54.479> haven't<00:01:54.810> gotten<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.140> much

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
of verses which haven't gotten as much

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.190 
of verses which haven't gotten as much
attention<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.920> think<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.219> deserved<00:01:57.200> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
attention as I think they deserved so

would<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:45.870> an<00:02:45.989> excellent<00:02:46.170> opportunity<00:02:46.470> for
