want to lay it on its side so let's

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
want to lay it on its side so let's
eject<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:50.570> they<00:00:51.570> call<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> multi<00:00:52.410> bay<00:00:53.390> you

eject this they call it a multi bay you
can<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:55.020> upgrades<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.860> by<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> way<00:00:56.219> but

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
can get upgrades for this by the way but

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.200 
can get upgrades for this by the way but
they're<00:00:57.239> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> expensive<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> mean<00:00:59.210> you

and this pops out set it aside then we

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.590 
and this pops out set it aside then we
take<00:01:23.530> off<00:01:23.800> this<00:01:24.400> cover<00:01:24.730> this<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.210> only<00:01:25.360> one

put<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.150> in<00:01:49.360> here<00:01:50.040> comes<00:01:51.040> off<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.460> top<00:01:51.700> and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
put this in here comes off the top and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.350 
put this in here comes off the top and
then<00:01:53.040> works<00:01:54.040> out<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.400> sides<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.910> memory

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
then works out the sides and the memory

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.840 
then works out the sides and the memory
is<00:02:01.600> underneath<00:02:02.050> here<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.840> hard<00:02:05.080> drive<00:02:05.850> they

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
is underneath here the hard drive they

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.450 
is underneath here the hard drive they
came<00:02:07.120> with<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.600> 10<00:02:08.020> gigabyte<00:02:08.500> hard<00:02:08.740> drive<00:02:08.860> I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
came with a 10 gigabyte hard drive I

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.670 
came with a 10 gigabyte hard drive I
replaced<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.270> with<00:02:10.330> an<00:02:10.510> 80<00:02:10.690> gigabyte<00:02:11.500> hard

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
replaced it with an 80 gigabyte hard

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.979 
replaced it with an 80 gigabyte hard
drive<00:02:14.820> all<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:16.330> need<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.630> do<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:18.989> take

okay here it is with the covers off you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.490 
okay here it is with the covers off you
can<00:02:46.180> see<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.630> memory<00:02:46.870> slot<00:02:47.760> right<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:49.500> see

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
can see the memory slot right here see

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.780 
can see the memory slot right here see
if<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.740> will<00:02:50.920> zoom<00:02:51.130> in

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:06.339 

it<00:02:56.790> came<00:02:57.120> with<00:02:59.569> 128<00:03:00.569> megabytes<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:02.810> PC<00:03:03.810> 100<00:03:04.500> and

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
it came with 128 megabytes of PC 100 and

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.770 
it came with 128 megabytes of PC 100 and
it's<00:03:07.349> upgradeable<00:03:08.040> only<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.730> 512<00:03:09.390> there's<00:03:09.719> a

it's upgradeable only to 512 there's a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.270 
it's upgradeable only to 512 there's a
limitation<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.680> BIOS<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:12.109> pegs<00:03:13.129> pigs<00:03:14.129> the

upper limit at 512 megabytes for that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.869 
upper limit at 512 megabytes for that
reason<00:03:21.200> I'd<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.560> careful<00:03:23.040> about<00:03:23.280> upgrading

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
reason I'd be careful about upgrading

the CPU if you want to upgrade the CPU

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.460 
the CPU if you want to upgrade the CPU
it's<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.290> socket<00:03:28.560> 317<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.549> take<00:03:29.790> these<00:03:30.470> screws

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
it's a socket 317 you take these screws

is<00:04:44.990> backwards<00:04:45.990> compatible<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:46.620> if<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.979> find<00:04:47.220> a

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
is backwards compatible so if you find a

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
deal with either of them a good price

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.010 
deal with either of them a good price
just<00:04:49.949> go<00:04:50.099> with<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.419> same<00:04:51.419> thing<00:04:51.599> with<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.780> hard

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.839 
just go with that same thing with a hard
drive<00:04:53.180> it's<00:04:54.180> 88<00:04:55.940> 100<00:04:57.199> but<00:04:58.199> if<00:04:58.949> you<00:04:59.159> find<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.610> deal

drive it's 88 100 but if you find a deal
like<00:05:00.120> this<00:05:00.330> one<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.810> believe<00:05:01.229> is<00:05:01.620> 88<00:05:02.070> 133<00:05:02.789> that's
