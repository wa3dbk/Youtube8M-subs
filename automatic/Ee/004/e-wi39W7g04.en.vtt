00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to use a flux head ratchet it's nicer to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
to use a flux head ratchet it's nicer to
use<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.579> me<00:00:35.700> as<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.239> mechanic<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.719> use<00:00:36.899> them<00:00:37.079> all

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
use for me as a mechanic I use them all

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
better long extension is going to be

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
better long extension is going to be
nice<00:00:42.480> 10<00:00:43.320> millimeter<00:00:43.710> socket<00:00:43.800> you're<00:00:44.280> going

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
nice 10 millimeter socket you're going

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.279

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you have to take off the air intake

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
you have to take off the air intake
Inlet<00:01:24.299> there's<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.409> Phillips<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.369> is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Inlet there's two Phillips all you do is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
Inlet there's two Phillips all you do is
just<00:01:26.700> break<00:01:26.850> them<00:01:27.030> loose<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.140> once<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.470> do

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
just break them loose and once you do

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
just break them loose and once you do
the<00:01:28.770> top<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:29.130> pop<00:01:29.310> off<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> them<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.909> they'll

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the top will pop off of them and they'll

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.399 
the top will pop off of them and they'll
come<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.689> next<00:01:33.960> step<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
come right out the next step is going to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.590 
come right out the next step is going to
be<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.710> taking<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.280> lifting<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.329> over

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
be just taking this lifting it up over

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
be just taking this lifting it up over
here<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.439> pulling<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.280> make

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
here and then pulling it out you make

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
here and then pulling it out you make
your<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.729> popping<00:01:39.210> sound<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.600> it's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
your a little popping sound but it's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
your a little popping sound but it's
okay<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.530> has<00:01:40.710> some<00:01:40.890> locks<00:01:41.130> on

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
okay because it just has some locks on

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.719

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
don't drop it into the fender where I'll

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.449 
don't drop it into the fender where I'll
you'll<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.439> tasting<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.190> while

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
you'll be tasting it for a little while

you'll be tasting it for a little while
just<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:13.519> also<00:02:15.170> you're<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.319> want

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
just like that also you're going to want

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.410 
just like that also you're going to want
to<00:02:16.560> take<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.830> flat-head<00:02:17.040> screwdriver<00:02:17.420> loosen

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
to take the flat-head screwdriver loosen

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.270 
to take the flat-head screwdriver loosen
your<00:02:18.690> two<00:02:18.870> clamps<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.380> your<00:02:19.500> air<00:02:19.620> intake<00:02:19.800> inlet

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
your two clamps on your air intake inlet

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.729 
your two clamps on your air intake inlet
and<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.790> will<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.060> slide<00:02:21.420> off<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.280> so

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
and it will just slide off just like so

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.840 
and it will just slide off just like so
the<00:02:25.739> next<00:02:25.950> step<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.220> going<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.459> unplugging

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
the next step is going to be unplugging

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.520 
the next step is going to be unplugging
the<00:02:27.060> mass<00:02:27.209> airflow<00:02:27.420> sensor<00:02:27.630> it's<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.350> push

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
the mass airflow sensor it's just a push

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
the mass airflow sensor it's just a push
clip<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.519> you're<00:02:29.640> gonna<00:02:29.760> push<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.120> pull<00:02:30.959> it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
clip so you're gonna push it pull it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.570 
clip so you're gonna push it pull it
good<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.250> go

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
good to go

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.400

there's one little bracket that holds

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.050 
there's one little bracket that holds
this<00:02:34.500> down<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.920> here<00:02:34.950> go<00:02:35.430> wire<00:02:35.610> harness<00:02:35.970> so

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
this down in here go wire harness so

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.449 
this down in here go wire harness so
you're<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.330> want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.480> undo<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:37.459> also

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459
