00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
bit about these systems you know to be

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.569 
bit about these systems you know to be
honest<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.890> reason<00:00:19.919> there's<00:00:20.460> so

honest with you the reason there's so

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.720 
honest with you the reason there's so
many<00:00:20.730> systems<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.720> because<00:00:22.470> dog<00:00:22.829> trainers<00:00:23.399> you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
many systems is because dog trainers you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.979 
many systems is because dog trainers you
know<00:00:23.820> they're<00:00:24.029> out<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.630> competitive

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
know they're out there in a competitive

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.019 
know they're out there in a competitive
marketplace<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.489> have<00:00:26.669> to<00:00:26.790> try<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
marketplace and they have to try to

right and so you know I've got my own
little<00:00:43.050> pitch<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:44.790> know<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.060> three

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
little pitch and you know I know three

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.550 
little pitch and you know I know three
or<00:00:45.450> four<00:00:45.630> of<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.810> guys<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.260> good<00:00:46.380> dog

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
or four of the guys that are good dog

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.290 
or four of the guys that are good dog
trainers<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.100> got<00:00:47.280> their<00:00:47.490> pitch<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.150> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
trainers they got their pitch but the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.780 
trainers they got their pitch but the
reality<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.170> there's<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.490> in<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
reality is there's not really much in a

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.030 
reality is there's not really much in a
way<00:00:50.970> of<00:00:51.300> variance<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.930> systems<00:00:52.470> exactly

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
way of variance in systems exactly

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.460 
way of variance in systems exactly
because<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.579> systems<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.420> made<00:00:54.900> up<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
because all systems are made up of the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.970 
because all systems are made up of the
same<00:00:56.190> five<00:00:56.840> fundamental<00:00:57.840> aspects

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
same five fundamental aspects

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.160 
same five fundamental aspects
okay<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.610> socialization<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.900> got

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
okay you got socialization you got

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.210 
okay you got socialization you got
motivation

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
motivation

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.850 
motivation
you<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.690> communication<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.379> physical

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you got communication you have physical

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830 
you got communication you have physical
management<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.240> realistic

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
management and you have realistic

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.740 
management and you have realistic
expectations<00:01:07.670> okay<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.000> let's<00:01:09.210> break<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
expectations okay so let's break that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.630 
expectations okay so let's break that
down<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.070> let's<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.610> through

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
down right now and let's go through

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.149 
down right now and let's go through
those<00:01:12.150> five<00:01:12.479> things<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.229> underpin<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.800> dog

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
those five things that underpin all dog

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
those five things that underpin all dog
training<00:01:14.490> systems<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.120> then<00:01:15.510> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.810> what

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
training systems and then I think what

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.750 
training systems and then I think what
you'll<00:01:16.140> start<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.500> understand<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.370> that<00:01:17.400> these

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
you'll start to understand is that these

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.360 
you'll start to understand is that these
these<00:01:18.180> different<00:01:18.870> ways<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.380> approaching<00:01:19.710> dog

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
these different ways of approaching dog

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.789 
these different ways of approaching dog
training<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.440> they<00:01:22.590> are

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
training you know really what they are

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.160 
training you know really what they are
just<00:01:23.190> some<00:01:23.610> people<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.479> put<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:24.960> bit

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
just some people that put a little bit

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.550 
just some people that put a little bit
of<00:01:25.290> emphasis<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.510> one<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.870> those<00:01:28.290> or

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
of emphasis on you know one of those or

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
of emphasis on you know one of those or
two<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.920> those<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.340> three<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.670> those<00:01:29.790> five<00:01:30.120> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
two of those are three of those five you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
two of those are three of those five you
know<00:01:30.690> fundamental<00:01:31.320> things<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.010> everybody

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
know fundamental things but everybody

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.359 
know fundamental things but everybody
has<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> address<00:01:33.510> them<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.770> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
has to address them you know and so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
has to address them you know and so
don't<00:01:35.580> get<00:01:35.820> caught<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.570> these<00:01:36.720> arguments

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
don't get caught up in these arguments

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.680 
don't get caught up in these arguments
go<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.159> watch<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.210> understand

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
go out and watch and see and understand

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.840 
go out and watch and see and understand
the<00:01:39.810> dog<00:01:40.049> trainers<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.010> know<00:01:41.159> they<00:01:41.580> need<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the dog trainers you know they need a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.250 
the dog trainers you know they need a
little<00:01:42.090> leeway<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.840> need<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> little

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
little leeway they need a little

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.140 
little leeway they need a little
understanding<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.760> you<00:01:44.880> watch

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
understanding when you go and you watch
