00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.310
 in this whole city of geeks and there's no 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.890
 nobody now this is seriously it seems like 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.990
 If what happened here was not real is 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.000
 like everything I do and I say out 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.130
 done by a pendeja who does not know what 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.660
 more to do with your life going up 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.760
 Youtube 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.720
 but well I think I'm just 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.120
 hallucinating you should not eat so much chocolate 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.790
 I'm so bored in this fucking city 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.830
 geek does not happen anything interesting in 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.720
 moments like this I would like to have 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.350
 someone who is always with me and never 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.760
 I abandoned 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.600
 poor thing, stop playing a song 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.829
 sad for you in the little world 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.329

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.260

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.870
 a kitten 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.500
 would stay home in bars to give him 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.500
 eat animals 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.100

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.560

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.239
 a fixed place to go to since my 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.190
 parents died when I was very young and 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.560

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.379

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.180

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.209
