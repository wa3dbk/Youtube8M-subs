00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello girls here is the new video 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.410
 in this video I'll show you one 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 french marble effect decorated with 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.960
 first molds I prepare long e 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.030
 with a after having prepared it with a gel 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.390
 cover I'm going to cover only mine 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.420
 nail bed does not extend it there 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.660
 I put a bit of gel on the enamel cover 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.300
 cover small imperfections and leave the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.330
 my nail completely free then what 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.130
 I take a green metallic gel 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 and I put it in spots as you are seeing 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.780
 from the video there must not be an order 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.149
 precise with which bo you place yourself 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.910
 this colored gel has to go a little 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.829
 feeling like you prefer I 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.329
 put more green because I wanted it to be 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.610
 the dominant color within 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 this decoration then I take the gel 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 white and with white gel goes by 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.789
 fill all the empty spaces or almost 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.309
 all the empty spaces that have remained 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.500
 discovered by the other colored gel then 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 and go to arrange it then I take a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 thin tip brush as you see 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.020
 goes from mixing the two colors 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.580
 I don't mix them too much pre 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.060
 I want it to be a marble effect 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.490
 really very delicate but I try to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.700
 pull the green over the white e 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 vice versa just to create this 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.220
 mixture of two colors that one is going to do 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.570
 the marble effect then I take 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.299
 of white acrylic gel is a spot e 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.460
 I make this little crown around mine 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.979
 french which also serves to delineate it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 with the molds I make this flower then 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.299
 with a gel base attack a micro 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 glitter over the flower to decorate it a 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.450
 I apply the sealed glossy final e 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.820
 the cuticle oil as you see this is the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 final result is a french that from a 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.619
 side for me is quite simple but that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.299
 at the same time enough 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.130
 particular because it has a marble effect 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.950
 it is not an effect and that you see all the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.600
 days and on girls' nails 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 I think it can also be done with 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.979
 I have not yet approved glazes then 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.689
 if you want to leave a video of response 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.740
 in which he wants made with enamels 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.660
 show also 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.180
 the girls how it's done I'll be glad to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.830
 publish it I hope you like a lot 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.720
 this nail art and I send you a kiss 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.720
