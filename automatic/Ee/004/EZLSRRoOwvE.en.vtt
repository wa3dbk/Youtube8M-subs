00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 a month later a little more just on vacation 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
 Look at the happiness that is over 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.750
 So it started an old I went back to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
 work at the camping, all right then 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.130
 we are home to see what was happening 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.810
 last month besides the written hymn and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 everything is going very well very well 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.539
 incredibly well he 's amazing he was 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.800
 pretty 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.820
 the following I read Volume 5 and the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.410
 volume 6 which is written continues equal 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.750
 still continue with many incredible 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.500
 literature references and found this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.629
 cover looks the cover that this letter but 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.180
 XandÃ£o missile something happened and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.910
 It's just a way for me, man. 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.620
 so I know it's still good 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.300
 Anyway, I do not know, I have control over 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.980
 discover what was true even when 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.590
 is not not know what they readied 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.010
 but gave a taste of end of series 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 so I am sometimes satisfied as 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.239
 the last book is over I do not have 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.369
 I want to get back the rest I need 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.060
 do all a mental work now for 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.110
 Read the rest I know I can do is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 the reality 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.100
 the madness have that level but there 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.549
 That's it, and I finally got it. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 The subject souls paint for all of us is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.840
 thanks, staff for encouraging the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 The truth has not happened but I 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 I understand why I could not read 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.840
 when I went on page 150 it worked 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.840
 I thought the story was kind of off 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.909
 of tuning like that and did not seem to seal 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.700
 then the panel 151 the knowledge 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.979
 specific and ailton the brother now 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470
 It's coming out and that's it. Let's finish this. 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.979
 month I hope to finish soon 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.810
 That said it was on my list of ten 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.960
 years was 15 to get two books 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.270
 list and one of his books will be the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 right apprentice is that learning is 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.799
 joseph delaney I could read the book 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.689
 It's all incredible, I got to read the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.509
 second that also an issue and also 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.920
 to be what is the secret he 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.590
 three books first three books 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.780
 series and watch the movie because I said 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.360
 I do not know if you want to know what 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 I think the movie there on the blog leaves the link 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.450
 underneath I say I found the movie 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.840
 repeat that pain in the soul life but everything 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.580
 good 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.530
 The book is incredible that what matters is 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.410
 funny because the book so it is 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.480
 about a 13-year-old child who 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.060
 seventh child of a site a child in that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.770
 medieval world they live is the father's 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.959
 employment for all children and how to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.140
 He is the seventh son of the lead, right? 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.760
 litter he the father of all open 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.470
 favors he could not get it 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.870
 Can not get the job for the tone is the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.850
 his son and his mother already had 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.010
 that this plan leaves him like hunting done 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.590
 This alone learns if and there begins to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.070
 Her story does not even have a narrative of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.040
 suspense that 's really scary is 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.600
 in the first book has a 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.060
 proves that he makes the bread spend one night 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.090
 in a haunted house is the gnaws 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.300
 nails and listen back do not read night is 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.380
 of course the son at night and competing 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.150
 I already said it here but I do not read 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.890
 books are afraid of the truth then 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.750
 I avoid then I think it 's officially 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.480
 This is a book with the protagonist. 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.370
 the child is so dark this way so 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.470
 It's one thing the villains of this book you 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.600
 they have no idea they are really villains 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.750
 and sound to witches are really witches 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.560
 mass so once correa black beard 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.709
 so it 's disgusting, huh? 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.660
 lion has a lot of faith is not amazing I think 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.549
 that for those who like the magic of 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 fantasy has to read because it has to 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.540
 be in our repertoire in the catalog of 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.760
 read books have to install the apprentice 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.720
 at least until the three books 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.519
 from cef 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.829
 after that without wanting to join me 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.739
 had already here the time was of an author 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.630
 as incredible as amazing as how 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.269
 chris liddell is the team's profile chris 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 liddell psi dell is one of the illustrators 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.590
 of no game as the world is round in the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.000
 even and I went to have a look he is the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.019
 author a great author of children's books 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.600
 and a very cool thing is that the actions 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:10.120
 it's just a crying thing 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.650
 the book it's all black green and white 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.590
 the other results are also like this 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.530
 so black and white and an adjacent crown 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.080
 Finally, Torino is a children's book like 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.270
 I said a children's classic actually 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.270
 is rendered antonin with my search 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.669
 ozzy and even the best friend who 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.039
 is Mr. Monroe who is that mini cousin 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.300
 it quinlan celebrates the ego of a ticket 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.220
 she goes after him 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.289
 the story is basically race but they 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.780
 Curious, the book has one thing one 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.060
 little is not new to be active but 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.449
 it has some elements that resemble or 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.159
 Try not to know each other said 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.110
 x120e serious with these children half 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.400
 strangers who are super smart and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.280
 such for this it bears no resemblance 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.720
 finally have in the block leave the link underneath 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.460
 you can see other internal photos of the 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.960
 book very real shine to level 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.849
 who likes illustration must give a 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.650
 at least one veneered on it then 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.210
 take one of them there some photos from the blog 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.250
 that the test is a bit better and 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.280
 Last, he is the second book on the list of 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.050
 10 2015 It was funny to read a matilda 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.699
 book after adult in it 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.979
 also a book he saw was a 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.630
 first with family and me 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.159
 the film passing on the head so a 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.810
 A little more I could actually 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.669
 burst one thing or another I found the 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.949
 film very faithful to the book and I do not know 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.900
 because when I read I was seeing the 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.669
 movie in my head i liked it so much 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.680
 How amazing the movie was? 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.449
 reason he now wants to read the others 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.880
 doubt that other analysts were laymen 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.250
 they are touching these things 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.229
 for today this is what I wanted a male and 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.380
 April I have big plans to open I 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.479
 I want to read same day woman 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.240
 I want to read things is a 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:46.759
 problem this life of wanting even as 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.759
 I would say dori continue to give
