segment we're gonna learn all about how
to<00:00:04.920> grow<00:00:05.220> grow<00:00:05.819> Walia<00:00:06.390> it's<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.170> beautiful

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
to grow grow Walia it's a beautiful

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.970 
to grow grow Walia it's a beautiful
plant<00:00:08.069> from<00:00:08.370> south<00:00:08.639> america<00:00:09.200> now<00:00:10.200> bro<00:00:10.500> Walia

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
plant from south america now bro Walia

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.900 
plant from south america now bro Walia
or<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.420> bush<00:00:12.630> violet<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.519> native<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
or the bush violet is native to the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.050 
or the bush violet is native to the
tropical<00:00:15.269> parts<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.379> South<00:00:16.680> America<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
tropical parts of South America so the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.090 
tropical parts of South America so the
southern<00:00:18.270> part<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> South<00:00:19.020> America<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.740> pretty

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
southern part of South America is pretty

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.730 
southern part of South America is pretty
cold<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.820> they<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.210> grow<00:00:21.449> very<00:00:21.720> well<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
cold so they don't grow very well to the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.679 
cold so they don't grow very well to the
southern<00:00:23.070> part<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> continent<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.570> in

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
southern part of the continent but in

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.720 
southern part of the continent but in
the<00:00:24.810> warm<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.380> warmer<00:00:25.769> areas<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.400> really

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the warm the warmer areas they do really

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.689 
the warm the warmer areas they do really
well<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.689> there's<00:00:27.900> six<00:00:28.320> different<00:00:28.590> species<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
well so there's six different species of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
well so there's six different species of
these<00:00:29.970> bushy<00:00:30.300> annuals<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.170> have

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
these bushy annuals and they have

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.010 
these bushy annuals and they have
evergreen<00:00:31.800> perennials<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.550> well<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.120> they

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
evergreen perennials as well and they

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.350 
evergreen perennials as well and they
are<00:00:34.050> densely<00:00:34.620> foliage<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> compact<00:00:35.880> habit

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.350 
soft stems and simple strongly veined
deep<00:00:39.239> green<00:00:39.600> leaves<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.680> flowers<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.760> really

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
deep green leaves the flowers are really

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.619 
deep green leaves the flowers are really
bright<00:00:43.100> blue<00:00:44.100> purple<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.700> white<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.329> they're

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
bright blue purple and white and they're

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.770 
bright blue purple and white and they're
actually<00:00:45.989> related<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.440> nicotiana<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.780> that's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
actually related to nicotiana and that's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
actually related to nicotiana and that's
always<00:00:49.079> amazes<00:00:49.770> me<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> nice

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
always amazes me so they have a nice

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
always amazes me so they have a nice
fragrance<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.390> well<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.649> different

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
fragrance as well so there are different

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490 
fragrance as well so there are different
types<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.699> Bro<00:00:53.910> Walia<00:00:54.300> there's<00:00:54.600> annuals<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
types of Bro Walia there's annuals and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
types of Bro Walia there's annuals and
then<00:00:55.739> there's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> perennial<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> annual

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
then there's a perennial so the annual

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.770 
then there's a perennial so the annual
variety<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.410> called<00:00:58.920> bro<00:00:59.190> Walia<00:00:59.780> americana

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
variety is called bro Walia americana

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.280 
variety is called bro Walia americana
and<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.980> makes<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.430> bushy<00:01:02.640> plant<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.660> 24

inches tall in the summer through the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
inches tall in the summer through the
early<00:01:06.600> autumn<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.170> bears<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:08.070> beautiful

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700 
makes a good garden plant or a basket
plant<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:18.000> grows<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.840> well<00:01:18.990> outdoors

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
plant and it grows really well outdoors

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
plant and it grows really well outdoors
and<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.340> two<00:01:20.640> different<00:01:20.850> varieties

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and there's two different varieties

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.450 
and there's two different varieties
there's<00:01:21.750> Vanya<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.439> has<00:01:22.590> deep<00:01:23.250> blue

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460

flowers with white eyes and white bells

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.370 
flowers with white eyes and white bells
so<00:01:26.369> they're<00:01:26.549> only<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:26.970> from<00:01:27.240> zones<00:01:27.659> nine<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so they're only good from zones nine to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
so they're only good from zones nine to
eleven<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> reseed<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.659> every

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
eleven so you have to reseed them every

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.569 
eleven so you have to reseed them every
year<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.350> live<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> colder<00:01:32.130> climate<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
year if you live in a colder climate and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
year if you live in a colder climate and
even<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.210> live<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> warmer<00:01:33.780> climate<00:01:33.810> on

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
even if you live in a warmer climate on

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.039 
even if you live in a warmer climate on
the<00:01:35.180> Americana<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.420> need<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> start<00:01:36.930> them

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the Americana you need to start them

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
the Americana you need to start them
every<00:01:37.290> year<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> seed<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.670> there's<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
every year as a seed but then there's a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
every year as a seed but then there's a
speciosa<00:01:39.840> which<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> bro<00:01:40.619> Walia<00:01:41.040> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
speciosa which is a bro Walia which is a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.530 
speciosa which is a bro Walia which is a
perennial<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:43.320> gets<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> 30<00:01:45.329> inches

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
perennial and it gets up to 30 inches

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.219 
perennial and it gets up to 30 inches
tall<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.820> comes<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.630> purples<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
tall and it is comes in purples and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.560 
tall and it is comes in purples and
whites<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.890> all<00:01:50.430> different<00:01:50.670> colors<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.420> it's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
whites in all different colors but it's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.139 
whites in all different colors but it's
only<00:01:51.720> zone<00:01:52.020> 9<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> 11<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.430> you'd<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.939> bring

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
only zone 9 to 11 so you'd have to bring

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
only zone 9 to 11 so you'd have to bring
it<00:01:54.240> inside<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> winter<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.799> rooted

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
