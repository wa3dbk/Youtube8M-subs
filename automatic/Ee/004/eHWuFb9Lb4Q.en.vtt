00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so different in the technique that I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.710 
so different in the technique that I
thought<00:00:19.529> I'd<00:00:19.680> post<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.130> anyway<00:00:20.460> how<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.359> teach

feet touch the book this is the fastest

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.780 
feet touch the book this is the fastest
way<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> next<00:00:40.020> step<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.410> getting<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.070> dog<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

they're between your legs you can also

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
they're between your legs you can also
use<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> mat<00:00:46.079> instead<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> book<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.579> just

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
use a mat instead of a book don't just

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
use a mat instead of a book don't just
say<00:00:48.090> yes<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.570> click<00:00:48.809> once<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.289> want<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590

maintaining both feet on the target the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
maintaining both feet on the target the
next<00:00:54.930> step<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> positioning<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.039> feet

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
next step is positioning your feet

closer<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.030> closer<00:00:57.239> together<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
closer and closer together so that the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
closer and closer together so that the
dog<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:58.890> become<00:00:59.219> likely<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.300> put

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
exactly what you would hope for now you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
exactly what you would hope for now you
can<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.000> I've<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.420> feet<00:01:15.630> closer<00:01:15.930> together

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
can see I've got my feet closer together

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710 
can see I've got my feet closer together
and<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> way<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.909> hold<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> treat

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and it's the way that I hold the treat

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.380 
and it's the way that I hold the treat
how<00:01:19.380> far<00:01:19.680> away<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.310> treat<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.119> feet

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
how far away the treat is from my feet

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
how far away the treat is from my feet
and<00:01:21.659> by<00:01:22.080> moving<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.560> treat<00:01:22.770> left<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> right

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and by moving the treat left and right

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
and by moving the treat left and right
is<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.600> causing<00:01:24.780> him<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.229> move<00:01:25.409> his<00:01:25.530> feet

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is actually causing him to move his feet

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490 
is actually causing him to move his feet
on<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.100> my<00:01:26.250> feet<00:01:26.630> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.810> find<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.350> dog
