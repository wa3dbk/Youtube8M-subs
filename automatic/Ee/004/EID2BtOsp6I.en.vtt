00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.330
 here near vale we are in east village 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.700
 and here is the character that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.860

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.730
 some evildoers down the alleys but 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.580
 we have separated and now I do not know where 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.720
 attitudes 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.910
 and bring it to a black panther is worth the 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.630
 we have here close 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.630

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.570
 now yes here we have attend but 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.170
 first we have to destroy all 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.670
 these 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.810
 enemies that we have here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.730
 so everyone who goes to us 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.100
 appearing then we destroy them 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.820
 ok right now we are with iron 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.470

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.160
 what else 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.830
 what else do we have here where we 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.830
 take ti d'elx 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.980
 and here we have more enemies 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.300
 so we're going to destroy them all 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.300
 as fast as we can 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.540
 It's great for us to get closer 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.540
 but they will not be able to do it with us 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 anda hotels 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.149

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.500
 let's see it we go to the top of 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.170
 these buildings that we have here for 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.000
 here is not worth we have to follow the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.000
 little blue arrow we have here 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.100

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.100
 and that we destroy all 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.760
 all our enemies here we have one 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:48.290

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.190

 and we have to make him follow us 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.470
 as far as this black panther is worth 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.210
