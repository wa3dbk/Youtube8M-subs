00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.870
 if the situation is not the best for the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 nintendo is natural that she post in her 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.480
 main franchises to leverage 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.269
 river sales and after Mario arrived at 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 time of the iconic primates appear 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.050
 console in donkey kong country shop 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.910
 safes 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 a retro studios repeats the formula 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.030
 presented in wii and 3ds games but 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 with some news 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.070
 the main one is the much bigger cast 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.399
 than in the previous adventure 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 now beyond di Conte the great gorilla 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.100
 You can count on the help of dick and click. 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.489
 with two well-known characters from the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 fans and returning in this new generation 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.920
 only that this is not just a 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.719
 nostalgic feeling each of these 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 four vants has an ability 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.760
 single that will help you different 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.979
 ways throughout the phases 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.920
 diddy and dixie kong's lend a helping hand 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.320
 with larger heels while the old 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.659
 Frank uses his walking stick to jump with 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.180
 security by some obstacles 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.130
 this variety is fundamental 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.530
 especially for those who want to explore 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.530
 each of the phases in their entirety 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.390
 the new dock with where it has a design 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.420
 very careful that it values ​​the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.030
 precision and reflexes of the players 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.340
 so you will have to use and abuse the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.530
 characteristics of each character to 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.850
 find all the treasures and items 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.520
 hidden 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.590
 and since we are talking about the phases not 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.630
 we can not cite how much they 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.909
 they are beautiful 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.810
 besides the artistic character they still 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.490
 impressed by the challenge proposed 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.250
 everything is carefully positioned 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.179
 to test the skills of those who are 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.159
 in control 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.289
 whether it is time to deflect an attack 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.840
 came out of nowhere or not to fall into a 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.720
 hole that just came out like this 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.120
 any second of hesitation can 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.420
 turn into death shop that i did is 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.390
 a game based on trial and error 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.489
 only at the same time that this 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.410
 high difficulty makes the game 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.110
 be a great request for those who are 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.690
 tired of the softness of her current games 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.090
 is also responsible for some slips 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.700
 and we're not talking about just the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.980
 frustration accompanying the failure but 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.640
 the very lack of variety in these 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.130
 obstacles still lack variety in the hour 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.769
 to present the most 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.989
 that they are all of them 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.410
 the same logic of jumping in the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.959
 time and follow a specific rhythm 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.549
 This is really cool at first, but it's tiring. 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.750
 When you realize that it will not go far 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:04.120
 moreover it is for this kind of thing that 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.120
 the most different phases are the most 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.519
 our attention to explore a mine 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.620
 abandoned in a small wagon or 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.720
 playing in a sawmill are some of the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.329
 few moments of shopping safes in 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.370
 we think outside the box and that's what 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.370
 makes the game a lot more fun 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.240
 battles against bosses are another 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.940
 show apart 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.160
 besides being very different from one another 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.400
 standard of each of them will require 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.650
 fast thinking and lots of skill 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.280
 it is no wonder that facing these enemies 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.770
 is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.890
 Only we can not talk about donkey kong. 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.320
 cars without commenting on their art stages 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.180
 are beautiful and each one of them will lead 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.960
 You for a stroll in scenarios 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.450
 beautiful add a soundtrack 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:05.860
 inspired and we have one of the most 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:07.900
 beautiful that they have been through the river then 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.790
 that with the car and tropical flowers can 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.980
 not be the great launch that goes 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.440
 turn the tide in favor of Nintendo but 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.510
 will certainly liven up the owners of the river 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.540
 for a long time 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.390
 with an incredible creative faces and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.820
 a cavalry dose of challenge to the new 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.650
 adventure of the primates have their charm and 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.890
 will learn your attention by a good 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.560
 time and however much the game may 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.930
 make it very repetitive over time 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.540
 is not such a big problem to 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.360
 point of shine at the end of the 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.910
 donkey and diddy accounts and the whole family 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.790
 with a show that is still in great 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.830
 and even though the river is not 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.780
 so good of the legs 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.810
 console owners do not have to 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.090
 complain when it comes to quality 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.920
 be sure to check the text of the 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.730
 analysis in a DJ and until our next 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.730
 video
