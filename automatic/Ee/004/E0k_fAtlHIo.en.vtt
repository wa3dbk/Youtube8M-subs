00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 what 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.349
 Y 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.220
 there is a department the clinic that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.780
 call department of orthopedics 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.020
 Visual habilitation is a term 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.660
 that is already being implemented for all 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.240
 those people who present some 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.460
 type of alteration in the muscles of 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.129
 the eyes or visual alterations and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.420
 then the therapies are on track 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.790
 that if the patient has some kind of 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.190
 strabismus that is a strabismus that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.910
 can correct with these therapies 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.460
 what we do is again align your 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.130
 musculature let's say so align your 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.910
 eyes to make the eyes are not 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.220
 diverted and sometimes what we do 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.720
 It is also to reinforce all this motility 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.550
 eye for patients presenting 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.320
 insufficiency of convergence 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.479
 inadequacy accommodation that are 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.030
 people who tire very fatigue 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.190
 sleep when reading heavy eyes 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.440
 then those people who suddenly 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.479
 they are working with the entire computer 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.220
 the day they present many of these 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.830
 symptomatology then in the therapies 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.289
 what they do is reinforce that part 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.850
 muscular so that in their work they can 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.250
 receive in a better way 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.990
 and in the part of visual rehabilitation 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.850
 is oriented to patients who 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.220
 present amblyopia more than all are 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.330
 children because the visual acuity is 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.759
 It can work approximately 12 maximum 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.759
 14 years old then the idea is is 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.210
 work that lazy eye they call and 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.460
 turn it active again and level what 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.100
 with your eye that has better vision 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.649
 then therapies are already done 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.590
 aimed at that restructuring 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.080
 visual to work all that part that the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.450
 child suddenly had a premium 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.729
 visual and therefore his vision 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.170
 was reducing to the maximum then in the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.020
 therapy what we do is go back 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.690
 again as to raise that sharpness 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.670
 visual and that reaches values within 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.400
 normal for us for their 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.790
 visual development simply comes to the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.299
 week between two and three times a week 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.720
 they are therapies of 20 minutes to half an hour 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.640
 the broad patient who will work with 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.430
 some special filters that are the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.390
 lenses that we are going to put 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.700
 in front of his little boy 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.720
 and we place it doing vision tasks 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.290
 close as these are to color press 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.350
 cut out yes for him to stimulate with that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.150
 red filter your visual acuity after 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.150
 the therapy we are evaluating 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.330
 to watch the patient's follow-up and 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.540
 At home we leave some support exercises 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.459
 the patient when his cycle of 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.400
 therapies we sometimes do cycles 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.470
 as of 10 sessions and when it ends them 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.360
 we do periodic checks for 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.000
 look if the treatment has been maintained 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.640
 what is it would be ideal if you have 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.050
 maintained and if his visual acuity and his 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.050
 strabismus are controlled
