thing that we're gonna talk about in

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
thing that we're gonna talk about in
this<00:00:30.689> video<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.199> offer<00:00:31.619> up<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.520> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
this video and offer up and see what you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.200 
this video and offer up and see what you
guys<00:00:32.730> think

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
guys think

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
guys think
so<00:00:33.420> obviously<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> simplest<00:00:34.980> easiest<00:00:35.219> way<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so obviously the simplest easiest way to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.119 
so obviously the simplest easiest way to
start<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.090> fire<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.780> cigarette<00:00:36.989> lighter<00:00:37.320> so

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
start a fire is a cigarette lighter so

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.880 
start a fire is a cigarette lighter so
there<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.500> they<00:00:40.500> didn't<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.770> big

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
there you go they didn't have big

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.229 
there you go they didn't have big
lighters<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.940> found<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
lighters and all that but I found a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.220 
lighters and all that but I found a
three<00:00:42.510> pack<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.140> generic<00:00:43.469> v<00:00:44.250> lights<00:00:45.230> for

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
three pack of your generic v lights for

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440 
three pack of your generic v lights for
the<00:00:46.320> three<00:00:46.800> four<00:00:46.980> bucks<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.550> went<00:00:48.210> ahead<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the three four bucks so went ahead and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
the three four bucks so went ahead and
got<00:00:48.539> those<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.559> opened<00:00:49.770> them<00:00:49.980> yet<00:00:50.039> let

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
got those have not opened them yet let

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.369 
got those have not opened them yet let
me<00:00:50.340> go<00:00:50.489> ahead<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> now

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
me go ahead and do that now

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.799 
me go ahead and do that now
to<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.739> things<00:00:53.010> actually<00:00:53.780> strike<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
to see if these things actually strike a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
to see if these things actually strike a
light<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.230> anything<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:56.010> are

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
light or anything like that they are

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.450 
light or anything like that they are
adjustable<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.260> flame<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.100> seems

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
adjustable on the flame so that seems

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
adjustable on the flame so that seems
pretty<00:00:59.730> decent<00:01:00.350> next<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:03.379> also<00:01:04.379> fairly

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
pretty decent next one also fairly

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.010 
pretty decent next one also fairly
decent<00:01:06.260> third<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.790> also<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.689> check<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
decent third one also good to check the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.580 
decent third one also good to check the
adjustability<00:01:11.180> perfectly<00:01:12.180> decent<00:01:12.360> there<00:01:12.780> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
adjustability perfectly decent there so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
adjustability perfectly decent there so
these<00:01:13.740> three<00:01:13.979> seem<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> work<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> don't

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
these three seem to work now I don't

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.820 
these three seem to work now I don't
know<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.900> want<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> pass<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.470> three<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
know if we want to pass all three of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.080 
know if we want to pass all three of
these<00:01:16.920> guys<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:17.700> part<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
these guys so that's part of the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.460 
these guys so that's part of the
equation<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.780> how<00:01:18.900> many<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> carry

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
equation you know how many do you carry

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.460 
equation you know how many do you carry
I<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:20.220> probably<00:01:20.400> say<00:01:20.640> two<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> beyond<00:01:22.259> this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I would probably say two and beyond this

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.060 
I would probably say two and beyond this
getting<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> basic<00:01:23.759> smashes<00:01:24.560> dinah<00:01:25.560> matches

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
getting a basic smashes dinah matches

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.190 
getting a basic smashes dinah matches
the<00:01:26.820> strike<00:01:27.090> anywhere<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.750> box<00:01:28.350> type<00:01:28.680> stuff

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
32 count per little pack and there are

32 count per little pack and there are
10<00:01:33.900> packs<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.630> what<00:01:36.630> does<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.900> 320

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
10 packs here so what does that 320

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
10 packs here so what does that 320
matches<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.700> smaller<00:01:39.000> ones<00:01:39.299> though<00:01:39.479> now

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.920 
type thing so there's that option and
only<00:03:40.739> somewhat<00:03:41.040> less<00:03:41.280> cost<00:03:42.180> efficient<00:03:42.720> but

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
only somewhat less cost efficient but

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.030 
only somewhat less cost efficient but
size<00:03:43.199> efficient<00:03:43.790> three<00:03:44.790> small<00:03:45.859> bottles<00:03:46.859> of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
size efficient three small bottles of

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.710 
size efficient three small bottles of
hand<00:03:47.190> sanitizer<00:03:47.340> each<00:03:47.940> one<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.239> them<00:03:48.359> is<00:03:48.510> two

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
hand sanitizer each one of them is two

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.259 
hand sanitizer each one of them is two
fluid<00:03:49.079> ounces<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.949> that's<00:03:50.160> six<00:03:50.489> ounces<00:03:50.910> for<00:03:51.239> a

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
fluid ounces so that's six ounces for a

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.050 
fluid ounces so that's six ounces for a
buck<00:03:51.540> versus<00:03:52.199> 10<00:03:52.829> ounces<00:03:53.190> for<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> bucks<00:03:53.819> and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
buck versus 10 ounces for a bucks and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.030 
buck versus 10 ounces for a bucks and
this<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.299> better<00:03:54.510> deal<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.620> got<00:03:55.859> these

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
this is a better deal but I got these

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.430 
this is a better deal but I got these
three<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.579> in<00:03:56.730> case<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.389> wanted<00:03:57.780> them<00:03:57.870> down

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
three just in case we wanted them down

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.229 
three just in case we wanted them down
the<00:03:58.590> cost<00:03:58.769> efficient<00:03:59.129> side<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.400> got<00:03:59.579> this<00:03:59.819> and

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
the cost efficient side you got this and

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.960 
the cost efficient side you got this and
I<00:04:00.419> did<00:04:00.569> actually<00:04:00.870> buy<00:04:01.049> some<00:04:01.430> smaller<00:04:02.430> packable

and lotions that sort of thing so if you

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.439 
and lotions that sort of thing so if you
divide<00:04:11.190> things<00:04:11.519> up<00:04:11.729> put<00:04:11.970> them<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.180> there<00:04:12.329> if

pads that type stuff that can be soaked

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.190 
pads that type stuff that can be soaked
up<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.630> cotton<00:04:21.900> balls<00:04:22.049> will<00:04:22.139> be

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
up the cotton balls will be

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.260 
up the cotton balls will be
general-purpose<00:04:23.099> better<00:04:23.520> probably<00:04:24.000> and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
general-purpose better probably and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.000 
general-purpose better probably and
finally<00:04:25.169> on<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.320> list<00:04:25.530> which<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.710> going<00:04:25.889> to

in<00:04:26.419> my<00:04:26.660> cooking<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.530> warmth<00:04:28.009> kit<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.430> all

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
in my cooking and warmth kit and all

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.150 
in my cooking and warmth kit and all
that<00:04:28.729> but<00:04:28.880> should<00:04:29.780> factor<00:04:30.050> in<00:04:30.319> with<00:04:30.440> tender<00:04:30.740> is

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
that but should factor in with tender is

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.670 
that but should factor in with tender is
isopropyl<00:04:31.759> alcohol<00:04:31.849> you<00:04:32.810> could<00:04:32.990> soak<00:04:33.289> one<00:04:33.530> of

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
isopropyl alcohol you could soak one of

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.070 
isopropyl alcohol you could soak one of
the<00:04:33.889> cotton<00:04:34.729> balls<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.030> isopropyl<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.810> get<00:04:36.050> a

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
the cotton balls and isopropyl and get a

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.370 
the cotton balls and isopropyl and get a
nice<00:04:36.289> flame<00:04:36.530> there<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.099> that's<00:04:37.970> an<00:04:38.060> option

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
nice flame there so that's an option

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.020 
nice flame there so that's an option
also<00:04:39.380> we're<00:04:39.860> gonna<00:04:39.949> put<00:04:40.099> my<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.250> isopropyl<00:04:40.819> in

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
also we're gonna put my the isopropyl in

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.059 
also we're gonna put my the isopropyl in
grander<00:04:41.780> detail<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.349> don't<00:04:42.620> think<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:42.889> is<00:04:42.949> the

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
grander detail I don't think this is the

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.180 
grander detail I don't think this is the
best<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.789> tender<00:04:44.590> but<00:04:45.590> let's<00:04:45.710> do<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.069> there

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
best for tender but let's do it in there

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.400 
best for tender but let's do it in there
just<00:04:46.220> because<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.910> fits<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.720> figure<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.349> best

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
just because it fits I figure the best

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.860 
just because it fits I figure the best
for<00:04:48.680> tender<00:04:48.949> is<00:04:49.039> gonna<00:04:49.190> be<00:04:49.400> cotton<00:04:50.120> balls<00:04:50.479> with

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
for tender is gonna be cotton balls with

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.379 
for tender is gonna be cotton balls with
either<00:04:51.110> Vaseline<00:04:51.919> or<00:04:53.020> your<00:04:54.020> hand<00:04:54.590> gel<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.389> let

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
either Vaseline or your hand gel so let
