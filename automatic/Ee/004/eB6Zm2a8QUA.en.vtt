00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.250
 friends 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.660
 how about friends goiter tehuana puntocom 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.400
 I'm booking here we are with jackie 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.469
 nava since you just returned by the 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.509
 big door here in tijuana its rival to 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.160
 Liz Sanchez introduced at the beginning 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.960
 some problems but then you 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.640
 you raise and you continue with a fight 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.500
 excellent night so how do you feel 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.240
 Well the truth is happy if 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.369
 It was a bit difficult 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.689
 you can grab the distance the rhythm 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.699
 Well, it was also a little bit more 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.259
 long than me but I think that because 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.120
 we had seen out there is from the work of 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.100
 she did what she did and so we were there 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.839
 we were guided by that for that 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.210
 path 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.610
 maybe I did not pay attention to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.159
 my Chinese friends but but I think that because 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.659
 there is a job that did this 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.670
 this one so to be able to win comes to 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.769
 you said your corner 'after that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.479
 fall in the first assault that tells you 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.470
 to go out to the second and to give it the 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.720
 return to the form that does not exist 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.670
 I really saw them calm about this one 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.420
 They saw that I did not feel bad that 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.250
 not that I do not know that I'm not 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.629
 really hurt them what 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.890
 calm and well that's good for me 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.540
 security gave me the confidence to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.950
 continue and to resume the path to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.610
 after a very important stage for 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.660
