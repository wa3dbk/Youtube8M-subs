00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and I'll get back to that in a little

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
and I'll get back to that in a little
bit<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.320> I'm<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> actual<00:00:38.219> workout<00:00:38.579> itself

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
pounds well as you guys saw earlier I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
pounds well as you guys saw earlier I
clearly<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.969> huddle<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> way

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
clearly do not know huddle all the way

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
clearly do not know huddle all the way
onto<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> bar<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.379> apparently<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.399> don't<00:00:56.520> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
onto the bar and apparently I don't know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.420 
onto the bar and apparently I don't know
how<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.120> math<00:00:57.329> either<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.559> term

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
how to do math either because this term

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.840 
how to do math either because this term
as<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.760> turns<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.710> 260<00:01:01.710> pounds<00:01:02.129> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
as it turns out is not 260 pounds this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.190 
as it turns out is not 260 pounds this
is<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.619> 275<00:01:04.619> pounds<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.450> realized

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is actually 275 pounds so I realized

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
is actually 275 pounds so I realized
this<00:01:07.320> around<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.680> third<00:01:08.130> set<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.240> decided

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
this around my third set and I decided

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.289 
this around my third set and I decided
just<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.460> because

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
just to just to go with it because

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.140 
just to just to go with it because
previously<00:01:12.780> 275<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> had<00:01:13.979> only<00:01:14.130> done<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.939> maybe

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
previously 275 I had only done for maybe

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.719 
previously 275 I had only done for maybe
a<00:01:15.240> set<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> three<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> believe<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.520> most

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

a set of three I believe was my the most
i've<00:01:17.880> ever<00:01:17.970> done<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.720> 275<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:21.210> i<00:01:21.450> was

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
i've ever done with 275 and this i was

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
i've ever done with 275 and this i was
able<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.080> five<00:01:22.380> sets<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:23.060> granted

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
around the fourth set or so it starts

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
around the fourth set or so it starts
looking<00:01:26.580> pretty<00:01:27.119> ugly<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.470> got<00:01:28.950> it

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
looking pretty ugly but I got it

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560 
looking pretty ugly but I got it

nonetheless and we'll talk about that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
nonetheless and we'll talk about that
ugly<00:01:30.990> set<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.369> stay<00:01:32.670> tuned

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.639 
and stay nice and settled it took me a
long<00:01:54.299> time<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.170> comfortable<00:01:55.530> with

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
long time to really get comfortable with

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.139 
long time to really get comfortable with
the<00:01:55.829> front<00:01:56.040> squat<00:01:56.310> especially<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.939> front

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the front squat especially in that front

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.469 
the front squat especially in that front
rack<00:01:57.360> position<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.070> basically<00:01:59.070> the<00:02:00.000> bar<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
rack position and basically the bar is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.630 
rack position and basically the bar is
almost<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:01.680> neck<00:02:01.950> I'm<00:02:02.130> almost<00:02:02.340> choking

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
almost on my neck I'm almost choking

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
almost on my neck I'm almost choking
myself<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.930> close<00:02:04.200> it's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
myself and if it's not that close it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.289 
myself and if it's not that close it's
really<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.219> very<00:02:05.490> uncomfortable<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.240> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
really just very uncomfortable and I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.730 
really just very uncomfortable and I
don't<00:02:06.540> feel<00:02:06.750> strong<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.200> all

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
don't feel strong at all

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.979 
don't feel strong at all
so<00:02:08.250> these<00:02:08.489> overall<00:02:09.179> are<00:02:09.300> looking<00:02:09.569> pretty<00:02:09.720> good

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
so these overall are looking pretty good

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.140 
so these overall are looking pretty good
and<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.440> actually<00:02:10.590> my<00:02:10.979> third<00:02:11.310> set<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:12.000> of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and this is actually my third set out of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.710 
and this is actually my third set out of
5<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:14.040> know<00:02:14.160> obviously<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.910> see<00:02:15.150> I'm<00:02:15.270> I'm

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
5 you know obviously you can see I'm I'm

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
5 you know obviously you can see I'm I'm
struggling<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.410> bit<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> most

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
struggling a little bit but for the most

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.640 
struggling a little bit but for the most
part<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:17.970> not<00:02:18.120> too<00:02:18.360> bad<00:02:18.599> what<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> didn't

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
part it's not too bad what I didn't

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.160 
part it's not too bad what I didn't
realize<00:02:19.760> was<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.790> fatigue<00:02:21.720> was<00:02:21.930> really

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
realize was that fatigue was really

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.890 
realize was that fatigue was really
starting<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.739> kick<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.700> come<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.300> set<00:02:24.510> for

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
starting to kick in so come to set for

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.820 
starting to kick in so come to set for
and<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.099> where<00:02:26.310> disaster<00:02:26.849> strikes<00:02:27.830> first

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
and this is where disaster strikes first

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.440 
and this is where disaster strikes first

videos every two or three days and then

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.869 
videos every two or three days and then
sometimes<00:05:33.750> it'll<00:05:33.990> go<00:05:34.259> once<00:05:35.250> a<00:05:35.400> week<00:05:35.430> or<00:05:35.819> once

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.559 
every week and a half and unfortunately
that's<00:05:38.129> just<00:05:38.219> the<00:05:38.430> nature<00:05:38.639> of<00:05:38.759> the<00:05:38.879> beast<00:05:39.120> has

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
that's just the nature of the beast has

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.939 
that's just the nature of the beast has
a<00:05:39.629> third-year<00:05:40.020> medical<00:05:40.259> student<00:05:40.469> I'm<00:05:40.770> in<00:05:40.860> the

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
a third-year medical student I'm in the

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.820 
a third-year medical student I'm in the
hospital<00:05:41.099> about<00:05:41.879> six<00:05:42.180> days<00:05:42.300> a<00:05:42.360> week<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:42.870> I'm

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
hospital about six days a week and I'm

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.680 
hospital about six days a week and I'm
also<00:05:44.099> training<00:05:44.370> six<00:05:44.729> days<00:05:44.879> a<00:05:44.909> week<00:05:45.029> with<00:05:45.419> my

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.839 
also training six days a week with my
trainings<00:05:46.139> basically<00:05:46.979> averaging<00:05:47.099> about<00:05:47.580> two

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
trainings basically averaging about two

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.879 
trainings basically averaging about two
to<00:05:48.000> two<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.270> half<00:05:48.389> hours<00:05:48.659> per<00:05:48.900> session<00:05:49.169> so

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
to two and a half hours per session so

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.079 
to two and a half hours per session so
sometimes<00:05:50.129> there's<00:05:50.550> just<00:05:50.580> not<00:05:50.789> enough<00:05:50.849> time

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.089 
sometimes there's just not enough time

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:53.659 
sometimes there's just not enough time
to<00:05:51.569> do<00:05:52.289> everything<00:05:52.319> get<00:05:53.159> an<00:05:53.250> adequate<00:05:53.520> amount

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
to do everything get an adequate amount

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.670 
to do everything get an adequate amount
of<00:05:53.909> sleep<00:05:53.969> which<00:05:54.960> for<00:05:55.139> the<00:05:55.229> most<00:05:55.379> part<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.620> my

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
of sleep which for the most part of my

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.829 
of sleep which for the most part of my
sleep<00:05:55.919> is<00:05:56.039> not<00:05:56.250> really<00:05:56.490> adequate<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:57.750> know

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839 
sleep is not really adequate you know

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.540 
sleep is not really adequate you know
and<00:05:57.990> really<00:05:58.139> do<00:05:58.289> everything<00:05:58.560> else<00:05:58.740> so<00:05:59.039> I'll<00:05:59.310> do

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
videos are not going to be as frequent

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.409 
videos are not going to be as frequent
as<00:06:04.889> you'd<00:06:05.039> like<00:06:05.099> so<00:06:05.819> back<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.029> the<00:06:06.210> training

footage after those high bar squats have
moved<00:06:08.490> on<00:06:08.669> to<00:06:08.819> some<00:06:09.029> deficit<00:06:09.539> straight<00:06:09.779> leg

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
moved on to some deficit straight leg

moved on to some deficit straight leg
deadlift<00:06:10.439> beltless<00:06:11.400> of<00:06:11.610> course<00:06:11.849> did<00:06:12.689> that

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839 
deadlift beltless of course did that

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.959 
deadlift beltless of course did that
first<00:06:12.990> one<00:06:13.199> double<00:06:13.529> overhand<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.250> I<00:06:14.610> really

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
first one double overhand and I really

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.129 
first one double overhand and I really
couldn't<00:06:15.180> handle<00:06:15.509> that<00:06:15.659> because<00:06:15.839> I<00:06:16.050> have

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
couldn't handle that because I have

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.260 
couldn't handle that because I have
bitch<00:06:16.319> hands<00:06:16.680> so<00:06:17.219> I<00:06:17.250> moved<00:06:17.699> over<00:06:17.819> to<00:06:18.029> switch

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
bitch hands so I moved over to switch

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.869 
bitch hands so I moved over to switch
grip<00:06:18.479> and<00:06:18.750> continued<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.379> set<00:06:19.650> anyway<00:06:20.639> this

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879 
grip and continued the set anyway this

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.550 
grip and continued the set anyway this
is<00:06:21.060> a<00:06:21.089> really<00:06:21.389> solid<00:06:21.599> movement<00:06:22.080> in<00:06:22.139> my<00:06:22.259> opinion

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
is a really solid movement in my opinion

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.059 
is a really solid movement in my opinion
really<00:06:22.889> hammers<00:06:23.400> home<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:24.210> posterior<00:06:24.629> chain

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
really hammers home that posterior chain

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.490 
really hammers home that posterior chain
particularly<00:06:26.069> low<00:06:26.339> back<00:06:26.580> and<00:06:26.849> the<00:06:26.909> hamstring

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
particularly low back and the hamstring

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.530 
particularly low back and the hamstring
and<00:06:27.740> for<00:06:28.340> a<00:06:28.370> lot<00:06:28.490> of<00:06:28.550> people<00:06:28.790> that's<00:06:29.090> actually

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
and for a lot of people that's actually

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.350 
and for a lot of people that's actually
a<00:06:29.780> bigger<00:06:30.050> weakness<00:06:30.530> then<00:06:30.770> I<00:06:31.070> think<00:06:31.460> we<00:06:32.090> will

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
a bigger weakness then I think we will

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.630 
a bigger weakness then I think we will
admit<00:06:32.720> I<00:06:32.960> know<00:06:33.320> personally<00:06:33.620> I<00:06:33.950> was<00:06:34.250> kind<00:06:34.460> of<00:06:34.520> in

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
admit I know personally I was kind of in

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.130 
admit I know personally I was kind of in
denial<00:06:34.730> that<00:06:35.210> that<00:06:35.360> was<00:06:35.480> a<00:06:35.510> weakness<00:06:35.720> of<00:06:35.960> my

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
denial that that was a weakness of my

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.110 
denial that that was a weakness of my
own<00:06:36.290> and<00:06:36.560> I<00:06:36.950> know<00:06:37.040> a<00:06:37.130> lot<00:06:37.430> of<00:06:37.490> people<00:06:37.610> when<00:06:37.970> they

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
own and I know a lot of people when they

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.730 
own and I know a lot of people when they
get<00:06:38.240> stronger<00:06:38.480> that<00:06:38.780> kind<00:06:38.990> of<00:06:39.050> becomes<00:06:39.410> one<00:06:39.710> of

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
get stronger that kind of becomes one of

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.340 
get stronger that kind of becomes one of
the<00:06:39.830> limiting<00:06:40.250> factors<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:41.780> I<00:06:41.930> can<00:06:42.140> say<00:06:42.320> for

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
the limiting factors and I can say for

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.860 
the limiting factors and I can say for
sure<00:06:42.590> that<00:06:43.250> that<00:06:44.240> has<00:06:44.390> been<00:06:44.570> the<00:06:44.660> case<00:06:44.690> for

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
sure that that has been the case for

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.720 
sure that that has been the case for
myself<00:06:45.410> and<00:06:45.680> for<00:06:45.710> a<00:06:45.890> lot<00:06:46.010> of<00:06:46.070> other<00:06:46.280> people<00:06:46.490> who

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
myself and for a lot of other people who

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.850 
myself and for a lot of other people who
are<00:06:46.760> much<00:06:47.000> stronger<00:06:47.210> than<00:06:47.390> me<00:06:47.630> on<00:06:48.500> their

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
are much stronger than me on their

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.040 
are much stronger than me on their
journey<00:06:49.160> of<00:06:49.370> getting<00:06:49.610> stronger<00:06:49.940> that<00:06:50.750> has

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
journey of getting stronger that has

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.070 
journey of getting stronger that has
turned<00:06:51.290> out<00:06:51.470> to<00:06:51.650> be<00:06:51.830> a<00:06:52.190> weak<00:06:52.760> link<00:06:53.060> so<00:06:53.690> I<00:06:53.720> would

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
turned out to be a weak link so I would

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.350 
turned out to be a weak link so I would
recommend<00:06:54.110> that<00:06:54.680> people<00:06:54.860> work<00:06:55.730> on<00:06:55.910> that<00:06:56.150> in

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
recommend that people work on that in

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.910 
recommend that people work on that in
advance<00:06:56.540> to<00:06:57.020> make<00:06:57.050> sure<00:06:57.290> it<00:06:57.380> doesn't<00:06:57.560> become<00:06:57.890> a

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
advance to make sure it doesn't become a

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.970 
advance to make sure it doesn't become a
weak<00:06:58.190> link<00:06:58.430> so<00:06:59.240> anyway<00:06:59.690> you<00:07:00.530> might<00:07:00.680> not<00:07:00.890> have

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
weak link so anyway you might not have

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.830 
weak link so anyway you might not have
noticed<00:07:01.190> from<00:07:01.400> this<00:07:01.610> video<00:07:01.910> that<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.540> lot<00:07:02.810> of

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
noticed from this video that a lot of

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.110 
noticed from this video that a lot of
the<00:07:02.990> reps<00:07:03.230> are<00:07:03.470> looking<00:07:03.800> overall<00:07:04.430> pretty<00:07:04.700> fast

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
the reps are looking overall pretty fast

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.690 
the reps are looking overall pretty fast
meaning<00:07:06.020> that<00:07:06.169> you<00:07:06.650> know<00:07:06.770> it's<00:07:07.100> obviously<00:07:07.580> not

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
meaning that you know it's obviously not

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.610 
meaning that you know it's obviously not
a<00:07:07.970> super<00:07:08.480> high<00:07:08.660> intensity<00:07:09.169> it's<00:07:09.440> not

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
a super high intensity it's not

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.770 
a super high intensity it's not
extremely<00:07:10.250> challenging<00:07:10.820> for<00:07:11.030> me<00:07:11.150> and<00:07:11.360> the

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
extremely challenging for me and the

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.450 
extremely challenging for me and the
reason<00:07:11.930> for<00:07:12.080> that<00:07:12.260> is<00:07:12.470> because<00:07:12.500> as<00:07:13.040> I

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
reason for that is because as I

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.370 
reason for that is because as I
mentioned<00:07:13.490> earlier<00:07:13.910> in<00:07:14.210> this<00:07:14.300> video<00:07:14.480> this<00:07:15.200> is

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
mentioned earlier in this video this is

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.130 
mentioned earlier in this video this is
my<00:07:15.560> kind<00:07:16.100> of<00:07:16.280> bonus<00:07:16.550> lower-body<00:07:17.060> day<00:07:17.390> so<00:07:17.990> the

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
my kind of bonus lower-body day so the

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.020 
my kind of bonus lower-body day so the
goal<00:07:18.350> is<00:07:18.380> really<00:07:18.680> just<00:07:18.890> to<00:07:18.980> get<00:07:19.190> extra<00:07:19.400> work<00:07:19.790> in

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
goal is really just to get extra work in

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.740 
goal is really just to get extra work in
the<00:07:20.210> goal<00:07:20.419> is<00:07:20.630> not<00:07:20.810> necessarily<00:07:21.350> to<00:07:21.919> work<00:07:22.190> to<00:07:22.750> a

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
the goal is not necessarily to work to a

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.560 
the goal is not necessarily to work to a
point<00:07:24.440> of<00:07:24.680> exertion<00:07:25.400> that<00:07:26.210> will<00:07:26.419> really

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570 
point of exertion that will really

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.970 
point of exertion that will really
fatigued<00:07:27.050> me<00:07:27.230> and<00:07:27.500> prevent<00:07:27.830> me<00:07:27.950> from

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
fatigued me and prevent me from

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.430 
fatigued me and prevent me from
continuing<00:07:28.610> to<00:07:29.240> put<00:07:29.450> in<00:07:29.660> some<00:07:29.690> solid<00:07:30.140> effort

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
continuing to put in some solid effort

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.950 
continuing to put in some solid effort
on<00:07:30.560> my<00:07:30.710> real<00:07:31.400> workouts<00:07:31.910> which<00:07:32.360> focus<00:07:32.720> on<00:07:32.840> the

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
on my real workouts which focus on the

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.020 
on my real workouts which focus on the
power<00:07:33.169> lifts<00:07:33.560> obviously<00:07:34.430> since<00:07:34.580> I'm<00:07:34.760> a<00:07:34.790> power
