affected by cancer and that really gives

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.679 
affected by cancer and that really gives
a<00:00:18.619> heart<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.190> cause<00:00:19.400> it<00:00:19.939> makes<00:00:20.270> you<00:00:20.450> want

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
to really work hard at something you'll

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.580 
to really work hard at something you'll
notice<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.150> lot<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.390> people<00:00:23.689> in<00:00:23.990> cancer

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
research have been affected by it

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.480 
research have been affected by it
personally<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.140> worked<00:00:28.010> a<00:00:28.100> lot<00:00:28.220> at<00:00:28.369> the

personally I worked a lot at the
hospital<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:29.210> I<00:00:29.300> was<00:00:29.390> around<00:00:29.510> a<00:00:29.630> lot<00:00:29.720> of

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
hospital and I was around a lot of

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.540 
hospital and I was around a lot of
doctors<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.410> what<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:30.560> realized<00:00:30.949> about<00:00:31.039> myself

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
doctors and what I realized about myself

doctors and what I realized about myself
was<00:00:32.480> that<00:00:32.510> I<00:00:32.690> really<00:00:33.260> loved<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.739> research

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
was that I really loved the research

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.450 
was that I really loved the research
behind<00:00:34.309> it<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:35.260> started<00:00:36.260> out<00:00:36.410> as<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.590> California

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460

Angeles<00:00:39.590> my<00:00:40.309> training<00:00:40.850> is<00:00:40.940> in<00:00:40.970> mathematics

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
Angeles my training is in mathematics

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.649 
Angeles my training is in mathematics
and<00:00:42.019> ultimately<00:00:42.500> statistics<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.729> I<00:00:44.360> became

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
and ultimately statistics and I became

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.360 
and ultimately statistics and I became
very<00:00:44.720> interested<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:45.470> sort<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:45.860> clinical

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
very interested in sort of clinical

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.820 
very interested in sort of clinical
trials<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.659> discovered<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.440> I<00:00:48.500> really

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
trials and discovered that I really

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.070 
trials and discovered that I really
found<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.400> issues<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:49.940> real<00:00:50.180> clinical<00:00:50.720> trials

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
found the issues in real clinical trials

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.539 
found the issues in real clinical trials
at<00:00:51.260> least<00:00:51.470> as<00:00:51.680> interesting<00:00:52.159> as<00:00:52.250> some<00:00:52.400> of<00:00:52.489> the

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
at least as interesting as some of the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.399 
at least as interesting as some of the
theoretical<00:00:52.879> issues<00:00:53.420> as<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.629> how<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.930> analyze

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
theoretical issues as to how to analyze

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.189 
theoretical issues as to how to analyze
them<00:00:57.430> they<00:00:58.430> much<00:00:58.850> ingrain<00:00:59.479> and<00:00:59.720> us<00:00:59.839> really

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
them they much ingrain and us really

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.719 
them they much ingrain and us really
early<00:01:00.440> on<00:01:00.589> that<00:01:01.100> we<00:01:01.220> need<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.519> collaborate

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
early on that we need to collaborate

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.670 
early on that we need to collaborate
with<00:01:02.000> each<00:01:02.120> other<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.659> have<00:01:02.869> five<00:01:03.440> different

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
with each other I have five different

group projects going on right now the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.380 
group projects going on right now the
cool<00:01:06.979> thing<00:01:07.010> about<00:01:07.430> London<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.000> Queen<00:01:08.210> Mary

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
cool thing about London and Queen Mary

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.510 
cool thing about London and Queen Mary
is<00:01:08.750> most<00:01:09.680> of<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.920> students<00:01:10.310> here<00:01:10.490> are

as well come from different backgrounds
you<00:01:19.820> know<00:01:19.969> I<00:01:20.000> did<00:01:20.270> nutritional<00:01:20.780> science<00:01:21.079> and

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
you know I did nutritional science and

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.660 
you know I did nutritional science and
chemistry<00:01:21.350> I'm<00:01:21.920> working<00:01:22.250> with<00:01:22.369> people<00:01:22.640> who

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
chemistry I'm working with people who

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.060 
chemistry I'm working with people who
are<00:01:22.880> already<00:01:23.030> doctors<00:01:23.659> pharmacists<00:01:24.500> maybe

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
are already doctors pharmacists maybe

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.980 
are already doctors pharmacists maybe
someone<00:01:25.369> who<00:01:25.460> did<00:01:25.609> biochemistry<00:01:26.359> so<00:01:26.840> it's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
someone who did biochemistry so it's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.169 
someone who did biochemistry so it's
kind<00:01:27.259> of<00:01:27.350> cool<00:01:27.920> because<00:01:27.950> we<00:01:28.369> can<00:01:28.609> all<00:01:28.759> put<00:01:29.000> our

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
kind of cool because we can all put our

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.669 
kind of cool because we can all put our
own<00:01:29.299> perspective<00:01:30.109> on<00:01:30.259> things

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
own perspective on things

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.620 
own perspective on things
so<00:01:31.070> you've<00:01:31.280> seen<00:01:31.520> tissue<00:01:32.240> into<00:01:32.539> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
so you've seen tissue into the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.300 
so you've seen tissue into the
microscope<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:33.409> maybe<00:01:33.649> you'd<00:01:33.829> like<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.009> see

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
microscope so maybe you'd like to see

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.940 
microscope so maybe you'd like to see
where<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:35.329> get<00:01:35.539> that<00:01:35.780> okay

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.380 

yeah<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.370> can<00:01:40.550> feel<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:40.880> difference<00:01:41.210> guys

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
yeah you can feel the difference guys

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.490 
yeah you can feel the difference guys
wasting<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.830> see<00:01:43.040> it's<00:01:43.520> quite<00:01:44.230> easy<00:01:45.230> to

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
wasting and you see it's quite easy to

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.470 
wasting and you see it's quite easy to
distinguish<00:01:46.130> from<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.430> surrounding<00:01:46.910> tissue

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
distinguish from the surrounding tissue

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.040 
distinguish from the surrounding tissue
it's<00:01:48.020> very<00:01:48.230> pale<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:49.760> actually<00:01:50.330> feels<00:01:50.690> very

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
it's very pale it actually feels very

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.710 
it's very pale it actually feels very
firm<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:51.770> when<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.070> run<00:01:52.340> my<00:01:52.520> finger<00:01:53.000> across<00:01:53.150> here

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
firm so when I run my finger across here

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.380 
firm so when I run my finger across here
you<00:01:54.290> can<00:01:54.500> feel<00:01:54.860> when<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.340> get<00:01:55.520> on<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.150> tool

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
you can feel when you get on to the tool

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.060 
you can feel when you get on to the tool
and<00:01:56.570> it's<00:01:56.780> interesting<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.410> think<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.890> you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
and it's interesting to think that you

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.920 
and it's interesting to think that you
know<00:01:58.190> this<00:01:58.370> is<00:01:58.550> this<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.180> about<00:01:59.360> 25

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
know this is this is about 25

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.290 
know this is this is about 25
millimeters<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:00.860> can't<00:02:01.430> feel<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> 25

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
millimeters you can't feel a 25

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.930 
millimeters you can't feel a 25
millimeter<00:02:02.690> chair<00:02:03.170> how<00:02:03.770> how<00:02:04.370> big<00:02:04.700> does

going<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.510> within<00:02:35.720> cells<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.010> typically

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
going on within cells and you typically

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160 
going on within cells and you typically
need<00:02:37.520> four<00:02:38.000> or<00:02:38.120> five<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.570> these<00:02:38.660> before<00:02:39.140> you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
need four or five of these before you

need four or five of these before you
get<00:02:39.440> cancer<00:02:39.770> so<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.490> accumulating<00:02:41.210> over

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
determining which ones are true what's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.880 
determining which ones are true what's
different<00:03:05.840> from<00:03:05.900> America<00:03:06.290> it's<00:03:06.470> only<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.770> year

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
different from America it's only a year

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.430 
different from America it's only a year
and<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:08.239> America<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.989> do<00:03:09.080> two<00:03:09.230> years

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
and in America you have to do two years

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.010 
and in America you have to do two years
so<00:03:10.340> it's<00:03:10.520> nice<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.510> can<00:03:11.660> get<00:03:11.810> an<00:03:11.900> entire

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
so it's nice that you can get an entire

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.020 
so it's nice that you can get an entire
master's<00:03:12.620> done<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:12.980> one<00:03:13.160> year<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.790> then<00:03:13.910> you

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
master's done in one year and then you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.559 
master's done in one year and then you
can<00:03:14.180> focus<00:03:14.390> on<00:03:14.660> doing<00:03:14.750> more

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
can focus on doing more

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.080 
can focus on doing more
doing<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.930> PhD<00:03:16.249> going<00:03:17.249> back<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.519> medical<00:03:17.849> school

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
