he has to do it very slowly so the air

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.590 
he has to do it very slowly so the air
bubbles<00:00:59.980> come<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.760> top

watch empty to dry out so you can remove

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.050 
watch empty to dry out so you can remove
it<00:01:16.720> from<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.049> mold

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.850 

the<00:01:20.570> Li<00:01:20.720> now<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.140> just<00:01:21.350> opening<00:01:21.740> them<00:01:21.950> all<00:01:22.100> door

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.520 

and<00:01:28.340> he<00:01:28.400> does<00:01:28.580> it<00:01:28.610> all<00:01:28.790> very<00:01:29.030> carefully<00:01:29.660> there

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
and he does it all very carefully there

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.070 
and he does it all very carefully there
will<00:01:30.710> be<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.920> slight<00:01:31.480> molding<00:01:32.480> mark<00:01:32.840> all<00:01:33.050> the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
will be a slight molding mark all the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.660 
will be a slight molding mark all the
way<00:01:33.200> around<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.710> edge<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.920> will<00:01:37.040> be<00:01:37.220> removed

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
way around the edge that will be removed

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.600 
way around the edge that will be removed
with<00:01:38.090> fettling<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.810> spongy

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.850 

so<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> first<00:01:42.780> stage

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
so about the first stage

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.250 
so about the first stage
then<00:01:45.400> second<00:01:45.940> stage<00:01:46.150> which<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.420> all<00:01:46.690> spawns

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
then second stage which is all spawns

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.460 
then second stage which is all spawns
fettled<00:01:47.890> dried<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.180> cleaned<00:01:49.300> they'll<00:01:50.170> go<00:01:50.350> in

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
fettled dried and cleaned they'll go in

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.200 
fettled dried and cleaned they'll go in
the<00:01:50.500> kiln<00:01:50.830> twelve<00:01:51.340> hundred<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.730> five<00:01:51.970> degrees

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
the kiln twelve hundred and five degrees

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.600 
the kiln twelve hundred and five degrees
centigrade<00:01:53.050> which<00:01:53.830> comes<00:01:54.130> out<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.370> the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
centigrade which comes out in the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.060 
centigrade which comes out in the
biscuit<00:01:54.790> format<00:01:55.480> but<00:01:56.320> she's<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.590> same<00:01:56.620> as

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
biscuit format but she's the same as

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.230 
biscuit format but she's the same as
this<00:01:57.280> but<00:01:57.910> just<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.270> biscuit<00:01:58.690> which<00:01:58.990> has<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.170> 20%

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this but just in biscuit which has a 20%

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.090 
this but just in biscuit which has a 20%
shrinkage<00:02:01.240> because<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.380> clay<00:02:02.560> shrinks<00:02:02.800> in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
shrinkage because the clay shrinks in

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.640 
shrinkage because the clay shrinks in
the<00:02:03.190> firing<00:02:03.430> at<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.820> temperature<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.470> we

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
the firing at that temperature then we

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.240 
the firing at that temperature then we
go<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:06.180> bucket<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.420> glaze<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.770> it's<00:02:08.920> dipped

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
go to a bucket of glaze and it's dipped

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.190 
go to a bucket of glaze and it's dipped
in<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.550> bucket<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:09.940> glaze<00:02:10.980> shaken<00:02:12.060> dried<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
in a bucket of glaze shaken dried and

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.790 
in a bucket of glaze shaken dried and
fired<00:02:14.590> again<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:16.030> ten<00:02:16.450> eighty<00:02:17.140> degrees

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
fired again about ten eighty degrees

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.280 
fired again about ten eighty degrees
centigrade<00:02:18.490> then<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.420> comes<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
centigrade then you comes out the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.350 
centigrade then you comes out the
finished<00:02:20.620> piece<00:02:20.830> all<00:02:21.070> nice<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.640> glazed<00:02:21.820> it's

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
finished piece all nice and glazed it's

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.970 
finished piece all nice and glazed it's
not<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.660> film<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.500> glass<00:02:23.739> all<00:02:24.010> over

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.900 

this<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.310> first<00:02:30.610> stage<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.150> hand<00:02:31.450> painting

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
this is the first stage of hand painting

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410 
this is the first stage of hand painting
this<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.060> done<00:02:34.300> same<00:02:35.230> way<00:02:35.379> 200<00:02:35.890> years<00:02:36.069> ago<00:02:36.420> it's

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
this is done same way 200 years ago it's

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.600 
this is done same way 200 years ago it's
mainly<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:38.080> get<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> covering<00:02:38.800> over<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.430> whole

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
mainly to get a covering over the whole

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.320 
mainly to get a covering over the whole
pot<00:02:39.879> and<00:02:40.620> leaves<00:02:41.620> no<00:02:42.040> hardly<00:02:42.459> any<00:02:42.550> white<00:02:42.819> on<00:02:43.180> it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
pot and leaves no hardly any white on it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.270 
pot and leaves no hardly any white on it
so<00:02:44.319> we<00:02:44.470> recover<00:02:44.950> all<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:46.290> very<00:02:47.290> tight<00:02:47.590> areas

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
so we recover all the very tight areas

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.880 
so we recover all the very tight areas
first<00:02:51.660> what<00:02:52.660> we're<00:02:52.810> doing<00:02:53.049> now<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.379> building<00:02:53.410> a

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
first what we're doing now is building a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:03.610 
first what we're doing now is building a
base<00:02:54.069> up<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.360> can<00:02:55.569> smoothly<00:02:55.959> feather<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.680> off

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.920 

and<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:04.830> happens<00:03:05.280> as<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.180> call<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.569> drying

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and what happens as the call is drying

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.009 
and what happens as the call is drying
it<00:03:07.459> allows<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.940> build<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.330> base<00:03:09.510> off<00:03:09.840> as

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
it allows you to build a base off as

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.400 
it allows you to build a base off as
well<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.879> give<00:03:11.879> something<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.450> deity<00:03:15.410> so

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
well on it give something to a deity so

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.040 
well on it give something to a deity so
we<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:16.680> leave<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.160> part<00:03:17.489> now<00:03:17.840> safely<00:03:18.840> near

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
we just leave that part now safely near

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.699 
we just leave that part now safely near
and<00:03:19.260> off<00:03:19.349> covering<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.780> stick<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.560> on

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
and off covering it and we stick it on

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.940 
and off covering it and we stick it on
the<00:03:22.830> wheel<00:03:25.700> then<00:03:26.700> go<00:03:26.880> around<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.300> base<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.950> get

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
the wheel then go around the base to get

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:40.280 
the wheel then go around the base to get
the<00:03:29.930> right<00:03:30.930> shape<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.620> urn<00:03:31.739> at<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.069> bottom

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.050 

so<00:03:41.290> its<00:03:41.440> first<00:03:41.590> coating<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:42.190> paint<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.910> it's

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
so its first coating of paint and it's

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.340 
so its first coating of paint and it's
going<00:03:43.330> in<00:03:43.480> for<00:03:43.630> its<00:03:43.720> first<00:03:44.080> five<00:03:44.380> in<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.740> three

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
going in for its first five in a three

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.220 
going in for its first five in a three
you<00:03:47.350> pop<00:03:47.650> her<00:03:47.800> in<00:03:47.950> there<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.690> we'll<00:03:49.870> see<00:03:50.110> her

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
you pop her in there and we'll see her

00:03:50.230 --> 00:04:01.500 
you pop her in there and we'll see her
in<00:03:50.290> seven<00:03:50.650> hours<00:03:50.890> time

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.270 

just<00:04:01.689> gonna<00:04:01.870> open<00:04:02.530> up<00:04:02.650> now<00:04:03.239> after<00:04:04.239> its<00:04:04.360> firing

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
just gonna open up now after its firing

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.899 
just gonna open up now after its firing
and<00:04:06.280> everything<00:04:06.640> should<00:04:06.819> be<00:04:06.849> fine<00:04:07.120> yes<00:04:07.569> it<00:04:07.810> is

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
and everything should be fine yes it is

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.539 
and everything should be fine yes it is
so<00:04:09.909> that<00:04:10.000> said<00:04:10.150> its<00:04:10.299> first<00:04:10.629> firing<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:12.430> now

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
so that said its first firing and now

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.949 
so that said its first firing and now
it's<00:04:12.700> ready<00:04:12.879> for<00:04:12.939> its<00:04:13.060> second<00:04:13.480> coating<00:04:13.689> of

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
it's ready for its second coating of

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.170 
it's ready for its second coating of
paint

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.910 

back<00:04:19.180> out<00:04:19.360> of<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.660> kiln<00:04:20.110> after<00:04:20.410> its<00:04:20.530> second

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
back out of the kiln after its second

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.830 
back out of the kiln after its second
fire<00:04:21.100> in<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.459> red<00:04:21.670> now<00:04:22.390> it's<00:04:22.570> time<00:04:22.810> to

on<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:44.110> this<00:04:44.260> has<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.740> left<00:04:44.920> for<00:04:45.100> half

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
on it and this has to be left for half

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.570 
on it and this has to be left for half
an<00:04:45.520> hour<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.880> dry<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:47.560> we<00:04:47.650> just<00:04:47.860> put<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.430> Box

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
an hour to dry and we just put the Box

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.880 
an hour to dry and we just put the Box
down<00:04:48.760> same<00:04:49.570> thing<00:04:49.780> again<00:04:50.020> make<00:04:50.290> sure<00:04:50.320> she's<00:04:50.710> in

line on the bottom and just rub her down
now<00:04:57.340> she's<00:04:57.580> ready<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:58.180> half<00:04:58.630> an<00:04:58.840> hour<00:04:59.010> to<00:05:00.010> have

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
now she's ready in half an hour to have

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.030 
now she's ready in half an hour to have
the<00:05:00.250> base<00:05:00.400> painted<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:02.530> is<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.830> last

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
the base painted this is the last

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.360 
the base painted this is the last
application<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.150> that's<00:05:04.330> doing<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.900> base<00:05:05.370> to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
application and that's doing the base to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
application and that's doing the base to
make<00:05:06.490> it<00:05:06.610> look<00:05:06.730> like<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.940> wooden<00:05:07.210> base<00:05:08.010> so

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
make it look like a wooden base so

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.950 
make it look like a wooden base so
carefully<00:05:10.390> trim<00:05:11.050> round<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.530> top<00:05:12.750> on<00:05:13.750> the

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
carefully trim round the top on the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.590 
carefully trim round the top on the
wheel<00:05:15.990> same<00:05:16.990> as<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.440> dark<00:05:18.310> red<00:05:18.580> color<00:05:18.850> you

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
wheel same as the dark red color you

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.400 
wheel same as the dark red color you
have<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.960> build<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.350> up<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.880> cover<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.000> white

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
have to build it up to cover the white

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.350 
have to build it up to cover the white
but<00:05:23.410> with<00:05:23.560> this<00:05:23.710> one<00:05:23.950> it<00:05:24.250> only<00:05:24.550> needs<00:05:24.970> one

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
but with this one it only needs one

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.880 
but with this one it only needs one
firing<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:28.120> we<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.660> cover<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.080> as<00:05:29.260> much<00:05:29.500> as<00:05:29.710> we

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
firing so we just cover it as much as we

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.719 
firing so we just cover it as much as we
can<00:05:31.200> with<00:05:32.200> this<00:05:32.320> brush<00:05:32.620> being<00:05:32.890> so<00:05:33.100> soft<00:05:33.460> you

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
can with this brush being so soft you

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.990 
can with this brush being so soft you
just<00:05:34.090> splays<00:05:34.419> round<00:05:34.780> it's<00:05:35.229> a<00:05:35.380> good<00:05:35.560> brush<00:05:39.000> just

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
just splays round it's a good brush just

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.940 
just splays round it's a good brush just
carefully<00:05:40.600> do<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.930> bottom<00:05:43.229> turn<00:05:44.229> unibrow<00:05:44.740> so

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
carefully do the bottom turn unibrow so

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.260 
carefully do the bottom turn unibrow so
she<00:05:45.010> get<00:05:45.250> a<00:05:45.280> bit<00:05:45.430> more<00:05:45.580> color<00:05:45.820> on<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.120> other

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
she get a bit more color on the other

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.800 
she get a bit more color on the other
side<00:05:46.979> so<00:05:47.979> this<00:05:48.130> is<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.400> final<00:05:48.700> firing<00:05:49.419> now

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
side so this is the final firing now
