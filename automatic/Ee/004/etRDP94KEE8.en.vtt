then get to check the area over but then

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.300 
then get to check the area over but then
of<00:02:36.630> course<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.989> are<00:02:37.140> posting<00:02:37.500> supplies<00:02:38.070> as

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
of course you are posting supplies as

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.060 
of course you are posting supplies as
well<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.660> comes<00:02:39.870> down<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.290> low<00:02:40.410> what<00:02:40.860> kind

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
well so it comes down to low what kind

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.670 
well so it comes down to low what kind
of<00:02:41.130> style<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.519> play<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.090> want<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:42.959> and

of style of play you want to do and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.590 
of style of play you want to do and
apparently<00:02:43.890> even<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.549> character<00:02:45.030> AI<00:02:45.299> is

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
apparently even just the character AI is

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.930 
apparently even just the character AI is
influenced<00:02:46.410> by<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:46.920> play<00:02:47.130> style<00:02:47.340> as<00:02:47.519> well<00:02:47.549> so

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
influenced by your play style as well so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.610 
influenced by your play style as well so
say<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.209> example<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.840> come<00:02:49.290> up<00:02:49.380> one<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.560> the

say for example you come up one of the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
say for example you come up one of the
guys<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> gun<00:02:50.250> he's<00:02:50.910> gonna<00:02:51.060> behave<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.510> a

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
you don't use your item sensibly you

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.000 
you don't use your item sensibly you
could<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.349> stuck<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.890> situation

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
could really be stuck in a situation

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.160 
could really be stuck in a situation
that<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.640> can't<00:03:44.879> get<00:03:45.030> out<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.750> items<00:03:46.110> that

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that you can't get out of the items that

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.900 
that you can't get out of the items that
you<00:03:46.290> scavenge<00:03:46.739> are<00:03:46.920> really<00:03:47.430> important

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
you scavenge are really important

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.309 
you scavenge are really important
because<00:03:48.000> they're<00:03:48.330> basically<00:03:48.660> very<00:03:48.959> very

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
because they're basically very very

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.589 
because they're basically very very
limited<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.760> decide<00:03:50.879> how<00:03:51.390> you're

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
limited so you have to decide how you're

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.180 
limited so you have to decide how you're
gonna<00:03:51.690> use<00:03:51.989> them<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.530> know<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.709> could<00:03:53.040> make<00:03:53.160> a

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
gonna use them you know you could make a

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.979 
gonna use them you know you could make a
Molotov<00:03:53.430> cocktail<00:03:53.700> or<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.360> could<00:03:54.599> use<00:03:54.629> it<00:03:54.959> to

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
Molotov cocktail or you could use it to

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.780 
Molotov cocktail or you could use it to
fashion<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.470> health<00:03:55.680> kit<00:03:55.950> or<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.370> could<00:03:56.580> make<00:03:56.760> a

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
fashion a health kit or you could make a

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.250 
fashion a health kit or you could make a
shiv<00:03:57.060> which<00:03:57.270> could<00:03:57.450> then<00:03:57.480> be<00:03:57.599> used<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:58.020> stab

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
shiv which could then be used to stab

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.290 
shiv which could then be used to stab
someone<00:03:58.590> or<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.920> open<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> door<00:03:59.640> so<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.090> have<00:04:00.180> to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
someone or to open a door so you have to

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.270 
someone or to open a door so you have to
really<00:04:00.330> decide<00:04:01.230> what<00:04:01.590> you're<00:04:01.739> gonna<00:04:01.830> do<00:04:02.099> with

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
really decide what you're gonna do with

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.949 
really decide what you're gonna do with
these<00:04:02.400> items<00:04:02.640> because<00:04:03.180> there<00:04:03.450> aren't<00:04:03.629> loads

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
these items because there aren't loads

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.660 
these items because there aren't loads
of<00:04:04.140> them<00:04:04.290> out<00:04:04.410> there<00:04:04.470> when<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.129> goes<00:04:05.250> into<00:04:05.459> this

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
of them out there when it goes into this

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.759 
of them out there when it goes into this
you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.090> basically<00:04:06.300> see<00:04:06.690> Joel<00:04:06.989> on<00:04:07.200> screen<00:04:07.590> and

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
you can basically see Joel on screen and

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.809 
you can basically see Joel on screen and
you<00:04:07.860> can<00:04:07.950> kind<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.190> see<00:04:08.310> everything<00:04:08.730> that's

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
you can kind of see everything that's

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:09.830 
you can kind of see everything that's
going<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:09.180> while<00:04:09.480> you're<00:04:09.660> manufacturing

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
going on while you're manufacturing

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.869 
going on while you're manufacturing
these<00:04:10.440> items<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.010> can<00:04:11.160> keep<00:04:11.310> basically<00:04:11.760> an

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
these items so you can keep basically an

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.000 
these items so you can keep basically an
eye<00:04:12.000> out<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:13.260> make<00:04:13.290> sure<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.650> know<00:04:13.739> not<00:04:13.890> be

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
eye out to make sure you know not be

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.830 
eye out to make sure you know not be
attacked<00:04:14.370> by<00:04:14.550> anyone<00:04:15.000> while<00:04:15.180> you're<00:04:15.360> doing<00:04:15.420> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.990 

so<00:04:19.440> they've<00:04:19.590> actually<00:04:19.709> had<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.100> psychologist

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
so they've actually had a psychologist

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.700 
so they've actually had a psychologist
involved<00:04:21.780> in<00:04:21.900> making<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.260> game<00:04:22.440> as<00:04:22.590> well

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
involved in making this game as well

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.770 
involved in making this game as well
like<00:04:23.040> how<00:04:23.460> people<00:04:23.490> behave<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.510> how<00:04:24.570> they

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
like how people behave and how they

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.720 
like how people behave and how they
would<00:04:24.960> behave<00:04:25.110> when<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.560> usual<00:04:26.040> laws<00:04:26.340> and

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
would behave when the usual laws and

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.700 
would behave when the usual laws and
structures<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.540> society<00:04:27.690> are<00:04:28.050> completely

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
structures of society are completely

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.379 
structures of society are completely
gone<00:04:28.760> psychology<00:04:29.760> really<00:04:30.000> comes<00:04:30.180> down<00:04:30.300> to

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
gone psychology really comes down to

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.270 
gone psychology really comes down to
stuff<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:30.720> tactical<00:04:31.260> assessment<00:04:31.470> when<00:04:32.070> John

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
stuff like tactical assessment when John

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.890 
stuff like tactical assessment when John
and<00:04:32.310> Ellie<00:04:32.610> basically<00:04:33.000> encounter<00:04:33.690> a
