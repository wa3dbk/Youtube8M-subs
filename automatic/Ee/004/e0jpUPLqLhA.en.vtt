00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
well people always say to me you know
there's<00:00:19.520> extraterrestrials<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:20.910> there's

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
there's extraterrestrials and if there's

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.759 
there's extraterrestrials and if there's
UFOs<00:00:21.630> why<00:00:21.960> don't<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.350> make<00:00:22.560> themselves

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
UFOs why don't they make themselves

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.320 
UFOs why don't they make themselves
known<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.369> us<00:00:23.760> publicly<00:00:24.980> well<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.670> with
