00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
it's a little bit different I keep

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.430 
it's a little bit different I keep
picking<00:03:49.060> different<00:03:49.540> flavors<00:03:50.019> out<00:03:50.109> it's<00:03:50.319> an

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
picking different flavors out it's an

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.990 
picking different flavors out it's an

so<00:03:52.180> much<00:03:52.359> broke<00:03:52.900> me<00:03:53.109> up<00:03:53.230> at<00:03:53.350> this<00:03:53.470> one<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.859> I'm

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
so much broke me up at this one and I'm

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.410 
so much broke me up at this one and I'm
sorry<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.340> didn't<00:03:54.579> get<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.790> done<00:03:54.940> sooner<00:03:55.269> I

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
sorry I didn't get it done sooner I

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.690 
sorry I didn't get it done sooner I
really<00:03:55.720> am<00:03:55.840> it's<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.139> fantastic<00:03:57.010> beer<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.670> I

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
really am it's a fantastic beer so I

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.309 
really am it's a fantastic beer so I
think<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.000> question<00:03:58.389> remains<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.109> better

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
think the question remains is it better

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.860 
think the question remains is it better
than<00:03:59.470> goose<00:03:59.980> island's<00:04:00.519> King<00:04:00.760> Henry<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.359> think

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
than goose island's King Henry I think

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.599 
than goose island's King Henry I think
you<00:04:02.019> know<00:04:02.139> when<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.410> get<00:04:02.560> two<00:04:02.739> beers<00:04:03.069> at<00:04:03.250> this

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
you know when you get two beers at this

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.240 
you know when you get two beers at this
level<00:04:03.850> that<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.450> know<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.829> you're<00:04:05.829> nitpicking

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
level that you know it you're nitpicking

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.550 
level that you know it you're nitpicking
basically<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.000> think<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.450> good<00:04:07.870> maybe<00:04:08.470> a

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
basically I think it is good maybe a

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.830 
basically I think it is good maybe a
touch<00:04:08.950> better<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:10.030> definitely<00:04:10.359> has<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> little

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
touch better it definitely has a little

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.360 
touch better it definitely has a little
bit<00:04:11.019> more<00:04:11.109> complexity<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.889> than<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.130> think

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
bit more complexity to it than I think

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.069 
bit more complexity to it than I think
King<00:04:12.549> Henry<00:04:12.880> did<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:13.239> with<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.569> said<00:04:13.840> getting

King Henry did so with that said getting
