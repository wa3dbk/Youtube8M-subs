00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
year I definitely was able to make an

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.260 
year I definitely was able to make an
impact<00:03:02.680> don't<00:03:02.920> know<00:03:03.070> why<00:03:03.790> are<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.090> gonna

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
impact don't know why are you gonna

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.660
