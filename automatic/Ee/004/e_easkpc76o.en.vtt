kind<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.390> got<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.599> try<00:01:29.780> them<00:01:29.840> out<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.229> don't<00:01:30.890> use

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
kind of got to try them out I don't use

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.800 
kind of got to try them out I don't use
them<00:01:31.160> for<00:01:31.340> stamping<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:31.910> suppose<00:01:32.599> if<00:01:32.690> you

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
them for stamping I suppose if you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.080 
them for stamping I suppose if you
personally<00:01:33.500> really<00:01:33.979> liked<00:01:34.220> very<00:01:34.729> small

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
personally really liked very small

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.660 
personally really liked very small
detail<00:01:35.569> images<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.380> would<00:01:36.530> want<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:37.490> one

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
detail images you would want on this one

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.219 
detail images you would want on this one
because<00:01:37.970> you've<00:01:38.119> got<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.450> really<00:01:38.599> fine<00:01:38.929> end

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
because you've got the really fine end

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.820 
because you've got the really fine end
but<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:39.920> don't<00:01:40.759> use<00:01:40.910> them<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:42.110> just<00:01:42.470> these<00:01:42.770> are

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
but I don't use them and just these are

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.350 
but I don't use them and just these are
the<00:01:43.099> most<00:01:43.220> expensive<00:01:43.399> as<00:01:43.819> well<00:01:43.940> these<00:01:44.090> hold

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the most expensive as well these hold

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.339 
the most expensive as well these hold
the<00:01:44.479> most<00:01:44.800> ink<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:47.239> you<00:01:47.390> know<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.750> then

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
the most ink so just you know and then

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.410 
the most ink so just you know and then
the<00:01:48.739> next<00:01:48.979> one<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.610> sketch<00:01:49.849> markers<00:01:50.239> these

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the next one is the sketch markers these

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.139 
the next one is the sketch markers these
are<00:01:50.569> the<00:01:50.660> oval-shaped<00:01:50.989> ones<00:01:51.759> these<00:01:52.759> ones<00:01:53.000> have

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
are the oval-shaped ones these ones have

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.199 
are the oval-shaped ones these ones have
different<00:01:53.509> names<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.899> has<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.530> super<00:01:55.250> brush<00:01:55.670> nib

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
different names it has a super brush nib

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.880 
different names it has a super brush nib
on<00:01:56.800> one<00:01:57.800> end<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:59.300> chisel<00:01:59.810> nib<00:02:00.380> on<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.739> other

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
on one end and a chisel nib on the other

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.749 
on one end and a chisel nib on the other
this<00:02:01.610> chisel<00:02:02.149> is<00:02:02.330> slightly<00:02:02.869> smaller<00:02:03.050> than<00:02:03.759> the

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
this chisel is slightly smaller than the

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.260 
this chisel is slightly smaller than the
original<00:02:05.270> one<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.399> you<00:02:07.399> can<00:02:07.520> see<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.880> top<00:02:08.090> one

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
original one so you can see the top one

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.270 
original one so you can see the top one
as<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> sketch<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.959> bottom<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.739> original

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
as a sketch the bottom is the original

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.010 
as a sketch the bottom is the original
so<00:02:10.640> there<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.510> difference<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.680> size<00:02:12.980> there

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
so there is a difference in size there

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.960 
so there is a difference in size there
for<00:02:15.020> me<00:02:15.110> personally<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:16.099> like<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
for me personally I really like the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.720 
for me personally I really like the
sketch<00:02:17.209> markers<00:02:17.890> again<00:02:18.890> both<00:02:19.340> times<00:02:19.580> are

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
sketch markers again both times are

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.220 
sketch markers again both times are
coloured<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:20.300> got<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.569> number<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.080> name

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
coloured it's got the number in the name

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.290 
coloured it's got the number in the name
of<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.440> color<00:02:21.670> these<00:02:22.670> ones<00:02:22.880> hold<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.180> good

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
of the color these ones hold a good

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.119 
of the color these ones hold a good
amount<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.630> ink<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
amount of ink and

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.429 
amount of ink and
they're<00:02:25.609> great<00:02:25.790> markers<00:02:26.150> last<00:02:26.989> but<00:02:27.170> not<00:02:27.230> least

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
they're great markers last but not least

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.770 
they're great markers last but not least
at<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.709> Chow<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.879> is<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.209> smallest<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.719> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
at the Chow this is the smallest of the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.009 
at the Chow this is the smallest of the
three<00:02:30.489> them<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.639> has<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.939> exact<00:02:32.209> same<00:02:32.239> nibs<00:02:32.780> as

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
three them it has the exact same nibs as

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.839 
three them it has the exact same nibs as

the sketch markers the Chow and sketch

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.819 
the sketch markers the Chow and sketch
are<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.120> same<00:02:35.269> thing<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:36.139> got<00:02:36.260> super<00:02:36.469> brush

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
these ones it just has coloured lids

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.440 
these ones it just has coloured lids
there's<00:02:45.260> no<00:02:45.469> name<00:02:45.680> on<00:02:45.709> them<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.819> name<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.239> on

there's no name on them the name is on
the<00:02:47.959> side<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.349> marker<00:02:48.730> these<00:02:49.730> ones<00:02:49.909> are

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
the side of the marker these ones are

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.759 
the side of the marker these ones are
actually<00:02:50.180> when<00:02:50.810> they<00:02:50.989> were<00:02:51.049> first<00:02:51.469> developed

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
actually when they were first developed

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.740 
actually when they were first developed
originally<00:02:52.099> or<00:02:52.519> meant<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:52.969> children<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.629> is

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
originally or meant for children that is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.300 
originally or meant for children that is
why<00:02:53.900> there<00:02:54.079> is<00:02:54.109> no<00:02:54.200> name<00:02:54.499> on<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.769> ends<00:02:55.069> they're

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
why there is no name on the ends they're

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.679 
why there is no name on the ends they're
actually<00:02:55.909> holes<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.719> ends<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:58.689> lids

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
actually holes on the ends of the lids

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.890 
actually holes on the ends of the lids
because<00:02:59.989> if<00:03:00.530> someone<00:03:00.889> swallows<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:02.569> holes

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
because if someone swallows it the holes

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.929 
because if someone swallows it the holes
allow<00:03:03.409> air<00:03:03.829> to<00:03:03.859> pass<00:03:04.129> through<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.669> they<00:03:04.760> don't

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
allow air to pass through so they don't

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.369 
allow air to pass through so they don't
choke

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
choke

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.159 
choke
however<00:03:07.129> they<00:03:07.280> become<00:03:07.609> super<00:03:08.329> popular<00:03:08.510> with

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
however they become super popular with

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.020 
however they become super popular with
all<00:03:09.409> F<00:03:09.590> stampers<00:03:10.069> like<00:03:10.280> Copic<00:03:10.609> markers<00:03:10.909> in

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
all F stampers like Copic markers in

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.020 
all F stampers like Copic markers in
general<00:03:11.359> have<00:03:11.510> become<00:03:11.629> super<00:03:12.079> popular<00:03:13.030> so

when<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.239> talk<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.930> people<00:03:15.139> and<00:03:15.590> beginners

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
when I talk to people and beginners

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.309 
when I talk to people and beginners
asking<00:03:16.669> where<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.879> start<00:03:17.060> out<00:03:17.239> start<00:03:18.139> it<00:03:18.199> with

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
asking where to start out start it with

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.280 
asking where to start out start it with
the<00:03:18.409> child<00:03:18.590> they<00:03:18.949> are<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.219> cheapest<00:03:19.639> by<00:03:19.790> far

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
the child they are the cheapest by far

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.379 
the child they are the cheapest by far
of<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.439> three<00:03:21.799> they<00:03:22.370> work<00:03:22.579> great<00:03:22.730> they<00:03:23.090> last

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
of the three they work great they last

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.569 
of the three they work great they last
like<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> long<00:03:24.049> time<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.859> only<00:03:25.069> difference<00:03:25.430> is

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
like a long time the only difference is

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.059 
like a long time the only difference is
just<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.939> size<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.569> they<00:03:27.049> hold<00:03:27.319> less<00:03:27.739> ink

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
just the size and they hold less ink

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.909 
just the size and they hold less ink
than<00:03:28.969> the<00:03:29.209> sketch<00:03:29.449> markers<00:03:29.750> that's<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.680> only

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
than the sketch markers that's the only

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.140 
than the sketch markers that's the only
difference<00:03:31.040> they're<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.489> exact<00:03:31.699> same<00:03:31.729> nibs

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
difference they're the exact same nibs

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.679 
difference they're the exact same nibs
same<00:03:32.629> colors<00:03:33.049> um<00:03:33.849> everything

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
same colors um everything

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.439 
same colors um everything
the<00:03:36.290> only<00:03:36.439> difference<00:03:36.859> later<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:38.030> if<00:03:38.239> you

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
the only difference later on is if you

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.420 
the only difference later on is if you
get<00:03:38.629> all<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.139> ciao<00:03:39.379> markers<00:03:39.650> sketch<00:03:40.159> has

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
get all of the ciao markers sketch has

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.059 
get all of the ciao markers sketch has
the<00:03:40.609> most<00:03:40.729> colors<00:03:41.209> there's<00:03:41.540> 320<00:03:42.379> -<00:03:42.799> I<00:03:42.829> think

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
the most colors there's 320 - I think

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.550 
the most colors there's 320 - I think
colors<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.579> sketch<00:03:43.849> or<00:03:44.629> more<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.379> there's

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
colors and sketch or more and there's

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.899 
colors and sketch or more and there's
only<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.859> think<00:03:46.329> 144<00:03:47.329> ciao<00:03:48.079> colors<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.009> then

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
only I think 144 ciao colors and then

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.289 
only I think 144 ciao colors and then
same<00:03:50.239> with<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.509> original<00:03:50.900> there's<00:03:51.109> only<00:03:52.299> 214

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
same with the original there's only 214

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.710 
same with the original there's only 214
colors<00:03:53.859> um<00:03:54.859> so<00:03:55.729> yeah<00:03:55.849> if<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.150> do<00:03:56.359> eventually

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
colors um so yeah if you do eventually

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.479 
colors um so yeah if you do eventually
get<00:03:57.049> like<00:03:57.379> all<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.739> them<00:03:57.919> then<00:03:58.159> you<00:03:58.310> would

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
get like all of them then you would

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.890 
get like all of them then you would
start<00:03:58.790> getting<00:03:58.879> sketch<00:03:59.299> markers<00:03:59.509> and<00:03:59.750> that's

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
start getting sketch markers and that's

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.110 
start getting sketch markers and that's
what<00:03:59.989> I've<00:04:00.109> done<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.500> started<00:04:01.430> off<00:04:01.579> with<00:04:01.909> the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
what I've done I started off with the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.319 
what I've done I started off with the
full<00:04:02.329> set<00:04:02.629> of<00:04:02.659> Chows<00:04:03.049> they<00:04:03.439> were<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:04.329> Mother's

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
full set of Chows they were a Mother's

you're beginning just starting out on

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.710 
you're beginning just starting out on
the<00:05:23.580> Chou's<00:05:23.820> would<00:05:24.030> easiest<00:05:24.360> because<00:05:24.419> of<00:05:24.630> the

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
the Chou's would easiest because of the

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.930 
the Chou's would easiest because of the
easiest<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.110> hold<00:05:25.350> just<00:05:26.100> around<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.699> smaller

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
easiest to hold just around and smaller

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.960 
easiest to hold just around and smaller
shape<00:05:27.270> that's<00:05:27.570> I<00:05:27.900> like<00:05:28.680> them<00:05:28.889> for<00:05:29.010> that<00:05:29.160> the

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
shape that's I like them for that the

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.250 
shape that's I like them for that the
sketch<00:05:30.210> took<00:05:30.449> a<00:05:30.539> little<00:05:30.660> more<00:05:30.780> getting<00:05:31.080> used

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
sketch took a little more getting used

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.659 
sketch took a little more getting used
to<00:05:31.350> because<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.860> oval<00:05:32.130> shape<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.490> they're<00:05:32.639> a

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
to because the oval shape and they're a

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.670 
to because the oval shape and they're a
little<00:05:32.820> bit<00:05:33.030> wider<00:05:33.240> but<00:05:34.050> once<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.350> have<00:05:34.530> them

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
little bit wider but once I have them

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.050 
little bit wider but once I have them
for<00:05:34.710> Lily<00:05:34.979> I<00:05:35.130> don't<00:05:35.430> even<00:05:35.520> notice<00:05:35.789> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
for Lily I don't even notice the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.430 
for Lily I don't even notice the
difference<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.539> I'm<00:05:36.630> interchanging<00:05:37.289> them

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
difference and I'm interchanging them

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.890 
difference and I'm interchanging them
and<00:05:37.710> using<00:05:38.130> them<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.370> doesn't<00:05:38.550> matter<00:05:38.900> and

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
and using them it doesn't matter and

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.659 
and using them it doesn't matter and
another<00:05:40.169> little<00:05:40.350> park<00:05:40.680> with<00:05:40.860> sketch<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.490> that

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
another little park with sketch is that

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:42.980 
another little park with sketch is that
