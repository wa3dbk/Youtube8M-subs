00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.630 
me do you think the level 5 perk is
overpowered<00:04:21.680> because<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:22.070> definitely<00:04:22.520> think

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
overpowered because I definitely think

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.710

it's<00:04:22.820> overpowered<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.479> it<00:04:23.599> might<00:04:23.750> get<00:04:23.960> nerfed

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
it's overpowered and it might get nerfed

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.210 
it's overpowered and it might get nerfed
because<00:04:24.930> everyone<00:04:25.350> who<00:04:25.470> gets<00:04:25.590> matched<00:04:25.890> up

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
because everyone who gets matched up

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.250 
because everyone who gets matched up
