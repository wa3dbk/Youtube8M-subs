00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.639
 Today in our kitchen are very tasty 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.970
 same time very simple baked recipe 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.770
 chickens in the dough will not hide that on 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.090
 the cooking of this dish inspired me 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.140
 jamie oliver recipe 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.450
 but I was outraged that his recipe 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.220
 the dough stretched because it burned 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.350
 and was only available for use 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.110
 chicken we a little bit 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.020
 daubed this case twisted and in 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.390
 As a result, we have a tasty bread too. 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.370
 and tasty chicken but how are we all 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.730
 combined as we all did but 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.649
 look further so let's get started 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.960
 chicken marinade is nothing special 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.610
 take the most banal mix of peppers is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.420
 maybe red black salt 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.540
 Provencal herbs and for example Korea also 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.760
 add vegetable oil to the chicken and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.430
 teaspoon of vinegar or you can 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.890
 replace vinegar with sour cream or mayonnaise 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.570
 it would be nice to let the chicken lie down and 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.460
 marinated she lives are such 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.549
 moments when you come hungry and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.860
 tired angry and time to lie down from 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.720
 just not enough so chicken now 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.900
 from right half an hour into the oven for what 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.979
 half an hour later, you learn a little here 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.260
 and let him bake but while the hen is sitting in 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.750
 the oven will cook 1 come to mind 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.720
 the dough in our case is semi shortbread 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.470
 semi yeast on sour cream with margarine 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.689
 everything is as it should be on diet as a doctor 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.470
 I have already registered 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.010
 to cook 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.520
 what do you like that is in our case 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.830
 it is not essential that it be 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.049
 this bread variant roll out and 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.150
 such a big damn dough thickness is 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.890
 about half a centimeter why 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.240
 big yes because we are this pancake we 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.580
 completely confused chicken 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.420
 she will have us you product fur coat it 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.200
 magic 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.630
 species 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.460
 troubles this is our chicken she is on stage 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.320
 half-ready just started 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.310
 lower links slightly 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.009
 brown 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.929
 this state is exactly the same for us and 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.950
 need now try quick and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:27.500
 transfer to the dough wrap with there i'm brother 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:29.920
 send the oven well or appetizing 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.489
 crusts as a colleague advised me here 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.370
 we can dough fat that banned chicken 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.370
 let's see what we have here 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.370
 happened 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.950
 the essence is generally understandable we have turned 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.180
 wonderful 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.910
 tender chicken and soaked with juice 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.470
 chicken bread as I mentioned earlier on 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.239
 we send the first on such chicken in 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.489
 son's oven just half an hour after 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.380
 we get this we wrap the dough I want 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.599
 in the oven kika to readiness 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.359
 this moment is needed to 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.420
 combine the moment of making dough and 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.590
 the moment of cooking chicken here 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.829
 at the same time that they eat 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.139
 all at the same time but what we have 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.989
 it turns out we have a great 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:18.109
 juicy soft chicken of course without 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.109
 crisp brown as many as possible 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.600
 builds but nevertheless the same time 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.250
 we get in moderation magnificent in 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.950
 depending on the child which will 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.489
 use faith lush bread he 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.260
 soaked with chicken juice it's just such 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.450
 a bolt of nasal aromatic crumb of bread 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.209
 beyond words. 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.459
