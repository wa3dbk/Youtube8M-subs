my orchids on top of the ivy so really
the<00:02:57.700> foliage<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.270> used<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.959> sort<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.290> bump

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
the foliage is used just to sort of bump

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.229 
the foliage is used just to sort of bump
up<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> flowers<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> little<00:03:00.850> bit<00:03:01.120> because

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
up the flowers a little bit because

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.699 
up the flowers a little bit because
obviously<00:03:01.480> if<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.900> foliage<00:03:02.200> wasn't<00:03:02.530> there

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
obviously if the foliage wasn't there

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.710 
obviously if the foliage wasn't there
the<00:03:03.130> flowers<00:03:03.489> would<00:03:03.580> be<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.760> lot<00:03:04.090> more<00:03:04.239> compact

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the flowers would be a lot more compact

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.870 
the flowers would be a lot more compact
so<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.620> fact<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:05.890> we're<00:03:06.070> adding<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.459> foliage

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
so the fact that we're adding in foliage

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.640 
so the fact that we're adding in foliage
just<00:03:07.090> gives<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.660> little<00:03:08.050> bit<00:03:08.170> more<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
just gives it a little bit more of a

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.250 
just gives it a little bit more of a
looser<00:03:09.070> feel<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.690> orchids<00:03:10.959> on

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
looser feel to it so the orchids on

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
looser feel to it so the orchids on
head-to-head<00:03:11.800> they've<00:03:12.580> got<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> little<00:03:12.880> bit<00:03:13.000> of

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
together and pin them so the length of

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.140 
together and pin them so the length of
the<00:04:00.960> stem<00:04:01.230> should<00:04:01.260> be<00:04:01.740> cut<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.280> about<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> hand

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.450 
the stem should be cut to about a hand
and<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.420> half<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:04.020> length<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.680> they're<00:04:05.160> not<00:04:05.250> too

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460
