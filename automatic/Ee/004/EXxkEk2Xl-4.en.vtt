 welcome today we are of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.250
 I come back with quite a lot of encouragement 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 I must say it after a couple of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.769
 full rest day holiday 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320
 family and others you will know everything 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.220
 this type go of coexistence that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 usually perform during these dates 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 important for most of the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.099
 people so go have had an end 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.590
 pretty disconnected 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.660
 away from this world go to say it 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.610
 in a certain way I mean that I have not 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.590
 been recording videos I have not been neither 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.380
 even playing, much less worth 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.600
 I've even been home so go 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.550
 I owe enough videos for along 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.160
 all this week that we started but 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 good guys the new one let's start 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.620
 informing them a little about the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.710
 news of how is it 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.969
 currently the situation directly 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.039
 with plants against zombies to what I 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.129
 I mean and specifically we are talking 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.960
 about the weekly challenges that 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.730
 we had already programmed for the month of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 may remember that I had already done 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.379
 a video out there talking about them 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 of what they were going to be and how they were going to 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.579
 be developing throughout 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 of May and well seeing a little bit already 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.840
 dates it is obvious that the first 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.509
 week of the month of May has ended with 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.119
 this the first challenge as it has 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.979
 culminated worth and well throughout this 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.929
 weekend were also published 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.319
 and the results obtained 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.209
 amounts achieved through work 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.560
 of the whole community so I give it 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.869
 guys in this video I'm going to talk to you 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.359
 this is worth about what were the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.030
 results obtained and also what 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.429
 were the awards received by part 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.079
 of top cam not so let's see guys 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.310
 for those who will remember a 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.590
 little bit getting into the subject 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 will specifically remember what the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.030
 challenge the first week in what 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.030
 it consisted then I remember it very 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.079
 it was quickly the first one was to defeat 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.689
 to 5 million is worth with certain characters 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.849
 already certain vale I do not remember very 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.500
 well what were they but among those who 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:05.189
 they had selected should be defeated 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.229
 first 5 million go from 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.289
 characters or plants or zombies 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.780
 enemy and the second challenge the second 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.240
 part of this same challenge were 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.700
 it's millions for which boy I can 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.940
 go ahead that the challenge has been 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.680
 completed in its entirety and good for 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.390
 it itself within the game within the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.790
 Plants menu against zombies garden 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.100
 warfare a new one has been added 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.980
 transition is worth a new transition the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.200
 which is it basically basically sums us up 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.810
 quite clearly what were the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.020
 results obtained so I think that 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.610
 you have already seen it in the x menu as well as 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.620
 I have not had the opportunity to be 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.450
 very aware of all this during the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.209
 weekend maybe this morning in 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.680
 how much they manage to enter their game is to give 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.230
 account of the same thing that I'm going to 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.440
 practice now not so well the new 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.600
 transition says more or less like this 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.790
 results of flashes of the past 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.709
 your knowledge of the past 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.610
 they helped with the flashes of it and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.459
 defeat 10.5 million players 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.300
 to win an envelope of the zombie doctor 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.569
 vengeful and one ultra weird ok guys there 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.010
 they have it and they listened to the amounts 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.370
 they have achieved more 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.500
 of 10 million more than the second goal what 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.900
 which was incredible since with this 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.970
 they have brought us our pair of sachets 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.890
 because we had already committed 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.560
 you will remember that the awards were 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.180
 an envelope of the vengeful zombie doctor 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.909
 and one of the packet and a packet of 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.409
 ultra rare to be worth so then without more 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.030
 guys is what we have for the day of 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.890
 today is the first novelty with the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.870
 which I found this morning at 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.970
 connect me to play plants against 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.950
 zombies and well quickly we are going to open 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.190
 each of these already to finalize this 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.159
 small video like that of information not 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.260
 back to what is the subject of plants 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.639
 against zombies as well as soy guys what 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.069
 is what this has for me on the day of 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:02.159
 today we are going to see that it also comes 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.650
 loaded this envelope is therefore worth 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.750
 here we start with a couple with a couple of 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.239
 gun looks we have the chrome 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.569
 for him I think he's the painter engineer 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.389
 if I'm not wrong and I'm going to see this magma 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.150
 It's pretty good Luce looks very 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.130
 father the age like that an air to what 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.320
 is the paleontologist you will remember 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.900
 go is very very father 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.910
 so we have the zombie every cube and 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 several consumables and enough 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.480
 consumables I would say and it comes vital 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.210
 we're around here with a couple of grooves 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.320

 It was not that bad 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.280
 this is this I think it's worth it 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.200
 and also pair of stars I think that 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.360

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.520

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.090

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.540
 We have diamond metal mouth wow 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.520
 see that looks pretty father I think 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.370

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.800
 departures and we have here head venous 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.180
 of diamond is worth it really I'm not 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.310
 very sure that things are like a 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.190
 kind of crown a species like of 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.980
 crest in the carnivore that now looks 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.990
