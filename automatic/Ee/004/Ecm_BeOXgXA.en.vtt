00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.950
 management school and very particular that starting from the concept of 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 open suse to created a new bike to teach managers in ways to have 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.929
 success the numbers of this school are quite indicative because 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:25.199
 most companies more or less mediation around 90% of those that 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.659
 attended the school courses at a double-digit increase at least 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.940
 your turnover 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.710
 roberta marini the trick the key to how you do what you have that 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.600
 you have extra gear 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.430
 the trick is that the master msi those who rise to the chair of this 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.280
 school are the entrepreneurs themselves 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 padovanet this part the world has changed enough we have not thought that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.970
 the training the advice done in a classic way nothing happens 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.809
 and then we did a school of dyslexia 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.700
 entrepreneurs for the entrepreneur 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.980
 this school entrepreneurs teach entrepreneur friends is what 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.830
 maybe even on the first month they had successful lessons to win on 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.610
 market this is the first advantage to 97 working together studying together 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.980
 he entrepreneur causes the story because even if someone has a bit of 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.590
 difficulty perhaps sees that 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.910
 mate the friend entrepreneur in the field still manages to win then 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.330
 believe it and then you understand that in reality the crisis is sometimes just our mind 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.799
 here is the crisis according to what they know 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.240
 hey those who are the cornerstones of your school actually here 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.080
 such an occasion 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.020
 all the greatest riches throughout history have been made into a 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 period like this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.350
 in this period that gets back into the game a bit of a big market yes 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.160
 they distribute the cards and therefore they can get us big space 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.730
 opportunity and pro to do this you need to have in the open mind is a 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.050
 positive attitude and frequenting people who work in the same fashion 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.550
 year 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.590
