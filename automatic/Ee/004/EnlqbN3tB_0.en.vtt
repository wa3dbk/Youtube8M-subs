00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.790
 Hello friends, I do not rush 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 and you watch my video blog I think rarely 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.120
 met in the amateur gym 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 pitching room who would responsibly 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 engaged his trapeze mind 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.250
 body builder lover trapeze we 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.110
 will shield them with biceps chest and press and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 vain trapezoid no less prominent muscles 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.180
 than gizmos what went 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.200
 so how do you swing powerful 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.630
 trapezius muscles 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.580
 I'll tell you right away with the usual steps with the barbell 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 can not do here 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.689
 a little before nomic features of muscle 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.220
 trapezium is located on the back and 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.369
 are divided into and functionally 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.250
 separate areas up the middle and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.280
 the bottom of the trapezoid therefore train should 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.080
 purposefully each area the middle 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.110
 trapezoid shakes directly when 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.030
 performing the slope of the bottom of the trapezoid 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 train when you lift weight over 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.970
 head when doing shoulder presses 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.159
 but you train the top of the trapezes with their horns 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.470
 there is a whole family first 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.140
 exercise for trapezium muscle rod 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.530
 to the chin the main purpose of the exercise 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.780
 separate the muscles trapezoid hotel focus on 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.440
 medium delta plus up and middle 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.130
 trapeze the next exercise scars with 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.769
 barbell 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.989
 exercise goal upper muscle 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.569
 trapezoid which responds well to 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.500
 load and growing rapidly especially 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.930
 derrskih width 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.290
 which is visually manifested in the form of powerful 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.560
 neck and distinctly bulging top of the back on 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 The background of powerful glue is very much underlines. 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.799
 athleticism of a figure 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.110
 no rotational movements of the shoulders and 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.650
 head while driving it is fraught 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.650
 injuries 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.280
 the next type of exercise is shrugs 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.690
 these are scars with dumbbells for trapezium muscles 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.880
 lifts up and the middle of the trapezoid 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.530
 scars with dumbbells compared to 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.080
 barbell allows much deeper 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.060
 work up the trapezoid the higher 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.160
 lift your shoulders the shrinking 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.210
 upper trapezium muscles and levatorial 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.490
 muscle blade 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.770
 which will lead to a set of muscle mass 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:22.760
 use hard places well donâ€™t sacrifice 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:24.710
 so weave oh how shawn ray says well 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.130
 developed trapezoidal need for 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.040
 to visually connect the rear deltas 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.290
 the broadest spins a single powerful whole from 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.840
 powerful trapezium especially wins by 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.000
 for double biceps behind here for these 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.000
 muscles as they say the final word 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.260
 the next exercise on the bottom of the trapezoid 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.260
 angle dilution dumbbell in the slope 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.120
 bench press push and lift chest 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.840
 exercises for the upper trapezoid 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.460
 but they indirectly load and bottom of the trapezium 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.640
 the reason is that they are together 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.530
 participate in one anatomical function 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.840
 any weight lift above the head is 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.650
 blades rotate from here and turn on 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.650
 desa trapezium
