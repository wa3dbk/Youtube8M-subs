 let's remember the words of the one who died in 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.860
 the cross because in such a way he loved God at 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.270
 world that sent his only begotten son to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.940

 he reminded the pastor of laughter 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.630
 I 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.080
 well let's see what it says after the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.080
 storm 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.590
 Alejandra Hi Pastor Jorge How are you 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.680
 Well look, I really perceived a 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.080
 gigantic change compared to your 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.090
 previous presentation in the first 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.370
 round I loved you seduced me this 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.190
 totally with your work in the second 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.620
 I got discouraged a bit because I felt it was 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.140
 more of the same and we let you know or 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.510
 I at least told you today I feel 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.370
 that you recover that comedy that 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.780
 you managed to recreate a scenario that your 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.660
 sounds were very successful that 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.810
 you really managed to transport us to that 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.380
 part of the bible and create that story 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.880
 in a clear direct fun way what 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.390
 only I would tell you to have it in 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.270
 account do not worry so much if you do a 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.310
 little more slowly your sounds are not 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.590
 they lose and there are very good shots that the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.990
 you do that suddenly happen because no 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.350
 He is so attentive and they are like so 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.630
 if so euphoric that they manage to dilute 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.490
 then it would be worth it to lower it 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.680
 a little bit the revolutions but I 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.110
 like the euphoria with which you came out 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.790
 energy you knew that this was your last 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.790
 opportunity you had it very clear 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.610
 Amen Amen amen and I loved the shirt 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.610
 of super super j 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.280
 you recover the passion that had 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.280
 conquered in the beginning 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:29.349
 you grew a lot in this third round 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.810
 I think you went out to give everything and that's 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.189
 what to do every time we go 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.729
 moving forward in the program so 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.729
 Congratulations 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.659
 good shepherd we are on the right path 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.270
 I see you well I was also a little 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:50.210
 worried because because if it happened to me 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.650
 exactly the same the last time we 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.089
 you brought what we did back from the 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.979
 audition not so good but I knew that 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:00.259
 you had this ability if you rode it 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.629
 it's good to be surprised in this round what 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.779
 have you done I totally agree 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.059
 with Alejandra I think that the only thing 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.559
 you must do is lower the tone so that 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.400
 do not be so shouted all down the 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.289
 euphoria 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.729
 breathe a little bit that is a little more 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.520
 slowly I know that you have the desire of the 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.589
 two minutes but but sometimes less is 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.009
 more to the extent that it is clear and 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:24.110
 reach your message if you pass to 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.199
 the next round I want to see 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.210
 something a little more elaborate more character 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:33.520
 it's more sophisticated but if this is the 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.520
 path that you will take more very well 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.460
 take advantage is a message from all my 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.080
 brothers in front of colombia let's go 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.710

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.150
