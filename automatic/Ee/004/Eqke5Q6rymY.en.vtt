was a pretty simple example but the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.180 
was a pretty simple example but the

weapon<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.630> we've<00:03:06.780> introduced<00:03:07.200> with<00:03:07.319> Far

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
weapon that we've introduced with Far

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.880 
weapon that we've introduced with Far
Cry<00:03:07.620> 4<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:09.150> adds<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.750> little<00:03:10.230> more<00:03:10.349> versatility

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
Cry 4 it adds a little more versatility

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.760 
Cry 4 it adds a little more versatility
than<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.580> bow<00:03:11.760> did<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.209> Far<00:03:12.390> Cry<00:03:12.510> 3<00:03:12.770> obviously

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
than the bow did in Far Cry 3 obviously

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.820 
than the bow did in Far Cry 3 obviously
it<00:03:14.069> sacrifices<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.819> long<00:03:15.060> range<00:03:15.330> for<00:03:15.830> rapid

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
it sacrifices the long range for rapid

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.130 
it sacrifices the long range for rapid
fire<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:17.730> still<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.989> super<00:03:18.989> useful

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
fire but it's still a super useful

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.290 
fire but it's still a super useful
stealth<00:03:19.620> weapon<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.209> my
