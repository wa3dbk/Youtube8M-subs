00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
allows us to determine the exact time

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.120 
allows us to determine the exact time
for<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.120> full<00:03:47.299> moon<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:48.319> minute<00:03:48.590> before<00:03:48.709> and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
for the full moon one minute before and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.400 
for the full moon one minute before and
it's<00:03:49.489> not<00:03:49.669> quite<00:03:49.910> full<00:03:50.150> one<00:03:50.959> minute<00:03:51.260> after

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
it's not quite full one minute after

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.309 
it's not quite full one minute after
it's<00:03:51.829> all<00:03:52.160> over<00:03:52.220> until<00:03:52.880> next<00:03:53.090> month<00:03:53.389> but<00:03:54.139> why

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
it's all over until next month but why

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.900 
it's all over until next month but why
is<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.500> moon<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.769> different<00:03:55.190> size<00:03:55.430> at

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
is the moon a different size at

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.050 
is the moon a different size at
different<00:03:56.389> full<00:03:56.540> moons<00:03:57.549> well<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.880> moon's

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
different full moons well the moon's

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.849 
different full moons well the moon's
path<00:03:59.359> in<00:03:59.569> its<00:03:59.690> orbit<00:03:59.900> around<00:04:00.139> the<00:04:00.440> Earth<00:04:00.590> is

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
path in its orbit around the Earth is

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.220 
path in its orbit around the Earth is
not<00:04:01.190> quite<00:04:01.549> a<00:04:01.609> circle<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.480> moon<00:04:02.630> averages

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
not quite a circle the moon averages

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.309 
not quite a circle the moon averages
about<00:04:03.940> 240,000<00:04:04.940> miles<00:04:05.090> from<00:04:05.419> Earth<00:04:05.630> but<00:04:05.900> can

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
about 240,000 miles from Earth but can

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.449 
about 240,000 miles from Earth but can
get<00:04:06.470> as<00:04:06.590> close<00:04:06.769> as<00:04:06.889> 220<00:04:08.410> 1441<00:04:09.410> miles<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.919> as

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
get as close as 220 1441 miles and as

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.190 
get as close as 220 1441 miles and as
far<00:04:10.760> as<00:04:11.049> 250<00:04:12.489> 2723<00:04:13.489> miles<00:04:13.910> that's<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.780> range<00:04:15.049> of

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
far as 250 2723 miles that's a range of

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.069 
far as 250 2723 miles that's a range of
over<00:04:15.349> 30,000<00:04:16.280> miles<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.329> full<00:04:17.630> moon<00:04:17.840> can<00:04:18.049> be

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
over 30,000 miles so a full moon can be

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.650 
over 30,000 miles so a full moon can be
very<00:04:18.500> close<00:04:18.829> such<00:04:19.519> as<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.789> one<00:04:19.940> next<00:04:20.180> week<00:04:20.389> or

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
very close such as the one next week or

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.620 
very close such as the one next week or
it<00:04:20.959> can<00:04:21.079> be<00:04:21.109> 30,000<00:04:22.039> miles<00:04:22.219> farther<00:04:22.669> away<00:04:22.969> like

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
it can be 30,000 miles farther away like

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.690 
it can be 30,000 miles farther away like
the<00:04:23.810> farthest<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.409> smallest<00:04:24.919> full<00:04:25.190> moon<00:04:25.430> for

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
the farthest and smallest full moon for

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.800 
the farthest and smallest full moon for
this<00:04:25.820> year<00:04:26.150> which<00:04:26.539> will<00:04:26.659> be

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
this year which will be

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.350 
this year which will be
in<00:04:26.870> october<00:04:27.470> eleventh<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.550> last<00:04:28.820> time<00:04:29.090> we<00:04:29.240> had

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
in october eleventh the last time we had

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.830 
in october eleventh the last time we had
a<00:04:29.389> full<00:04:29.630> moon<00:04:29.840> closer<00:04:30.169> than<00:04:30.470> this<00:04:30.650> was<00:04:31.340> March

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
a full moon closer than this was March

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.270 
a full moon closer than this was March
1993<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.410> next<00:04:33.620> time<00:04:33.889> we'll<00:04:34.100> be<00:04:34.190> in

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
1993 and the next time we'll be in

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.080 
1993 and the next time we'll be in
November<00:04:34.870> 2016<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:37.220> be<00:04:37.400> sure<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.610> check<00:04:37.760> out

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
November 2016 so be sure to check out

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.450 
November 2016 so be sure to check out
this<00:04:38.270> extremely<00:04:38.930> close<00:04:39.320> full<00:04:39.620> moon<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.100> don't

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
this extremely close full moon and don't

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.280 
this extremely close full moon and don't
miss<00:04:40.730> Jupiter<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.450> Mercury<00:04:41.630> at<00:04:41.990> their

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
miss Jupiter and Mercury at their

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.450 
miss Jupiter and Mercury at their
closest<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:42.919> remember<00:04:43.490> keep<00:04:43.820> looking<00:04:44.330> up
