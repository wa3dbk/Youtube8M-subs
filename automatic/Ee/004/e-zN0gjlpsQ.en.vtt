released today for arkham city on xbox
live<00:00:16.110> and<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.830> PSN<00:00:17.280> now<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> don't<00:00:18.300> know<00:00:18.510> how

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
live and on the PSN now I don't know how

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.470 
live and on the PSN now I don't know how
much<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.170> PSN<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.860> it's<00:00:20.190> 560<00:00:21.030> microsoft

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
much is on PSN but it's 560 microsoft

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.830 
much is on PSN but it's 560 microsoft
points<00:00:21.780> on<00:00:21.900> xbox<00:00:22.470> live<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.250> i<00:00:24.120> think<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
points on xbox live and i think that the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.710 
points on xbox live and i think that the
low<00:00:24.990> price<00:00:25.260> kind<00:00:25.530> of<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:26.160> fair<00:00:26.550> because<00:00:26.790> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
low price kind of is fair because it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.030 
low price kind of is fair because it
doesn't<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.170> add<00:00:28.350> a<00:00:28.380> whole<00:00:28.590> lot<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.950> the

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
doesn't really add a whole lot of the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.200

originally<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.589> game<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.190> don't

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
originally in the game and they don't

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.709 
originally in the game and they don't
really<00:00:56.609> change<00:00:56.850> how<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.239> play<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.569> game

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
really change how we play the game

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.599 
really change how we play the game
whereas<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.769> person<00:00:59.129> Matthew<00:00:59.339> gave<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.519> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
whereas the person Matthew gave you this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.700 
whereas the person Matthew gave you this
which<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.909> seeing<00:01:00.179> now<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.019> Wayne<00:01:01.350> Manor

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
which is seeing now is the Wayne Manor

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.270 
which is seeing now is the Wayne Manor
map<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:03.030> my<00:01:03.239> opinion<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.870> probably

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
map and in my opinion this is probably

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
map and in my opinion this is probably
one<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> best<00:01:06.390> predator<00:01:07.080> map<00:01:07.260> in

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
one of if not the best predator map in

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.410 
one of if not the best predator map in
the<00:01:07.530> game<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.850> love<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the game I really love how the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.149 
the game I really love how the
environment<00:01:09.870> feels<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:10.829> it's<00:01:10.979> like

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
environment feels and how it's like

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.480 
environment feels and how it's like
different<00:01:11.340> levels<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.509> down<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
different levels as you go up and down I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.830 
different levels as you go up and down I
think<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:14.790> good<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.270> course<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
think it's really good and of course you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
think it's really good and of course you
can<00:01:15.960> bring<00:01:16.140> Batman<00:01:16.439> Catwoman<00:01:17.329> robin<00:01:18.329> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
can bring Batman Catwoman robin and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.120 
can bring Batman Catwoman robin and
nightwing<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> scene<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:20.070> 10<00:01:20.310> months

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
nightwing as a scene here on 10 months

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
nightwing as a scene here on 10 months
it's<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.460> personally<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> prefer<00:01:24.600> plain<00:01:25.259> as

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it's now personally I prefer plain as

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.980 
it's now personally I prefer plain as
Batman<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:25.950> Catwoman<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.880> Noreen<00:01:27.329> bring<00:01:27.570> um<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
Batman and Catwoman to Noreen bring um I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.389 
Batman and Catwoman to Noreen bring um I
think<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:28.439> he<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.860> weapon

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
think it's because he has the weapon

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.010 
think it's because he has the weapon
when<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.759> fighting<00:01:29.969> I<00:01:30.299> don't<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.719> like

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
when you're fighting I don't really like

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.859 
when you're fighting I don't really like
as<00:01:31.590> much<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.610> opinion

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
as much but again that's just my opinion

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.060 
as much but again that's just my opinion
although<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.899> do<00:01:34.020> prefer<00:01:34.289> playing<00:01:34.799> as

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
although I do prefer playing as

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.749 
although I do prefer playing as
Nightwing<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:36.060> claim<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.539> Robin<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
Nightwing to claim as Robin and the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.149 
Nightwing to claim as Robin and the
Robin<00:01:39.090> DLC<00:01:39.960> map<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> again

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
Robin DLC map so you got with that again

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.709 
Robin DLC map so you got with that again
I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:41.939> they're<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.149> good<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.539> the

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
I don't think they're as good as the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.660 
I don't think they're as good as the
maps<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:45.289> now<00:01:46.289> as<00:01:46.770> far<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.159> DLC

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
maps you get with this now as far as DLC

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.740 
maps you get with this now as far as DLC
goes<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.500> think<00:01:49.500> within<00:01:50.310> Arkham<00:01:51.090> City<00:01:51.299> there's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
goes I think within Arkham City there's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.169 
goes I think within Arkham City there's
room<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.710> lot<00:01:52.950> more<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.399> mean<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.850> moment

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
room for a lot more I mean at the moment

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.760 
room for a lot more I mean at the moment
they're<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.479> bringing<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.380> combat

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
they're just bringing out the combat

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
maps and the new maps and new characters

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.630 
maps and the new maps and new characters
are<00:01:58.259> brilliant<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:58.679> imagine<00:01:59.250> being<00:01:59.429> able<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
are brilliant but imagine being able to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.980 
are brilliant but imagine being able to
take<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> new<00:02:00.210> characters<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> download

into Arkham City and play around like
that<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.600> think<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.109> would<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.590> much<00:02:04.619> better

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that I think it would be so much better

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.859 
that I think it would be so much better
and<00:02:05.429> maybe<00:02:05.759> adding<00:02:06.149> new<00:02:06.329> missions<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.810> stuff

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and maybe adding new missions and stuff

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.630 
and maybe adding new missions and stuff
