mechanism<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:07.290> episode<00:00:07.770> I'm<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> show

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
mechanism this episode I'm going to show

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.950 
mechanism this episode I'm going to show
you<00:00:08.429> guys<00:00:08.700> how<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.940> get<00:00:09.210> energy<00:00:09.389> through

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
you guys how to get energy through

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.209 
you guys how to get energy through
various<00:00:10.440> sources<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:13.259> first<00:00:13.500> way<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.950> can

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
various sources the first way you can

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.129 
various sources the first way you can
get<00:00:14.429> energy<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.969> by<00:00:15.120> using<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.540> heat<00:00:15.719> generator

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
get energy is by using a heat generator

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.220 
get energy is by using a heat generator
heat<00:00:16.830> generator<00:00:17.340> provides<00:00:17.580> heat<00:00:18.000> through<00:00:18.960> two

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
heat generator provides heat through two

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
heat generator provides heat through two
different<00:00:19.590> ways<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.980> first<00:00:20.160> way<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> through

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
different ways the first way is through

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.359 
different ways the first way is through
passed<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.869> few<00:00:21.990> generation<00:00:22.560> which<00:00:22.740> uses<00:00:23.100> lava

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
passed a few generation which uses lava

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.349 
passed a few generation which uses lava
and<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> second<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:25.099> using<00:00:26.099> coal<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.730> any

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
and the second way is using coal or any

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.859 
and the second way is using coal or any
other<00:00:27.570> vertical<00:00:27.840> fuse<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.410> fuel<00:00:28.800> sources

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
other vertical fuse or fuel sources

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.150 
other vertical fuse or fuel sources
through<00:00:30.869> passive<00:00:31.260> heat<00:00:31.410> generation<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
through passive heat generation it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.180 
through passive heat generation it
generates<00:00:32.610> five<00:00:33.570> joules<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.020> energy<00:00:34.110> per<00:00:34.770> lava

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
generates five joules of energy per lava

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
generates five joules of energy per lava
block<00:00:35.550> touching<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.590> be

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
block touching it they don't have to be

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.900 
block touching it they don't have to be
source<00:00:37.950> blocks<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.790> be

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
source blocks they just have to be

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.880 
source blocks they just have to be
around<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.230> will<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.440> producing

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
around it so this one will be producing

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
around it so this one will be producing
five<00:00:41.129> joules<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> energy<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.930> will

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
five joules of energy and this one will

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
five joules of energy and this one will
be<00:00:43.079> producing<00:00:43.620> twenty<00:00:43.920> five<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.489> all

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
be producing twenty five because all

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
be producing twenty five because all
five<00:00:44.850> sides<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:46.050> touching<00:00:46.260> lava<00:00:47.270> while<00:00:48.379> there

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
five sides are touching lava while there

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.010 
five sides are touching lava while there
is<00:00:49.590> fuel<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
is fuel and it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.310 
is fuel and it
it<00:00:51.680> produces<00:00:52.310> 150<00:00:53.030> joules<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:53.660> energy<00:00:53.930> per

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
it produces 150 joules of energy per

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.850 
it produces 150 joules of energy per
tick<00:00:54.700> so<00:00:55.700> it's<00:00:55.850> quite<00:00:56.060> a<00:00:56.120> bit<00:00:56.330> more<00:00:56.360> to<00:00:57.080> provide

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
tick so it's quite a bit more to provide

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.580 
tick so it's quite a bit more to provide
a<00:00:57.890> fuel

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
a fuel

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.610 
a fuel
next<00:01:00.250> up<00:01:00.370> we<00:01:00.489> have<00:01:00.520> solar<00:01:00.940> energy<00:01:01.440> these<00:01:02.440> are<00:01:02.469> a

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
next up we have solar energy these are a

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.210 
next up we have solar energy these are a
little<00:01:02.860> bit<00:01:02.949> harder<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.280> make<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:06.010> are

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
little bit harder to make but they are

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.190 
little bit harder to make but they are
produced<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.150> lot<00:01:07.270> more<00:01:07.450> energy<00:01:07.750> passively

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
produced a lot more energy passively

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.980 
produced a lot more energy passively
than<00:01:08.560> heat<00:01:08.860> generators<00:01:09.070> one<00:01:10.060> solar<00:01:10.330> basic

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
than heat generators one solar basic

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.219 
than heat generators one solar basic
solar<00:01:11.200> will<00:01:11.380> produce<00:01:11.560> 75<00:01:12.130> joules<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.729> energy

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
solar will produce 75 joules of energy

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.859 
solar will produce 75 joules of energy
you<00:01:14.229> just<00:01:14.440> place<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.680> on<00:01:14.950> top<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.220> a

energy<00:01:18.560> or<00:01:18.950> cable<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.000> have<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.240> make

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
energy or cable and you have to make

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.639 
energy or cable and you have to make
sure<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:20.750> it's<00:01:21.820> outside<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:23.500> guess<00:01:24.500> it

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
sure that it's outside I guess it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.899 
sure that it's outside I guess it
doesn't<00:01:24.920> actually<00:01:25.009> need<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.429> see<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.700> Sun<00:01:25.880> I

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
doesn't actually need to see the Sun I

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.499 
doesn't actually need to see the Sun I
don't<00:01:26.149> know<00:01:26.270> if<00:01:26.359> that's<00:01:26.539> a<00:01:26.630> bug<00:01:26.810> or<00:01:26.929> not<00:01:29.140> but

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
don't know if that's a bug or not but

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.080 
don't know if that's a bug or not but
it<00:01:32.509> needs<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.049> be<00:01:33.140> daylight<00:01:33.439> for<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.860> work

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.350 
tick needs to be daylight for it to work
and<00:01:53.710> I'm<00:01:54.710> pretty<00:01:54.920> sure<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.340> needs<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.850> direct

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
and I'm pretty sure it needs a direct

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.760 
and I'm pretty sure it needs a direct
path<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.869> sky<00:01:57.550> or<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.820> should<00:01:59.149> if<00:01:59.570> you<00:02:00.560> turn

path to the sky or it should if you turn
it<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.040> nighttime

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.469 

you<00:02:04.159> see<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.700> no<00:02:04.820> longer<00:02:04.850> provides

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
you see that it no longer provides

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.240 
you see that it no longer provides
energy<00:02:07.539> same<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.069> basic<00:02:10.069> solar

good way to produce energy to produce
biofuel<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.880> need<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> crusher<00:04:45.510> simply<00:04:46.440> put<00:04:47.430> a

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
biofuel you need a crusher simply put a

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.950 
biofuel you need a crusher simply put a
hopper<00:04:47.820> on<00:04:47.940> top<00:04:48.150> or<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.390> can<00:04:48.570> just<00:04:48.720> place<00:04:48.930> it

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
hopper on top or you can just place it

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.050 
hopper on top or you can just place it
strictly<00:04:49.260> into<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.680> crusher<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.580> produces

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
strictly into the crusher it produces

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.810 
strictly into the crusher it produces
biofuel<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.740> then<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.950> output<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.370> biofuel

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
biofuel and then you output the biofuel

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.020 
biofuel and then you output the biofuel
into<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.210> bio<00:04:54.360> generator<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.590> produces

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
into the bio generator and it produces

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.470 
into the bio generator and it produces
350<00:04:57.030> joules

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
350 joules
