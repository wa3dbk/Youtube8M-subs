00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.510
 we are going to kiyams just like today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.840
 spring breaks and therefore I decided 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.590
 make your next video by 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.170
 unusual such minifigures called 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.500
 I'm because of some part but you probably 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.859
 already guessed that this is the main 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.710
 a hero to him is passion foam heroes 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.859
 running a movie is clear that most of you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.360
 already watched this cartoon 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.020
 Well, I also went to the movies but slide me 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.960
 reached for another movie 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 I certainly did not like her and I was 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 then just not happy and not easy 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.590
 offended smoothly well yet I think that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.930
 and if they come across one or the other 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.420
 heroes then you write me please 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.420
 comments will not be very possible so 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.780
 say these clear 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.650
 don't even talk to you but just 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.060
 to know who they are and the general or 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.659
 like there everything I bought two non-jews 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.460
 up to just one pack costs 29 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.409
 hryvnia i think it will be more expensive in general about 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.939
 them imitated it appreciate 100 or two 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.280
