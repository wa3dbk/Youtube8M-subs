00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and you know a whole package but i think

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.450 
and you know a whole package but i think
also<00:01:39.120> that<00:01:39.290> norway<00:01:40.290> when<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> comes<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> food

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
it's more familiar to the American Way
Canadian<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.910> way<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.120> living<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.990> not
