 hello here aerox today I you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.649
 will present a little trick 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.160
 how to uninstall tweets that you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.950
 have installed 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.450
 because if you click on it it does not appear 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 no xcom in applications 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.119
 normal to install them so you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.109
 go to cydia 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.109

 good you go in handle package effect 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.250
 so then you pick the one that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.110

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.570
 long sometimes they ask to do 1 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.240
 res pring because the application 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.910
 the tweak you want to uninstall it 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.740
 modifies things on your behalf your 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.040
