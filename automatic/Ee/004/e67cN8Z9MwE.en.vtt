 zacatecoluca we do not have an exact cause

 speed and recklessness was part of 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.630
 the main invasion of the lane in 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.459
 this case that was coming if you can 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.959
 see the crash is a head-on collision and that 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.160
 has caused that the vehicle more 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.260
 small 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.060
 leave the road and obviously everyone 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.100
 those who came in and ask the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.900

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.150

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.160
 respect the rules the scene and the

 strong heat were not impediments to 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.120
 that several people mostly with children 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.550
 they will bet on the place to observe 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.010
 the incident that generated a strong 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.360
 vehicular congestion for the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.360
