I<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.230> coolest<00:01:55.590> things<00:01:55.860> about

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
I think one of the coolest things about

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.790 
I think one of the coolest things about
mojo<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.150> really<00:01:57.480> takes<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.530> car

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
mojo is the way it really takes the car

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.219 
mojo is the way it really takes the car
and<00:01:59.190> connects<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.660> rest<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.050> world

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and connects it to the rest of the world

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
and connects it to the rest of the world
it's<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.369> thing<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.880> get

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it's not just this thing that you get

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.030 
it's not just this thing that you get
into<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.440> drive<00:02:04.740> around

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
into and get out of and drive around

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.760 
into and get out of and drive around
them<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.550> rather<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.030> becomes<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.770> more

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
them but rather it becomes a more

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
them but rather it becomes a more
integral<00:02:08.280> part<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.610> your<00:02:08.670> world<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.630> really

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
integral part of your world we really

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
integral part of your world we really
want<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> enable<00:02:10.290> an<00:02:10.740> entire<00:02:11.130> ecosystem<00:02:11.880> of

want to enable an entire ecosystem of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.750 
want to enable an entire ecosystem of
developers<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.600> be<00:02:12.930> able<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.290> extend<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> make

their imagination of reality anyone can

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
write software for the Mojo we ourselves

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.400 
write software for the Mojo we ourselves
write<00:02:20.010> our<00:02:20.160> apps<00:02:20.370> using<00:02:20.790> our<00:02:20.970> own<00:02:21.180> SDK<00:02:21.810> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
write our apps using our own SDK so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.840 
write our apps using our own SDK so
there's<00:02:22.560> no<00:02:22.709> distinction<00:02:23.130> between<00:02:23.310> how<00:02:23.790> we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
there's no distinction between how we

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.310 
there's no distinction between how we
build<00:02:24.180> our<00:02:24.300> products<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.780> how<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.200> build

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
build our products and how you can build

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.230 
build our products and how you can build
products<00:02:25.709> on<00:02:25.860> top<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.220> mojo<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.760> open

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
products on top of mojo the open

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.850 
products on top of mojo the open
platform<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.840> other<00:02:27.990> people<00:02:28.350> can<00:02:28.500> build<00:02:28.680> on

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
platform that other people can build on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.250 
platform that other people can build on
top<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.370> think<00:02:29.580> will<00:02:29.760> lead<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.480> much<00:02:31.200> wider

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
top of I think will lead to a much wider

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.520 
top of I think will lead to a much wider
range<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.160> applications<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.330> make<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.050> other

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
range of applications and make the other

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.590 
range of applications and make the other
thing<00:02:34.830> we're<00:02:35.250> useful<00:02:35.730> too<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.330> end<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
thing we're useful too in the end of the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.750 
thing we're useful too in the end of the
consumer<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.500> know<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> think<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.160> really

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
consumer you know I think that really

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.340 
consumer you know I think that really
the<00:02:39.090> interesting<00:02:39.269> question<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:39.840> mojo<00:02:40.170> is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
the interesting question with mojo is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.140 
the interesting question with mojo is
what<00:02:40.590> kinds<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.010> applications<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.880> people

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
what kinds of applications of the people

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.480 
what kinds of applications of the people
develop
