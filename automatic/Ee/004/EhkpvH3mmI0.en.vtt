again using the cam arm and that should

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.510 
again using the cam arm and that should
be<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> proper<00:00:54.870> position<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> cam

put<00:01:04.019> new<00:01:04.170> hooks<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.460> keep<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.850> let's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
put new hooks in I just keep going let's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
put new hooks in I just keep going let's
try<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.750> same<00:01:06.990> thing<00:01:07.320> we'll<00:01:07.740> go<00:01:07.890> through

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
try this the same thing we'll go through

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.660 
try this the same thing we'll go through
the<00:01:08.189> steps<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.360> mid-sized<00:01:09.900> hook

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
the steps with a the mid-sized hook

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
the steps with a the mid-sized hook
first<00:01:11.670> I'll<00:01:11.850> use<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.240> jar<00:01:12.450> adjustment<00:01:12.990> screw

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
first I'll use the jar adjustment screw

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530 
first I'll use the jar adjustment screw
to<00:01:13.439> set<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> range<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.670> hook<00:01:14.909> wire<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to set the range of hook wire that the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.570 
to set the range of hook wire that the
jaw<00:01:15.780> will<00:01:15.960> accept<00:01:16.439> I'll<00:01:16.770> come<00:01:17.009> down<00:01:17.189> into<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
jaw will accept I'll come down into the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.630 
jaw will accept I'll come down into the
tying<00:01:17.880> position<00:01:18.710> tighten<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.799> using<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.310> cam

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
tying position tighten up using my cam

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.170 
tying position tighten up using my cam
arm<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.560> doesn't<00:01:22.950> come<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.369> quite<00:01:23.790> into<00:01:24.090> the

arm it doesn't come up quite into the
position<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.290> I'll<00:01:25.409> readjust<00:01:26.400> my

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
position I want it so I'll readjust my

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.780 
position I want it so I'll readjust my
adjustment<00:01:27.240> screw<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.340> we'll<00:01:29.340> tighten<00:01:29.579> up

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
adjustment screw and we'll tighten up

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520 
adjustment screw and we'll tighten up
and<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> cam<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.869> arm<00:01:30.990> comes<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.380> to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and see if the cam I arm comes up to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.539 
and see if the cam I arm comes up to
roughly<00:01:31.829> parallel<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> shaft<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.960> does<00:01:34.549> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
roughly parallel with a shaft it does so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.420 
roughly parallel with a shaft it does so
I'll<00:01:35.700> loosen<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.900> cam<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.380> make<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> final

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I'll loosen the cam I make a final

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.350 
I'll loosen the cam I make a final
adjustment<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> jar<00:01:39.360> adjustment<00:01:39.900> screw<00:01:40.259> and

adjustment on a jar adjustment screw and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.170 
adjustment on a jar adjustment screw and
tighten<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:44.369> set<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> tie

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
tighten and there we are all set to tie

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
tighten and there we are all set to tie
let's<00:01:45.630> try<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.340> larger<00:01:47.340> hook<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
let's try it with a larger hook of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
let's try it with a larger hook of
Faurot<00:01:48.119> hug<00:01:48.390> again<00:01:50.990> set<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.020> range<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.680> hook

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
Faurot hug again set the range of hook

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
Faurot hug again set the range of hook
wire<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.369> will<00:01:53.520> accept<00:01:54.049> tighten<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> cam

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
wire that will accept tighten the cam

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.889 
wire that will accept tighten the cam
arm<00:01:57.110> looks<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:59.180> it's<00:02:00.180> about<00:02:00.299> where<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> want

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
arm looks good it's about where I want

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.700 
arm looks good it's about where I want
it<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.560> I'll<00:02:01.740> loosen<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.820> jaw<00:02:03.680> make<00:02:04.680> a
