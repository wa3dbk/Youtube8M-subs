neighborhood because that's where I live
and<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.350> felt<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:03.740> actually<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.060> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
and I felt that actually like one of the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.179 
and I felt that actually like one of the
most<00:02:05.270> challenging<00:02:05.780> things<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.470> personally

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
most challenging things that personally

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.800 
most challenging things that personally
that<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.549> do<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.970> do<00:02:08.119> something<00:02:08.330> close<00:02:08.600> to

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
that I can do is do something close to

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.930 
that I can do is do something close to
me<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.110> think<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.950> find<00:02:10.250> it<00:02:10.340> quite<00:02:10.399> difficult<00:02:10.670> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
me I think I find it quite difficult to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.789 
me I think I find it quite difficult to
go<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.180> another<00:02:11.390> country<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:12.049> see<00:02:12.590> something

exotic<00:02:13.130> or<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:14.360> focus<00:02:14.840> myself<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> project

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
exotic or to focus myself on a project

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.979 
exotic or to focus myself on a project
that's<00:02:16.100> kind<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.579> you<00:02:16.760> know<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:17.690> there

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
that's kind of like you know it's there

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.990 
that's kind of like you know it's there
and<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.500> know<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.799> I<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.070> execute<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.790> whereas

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and I know that I can execute it whereas

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.340 
and I know that I can execute it whereas
with<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.570> was<00:02:20.660> kind<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.079> a<00:02:21.170> lot<00:02:21.290> more

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
with this it was kind of a lot more

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.069 
with this it was kind of a lot more
mysterious<00:02:21.829> I<00:02:22.549> knew<00:02:23.329> that<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.600> access<00:02:23.900> was

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
mysterious I knew that the access was

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.479 
mysterious I knew that the access was
going<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:24.350> incredibly<00:02:24.470> challenging<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.430> I

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
going to be incredibly challenging and I

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.610 
going to be incredibly challenging and I
knew<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.880> was<00:02:25.970> close<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.209> home<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.380> had

knew that it was close to home so I had

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.680 
knew that it was close to home so I had

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
to kind of make the banal interesting so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.570 
to kind of make the banal interesting so
is<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:30.080> people<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.770> really<00:02:31.130> that

I<00:02:34.880> mean<00:02:35.180> landscapes<00:02:35.870> are<00:02:36.020> beautiful<00:02:36.440> but<00:02:36.830> I

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
I mean landscapes are beautiful but I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.370 
I mean landscapes are beautiful but I
kind<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.240> find<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.540> there's<00:02:38.750> only<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.080> many

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
kind of find that there's only so many

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.560 
kind of find that there's only so many
factors<00:02:39.920> within<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.460> sixtieth<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.030> second

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
factors within a sixtieth of a second

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.630 
factors within a sixtieth of a second
yeah<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.530> will<00:02:42.680> alter<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.190> landscape

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
yeah that will alter that landscape

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.340 
yeah that will alter that landscape
whereas<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.030> feel<00:02:44.240> like<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> person<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.260> do

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
whereas I feel like a person can just do

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.010 
whereas I feel like a person can just do
anything<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:46.880> kind<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:47.630> that

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
anything and I kind of I like that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.690 
anything and I kind of I like that
exchange<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.620> come<00:02:48.860> from<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.340> know<00:02:49.460> I've

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
exchange and I come from you know I've

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.370 
exchange and I come from you know I've
always<00:02:50.000> had<00:02:50.120> an<00:02:50.240> interest<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.690> social<00:02:50.930> science

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380

head<00:03:34.310> over<00:03:34.340> heels<00:03:34.670> for<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.060> was

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
head over heels for it and that was

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.090 
head over heels for it and that was
really<00:03:35.480> lucky<00:03:35.660> yeah<00:03:36.050> like<00:03:36.530> not<00:03:36.709> many<00:03:36.860> people

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
really lucky yeah like not many people

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.520 
really lucky yeah like not many people
kind<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.519> just<00:03:37.760> know<00:03:38.420> ya<00:03:38.989> know<00:03:39.019> what<00:03:39.290> they<00:03:39.380> want

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
kind of just know ya know what they want

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.040 
kind of just know ya know what they want
to<00:03:39.590> do<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:40.340> guess<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.120> advice<00:03:41.269> that<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:41.959> could

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
to do so I guess the advice that I could

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.390 
to do so I guess the advice that I could
only<00:03:42.320> give<00:03:42.590> would<00:03:42.890> just<00:03:43.100> be<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:46.280> not

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
only give would just be to to not

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.490 
only give would just be to to not
isolate<00:03:46.880> yourself<00:03:47.269> like<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.870> think<00:03:48.380> that

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
isolate yourself like I think that

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.300 
isolate yourself like I think that
actually<00:03:48.650> like<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.820> majority<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:51.100> ways<00:03:52.100> in

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
actually like the majority of ways in

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.800 
actually like the majority of ways in
which<00:03:52.400> my<00:03:52.580> photography<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.120> developed<00:03:53.570> and

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
which my photography is developed and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.110 
which my photography is developed and
how<00:03:53.989> I've<00:03:54.170> grown<00:03:54.530> up<00:03:54.560> as<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.830> person<00:03:54.920> have<00:03:55.910> been

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
how I've grown up as a person have been

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.870 
how I've grown up as a person have been
down<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.630> my<00:03:56.959> influences<00:03:57.530> my<00:03:57.709> inspiration<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
down to my influences my inspiration and

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.729 
down to my influences my inspiration and
I<00:03:59.090> think<00:03:59.330> that<00:03:59.450> photography<00:03:59.989> although<00:04:00.140> it

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
I think that photography although it

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.860 
I think that photography although it
seems<00:04:01.070> like<00:04:01.160> quite<00:04:01.430> an<00:04:01.550> isolating<00:04:02.180> thing<00:04:02.390> you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
seems like quite an isolating thing you

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.030 
seems like quite an isolating thing you
go<00:04:03.019> off<00:04:03.140> with<00:04:03.170> your<00:04:03.440> camera<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:03.920> go

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
go off with your camera and you go

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.640 
go off with your camera and you go
roaming<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.700> have<00:04:04.850> fun<00:04:05.050> actually<00:04:06.050> you

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
roaming and you have fun actually you

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.140 
roaming and you have fun actually you
know<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.950> community<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.580> photography<00:04:08.090> is

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
know the community of photography is

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.540 
know the community of photography is
incredibly<00:04:08.720> embracing<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.739> it's<00:04:10.250> having

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
incredibly embracing and it's having

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.280 
incredibly embracing and it's having
that<00:04:10.580> critique<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.420> mentorship<00:04:11.810> and

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
that critique and that mentorship and

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.650 
that critique and that mentorship and
that<00:04:13.070> you<00:04:13.340> know<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.820> kind<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.090> collaboration

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
that you know that kind of collaboration

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.219 
that you know that kind of collaboration
with<00:04:15.380> your<00:04:15.620> peers<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:17.030> really<00:04:17.450> forms<00:04:17.930> kind

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
with your peers that really forms kind

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.240 
with your peers that really forms kind
of<00:04:18.350> like<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.680> way<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.010> express

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
of like the way that you express

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.710 
of like the way that you express
yourself<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:19.940> think<00:04:19.970> challenge<00:04:20.510> is<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
yourself and I think challenge is the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.759 
yourself and I think challenge is the
way<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.870> express<00:04:21.229> yourself

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
way you express yourself

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.620 
way you express yourself
so<00:04:22.010> almost<00:04:22.190> seek<00:04:22.580> out<00:04:22.760> other<00:04:23.000> photographers

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
so almost seek out other photographers

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.690 
so almost seek out other photographers
and<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.020> advice<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.740> think<00:04:24.979> I<00:04:25.190> think<00:04:25.460> see

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
and and advice and I think I think see

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.060 
and and advice and I think I think see
criticism<00:04:26.479> I<00:04:26.780> think<00:04:26.840> look<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.470> worst<00:04:27.710> thing

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
criticism I think look the worst thing

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.540 
criticism I think look the worst thing
that<00:04:28.790> people<00:04:28.940> can<00:04:29.060> do<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.390> become<00:04:29.810> complacent

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
that people can do is become complacent

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.740 
that people can do is become complacent
and<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.669> think<00:04:31.880> if<00:04:31.970> you<00:04:32.060> have<00:04:32.240> passion<00:04:32.390> you're

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
and I think if you have passion you're

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.040 
and I think if you have passion you're
probably<00:04:32.960> not<00:04:33.410> complacent<00:04:34.479> but<00:04:35.479> I<00:04:35.510> think<00:04:35.810> that

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
probably not complacent but I think that

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.020 
probably not complacent but I think that
you<00:04:36.410> know<00:04:36.560> when<00:04:37.160> you're<00:04:37.250> stuck<00:04:37.550> on<00:04:37.700> something

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
you know when you're stuck on something

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.270 
you know when you're stuck on something
or<00:04:38.150> if<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.200> don't<00:04:39.380> show<00:04:39.650> your<00:04:39.770> imagery<00:04:40.100> to

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
or if you don't show your imagery to

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.860 
or if you don't show your imagery to
people<00:04:40.580> as<00:04:40.669> much<00:04:40.820> as<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.090> may<00:04:41.210> hate<00:04:41.419> doing<00:04:41.750> it

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
people as much as you may hate doing it

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.620 
people as much as you may hate doing it
and<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.140> do<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:43.220> know<00:04:43.340> in<00:04:43.700> order<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.090> grow<00:04:44.570> you

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
and I do you know in order to grow you

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.690 
and I do you know in order to grow you
need<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.110> be

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
need to be

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.970 
need to be
I<00:04:46.450> think<00:04:47.170> even<00:04:47.380> if<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.560> want<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.770> challenge

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
I think even if you want to challenge

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.830 
I think even if you want to challenge
that<00:04:48.220> criticism<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:48.850> say<00:04:49.030> no<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.690> know<00:04:49.810> I

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
that criticism and say no you know I

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.570 
that criticism and say no you know I
truly<00:04:50.470> believe<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.220> way<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.490> I'm

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
truly believe that the way that I'm

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.220 
truly believe that the way that I'm
making<00:04:51.820> these<00:04:51.910> images<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.570> right<00:04:52.750> way<00:04:52.930> I

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
making these images is the right way I

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.570 
making these images is the right way I
think<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:53.800> important<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.370> have<00:04:54.520> that

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
think it's important to have that

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.940 
think it's important to have that
conversation<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:55.960> think<00:04:56.170> also<00:04:56.320> like<00:04:56.680> there

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
conversation and I think also like there

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.290 
conversation and I think also like there
needs<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.160> be<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.310> balance<00:04:57.640> so<00:04:57.850> there<00:04:58.030> needs<00:04:58.210> to

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
needs to be a balance so there needs to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.450 
needs to be a balance so there needs to
be<00:04:58.390> concept<00:04:58.960> there<00:04:59.650> needs<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.860> be<00:04:59.950> content

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
be concept there needs to be content

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.340 
be concept there needs to be content
it's<00:05:00.910> wonderful<00:05:01.660> looking<00:05:01.870> at<00:05:01.990> beautiful

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
it's wonderful looking at beautiful

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.900 
it's wonderful looking at beautiful
images<00:05:02.650> but<00:05:02.920> if<00:05:03.040> there's<00:05:03.220> no<00:05:03.370> intellect

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
images but if there's no intellect

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.080 
images but if there's no intellect
behind<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.450> can't<00:05:04.750> engage<00:05:04.870> with<00:05:05.230> it<00:05:05.380> and

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
behind it I can't engage with it and

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.310 
behind it I can't engage with it and

totally<00:05:10.690> don't<00:05:10.810> get<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.800> doesn't<00:05:12.160> draw

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
totally don't get it and it doesn't draw

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.180 
totally don't get it and it doesn't draw
a<00:05:12.430> necessity<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:14.320> I<00:05:14.350> think<00:05:14.620> there<00:05:14.890> needs<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:15.100> be

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
a necessity so I think there needs to be

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.380 
a necessity so I think there needs to be
a<00:05:15.280> balance<00:05:16.170> personally<00:05:17.170> I<00:05:18.060> just<00:05:19.060> bring<00:05:19.270> you
