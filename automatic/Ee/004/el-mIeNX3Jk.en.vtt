 I played in other teams 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:11.140

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.530
 player in person we do it with a lot

 satisfaction 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.400

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.430

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.690

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 trained but always in when 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.000
 these occasions then you have to try to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.560
 demonstrate a bit of what one could 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.950
 have done a lot that the generation of 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.950
 football players 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.050

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.760
 of a profession that leaves many friends 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.430
