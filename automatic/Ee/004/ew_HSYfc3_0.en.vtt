the<00:00:18.860> Lego<00:00:19.860> Angry<00:00:20.160> Birds<00:00:20.550> go<00:00:20.850> karts<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.810> ones

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the Lego Angry Birds go karts the ones

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.980 
the Lego Angry Birds go karts the ones
that<00:00:22.860> I<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.789> animated<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.620> um<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
that I actually animated with so um I

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.100 
that I actually animated with so um I
had<00:00:27.990> many<00:00:28.260> thoughts<00:00:28.530> about<00:00:28.860> this<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.960> had<00:00:30.960> an

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
had many thoughts about this I had an

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.220 
had many thoughts about this I had an
idea<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.500> doing<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> three<00:00:32.430> part<00:00:32.790> video<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
idea of doing like a three part video of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.370 
idea of doing like a three part video of
like<00:00:34.440> making<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> base<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.079> then<00:00:37.079> doing

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
like making the base of it then doing

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.030 
like making the base of it then doing
clay<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:39.110> details<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.470> I've<00:00:40.710> decided

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
clay and like details but I've decided

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280 
clay and like details but I've decided
to<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.520> show<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> how<00:00:41.970> to<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to just show you how to do like the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.819 
to just show you how to do like the
basic<00:00:43.739> basic<00:00:44.220> art<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:45.510> there<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:45.960> almost

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
basic basic art because there are almost

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.450 
basic basic art because there are almost
infinite<00:00:47.250> ways<00:00:47.880> to<00:00:48.180> customize<00:00:48.420> these<00:00:49.460> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
infinite ways to customize these and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.520 
infinite ways to customize these and
there's<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.030> course<00:00:51.059> many<00:00:51.570> many<00:00:51.930> different

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
there's of course many many different

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
there's of course many many different
ways<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.550> form<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> face<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.540> I'm<00:00:54.840> just

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
ways to form the face of it but I'm just

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.810 
ways to form the face of it but I'm just
going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.200> show<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.380> like<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.250> very<00:00:56.460> simple

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
going to show you like the very simple

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
going to show you like the very simple
one<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.120> came<00:00:57.540> up<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.040> first

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
one that I came up with so the first

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.660 
one that I came up with so the first
thing<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.410> piece<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.370> cart

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
thing you want is a piece for your cart

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.169 
thing you want is a piece for your cart
which<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.690> usually<00:01:04.259> use<00:01:04.469> flats<00:01:05.069> I<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.850> flats

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
which I usually use flats I use flats

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.679 
which I usually use flats I use flats
just<00:01:06.770> long<00:01:07.770> flats<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.399> this<00:01:08.579> now<00:01:09.509> you're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
just long flats like this now you're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.849 
just long flats like this now you're
going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.929> want<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.139> turn<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.469> upside<00:01:10.829> down

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
going to want to turn the upside down

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.609 
going to want to turn the upside down
and<00:01:11.249> you're<00:01:11.340> gonna<00:01:11.520> attach<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.899> wheels<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and you're gonna attach some wheels to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.959 
and you're gonna attach some wheels to
it<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> simplest<00:01:15.569> way<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> attach<00:01:16.439> wheels

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
it so the simplest way to attach wheels

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.069 
it so the simplest way to attach wheels
is<00:01:18.560> by<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:20.100> adding<00:01:20.310> pieces<00:01:21.179> onto<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.899> like

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
is by just adding pieces onto it like

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.499 
is by just adding pieces onto it like
this<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> these<00:01:25.319> pieces<00:01:25.590> allow<00:01:26.069> you<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:27.240> have

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this so these pieces allow you to have

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.679 
this so these pieces allow you to have
the<00:01:27.979> joints<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.639> the<00:01:29.849> wheels<00:01:30.029> can<00:01:30.299> turn<00:01:30.509> off

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the joints that the wheels can turn off

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
the joints that the wheels can turn off
um<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:31.799> course<00:01:31.859> there's<00:01:32.219> many<00:01:32.369> different<00:01:32.579> ways

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
um of course there's many different ways

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.069 
um of course there's many different ways
of<00:01:32.969> doing<00:01:33.209> this<00:01:33.389> but<00:01:33.569> this<00:01:33.749> is<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:33.959> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of doing this but this is just the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.830 
of doing this but this is just the
simplest<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.649> now<00:01:35.459> if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.749> be

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
simplest one now if you want to be

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.349 
simplest one now if you want to be
really<00:01:37.139> simple<00:01:37.349> the<00:01:38.279> easiest<00:01:38.579> way<00:01:38.819> to<00:01:38.849> attach

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
really simple the easiest way to attach

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.719 
really simple the easiest way to attach
noodles<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.770> take<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.039> regular<00:01:41.369> wheel

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
noodles is just take a regular wheel

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.010 
noodles is just take a regular wheel
right<00:01:42.389> here<00:01:42.709> so<00:01:43.709> and<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.459> this<00:01:44.669> piece<00:01:45.020> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
right here so and take this piece and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.069 
right here so and take this piece and
you<00:01:46.259> know<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:47.119> snap<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.509> there<00:01:48.719> snap

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you know just snap that in there snap

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.419 
you know just snap that in there snap
this<00:01:49.349> in<00:01:49.499> there<00:01:49.679> now<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:51.289> yeah<00:01:53.869> like<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
this in there now just yeah like that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.319 
this in there now just yeah like that
and<00:01:57.770> yeah<00:01:58.770> let's<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.520> ahead<00:01:59.609> and<00:01:59.789> do<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.999> other

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and yeah let's go ahead and do the other

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.229 
and yeah let's go ahead and do the other
side<00:02:00.599> as<00:02:01.319> I<00:02:01.529> said<00:02:01.770> there's<00:02:02.219> many<00:02:02.939> many

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
side as I said there's many many

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.649 
side as I said there's many many
different<00:02:03.419> ways<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.049> making<00:02:04.259> wheels<00:02:04.649> so

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
different ways of making wheels so

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.470 
different ways of making wheels so
another<00:02:06.659> way<00:02:06.929> is<00:02:09.080> these<00:02:10.080> pieces<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.760> let's<00:02:12.150> go

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
another way is these pieces so let's go

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.300 
another way is these pieces so let's go
ahead

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
ahead

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.180 
ahead
this<00:02:13.550> piece<00:02:13.819> through<00:02:14.209> here<00:02:14.569> then<00:02:15.560> let's<00:02:15.980> take

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
this piece through here then let's take

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.110 
this piece through here then let's take
them<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:17.770> little<00:02:18.770> small<00:02:19.130> yellow<00:02:19.670> cross

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
them to these little small yellow cross

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.630 
them to these little small yellow cross
pieces<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:22.100> hold<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.270> place<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:27.640> number

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
pieces to hold this in place and number

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.510 
pieces to hold this in place and number
two<00:02:29.770> they're<00:02:30.770> not<00:02:31.220> you'd<00:02:31.760> wanna<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.510> them<00:02:33.050> a

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
two they're not you'd wanna have them a

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.840 
two they're not you'd wanna have them a
little<00:02:34.520> bit<00:02:34.640> separate<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:37.250> cross

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
little bit separate so that the cross

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.040 
little bit separate so that the cross
piece<00:02:38.120> closely<00:02:39.220> spin<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.540> what<00:02:41.720> you're<00:02:41.900> gonna

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
piece closely spin and what you're gonna

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.259 
piece closely spin and what you're gonna
want<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> do<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:43.390> add<00:02:44.650> some<00:02:45.880> type<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.910> wheels

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
want to do is add some type of wheels

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
and you can use any peaceful wheel so as

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.030 
and you can use any peaceful wheel so as
long<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:50.300> know<00:02:50.530> looks<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.739> wheel

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
long as it you know looks like a wheel

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.210 
long as it you know looks like a wheel
and<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.000> circular<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.690> I'm<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.019> use

the wheel pieces that have the wheels
attach<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.600> arms<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.680> we<00:03:24.799> used<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.070> have
