00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.789
 It is as important as the delicate training itself a few minutes 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.150
 when we finish to relieve the tension accumulated in the muscles 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.689
 trained 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.220
 we will do it in the following way with a series of stretching exercises 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.769
 flexibility as Beijing 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.130
 we are not looking for an increase in aggressiveness 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.519
 not only change this 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.590
 a general rule that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.079
 in maintaining the position 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.349
 20 to 30 seconds 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.060
 in a static movement 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.329
 I posted on Friday 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.600
 static passive 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.840
 i keep them two bonus 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.500
 mostly used 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.010
 for example for the breastplate simply taking a fulcrum and pulling the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.460
 body 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.490
 we can relax 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.570
 and is approved by more than the pectoral 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 which include the rules 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.789
 we will keep 20 30 seconds each positions each of the arms 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.000
 for the back 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.959
 we can do a stretch of the rosebush 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.180
 letting the shoulders 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.920
 go to the ground 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.430
 let's avoid pushing or pushing 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.040
 if not relax 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 simply by letting the body is asking for himself 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.530
 we can relieve the tension of the quadriceps 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.610
 this other stretch 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.500
 if it is not its own, it advances on the paradela line 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 will work more near the knee part of the quadriceps 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.550
 we lower the hip in the quadriceps 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 dt basquiat completely from the highest area 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.040
 to end 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.200
 is that if you want to make morals 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.230
 we will keep the attention 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.650
 there is always a comfortable movement 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.660
 if drought allowed me 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.920
 we will simply advance through our legs 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 up to kill a certain degree comfortable arrest 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 point at which we will maintain the movement 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.600
 to majors of those exercises 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.500
 we can expand it whenever necessary other muscle groups
