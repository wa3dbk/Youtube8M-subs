00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.980 
sustain knob if you want it to die a
little<00:01:49.730> earlier<00:01:50.120> have<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.290> down

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.100 

that's<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.740> little<00:01:54.920> earlier<00:01:55.600> if<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.840> want<00:01:57.020> to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
that's a little earlier if you want to

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.640 
that's a little earlier if you want to
mount<00:01:57.220> faces<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:01.100> really<00:02:01.400> ring<00:02:01.670> out<00:02:02.560> put<00:02:03.560> it

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
mount faces and really ring out put it

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.280 
mount faces and really ring out put it
all<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.890> way<00:02:03.920> up<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:04.330> sometimes<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:06.020> think

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
all the way up here sometimes I think

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.070 
all the way up here sometimes I think
this<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.770> where<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.460> because<00:02:08.080> it

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
this is where I like it because it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.040 
this is where I like it because it
doesn't<00:02:09.320> do<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> lot<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.039> feedback<00:02:10.720> but<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.780> like

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
doesn't do a lot of feedback but I like

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.170 
doesn't do a lot of feedback but I like
a<00:02:12.080> little<00:02:12.320> bit<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:12.950> that's<00:02:13.250> usually<00:02:13.970> where<00:02:14.120> I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
a little bit so that's usually where I

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.710 
a little bit so that's usually where I
keep<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:15.680> little<00:02:16.010> knob<00:02:16.280> here<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:19.720> your

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
keep it this little knob here is your

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:31.180 
keep it this little knob here is your
crunch<00:02:21.140> knob<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.989> gets<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.410> little<00:02:30.560> warmer

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
crunch knob that it gets a little warmer

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.979 
crunch knob that it gets a little warmer
as<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.700> turn<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> right<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.959> little

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
as you turn it to the right and a little

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.660 
as you turn it to the right and a little
sharper<00:02:33.590> as<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.770> turn<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.130> left

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
sharper as you turn to the left

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.229 
sharper as you turn to the left
this<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.630> called<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.200> scoop<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.150> don't<00:02:38.150> really

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
this is called a scoop I don't really

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.620 
this is called a scoop I don't really
know<00:02:39.010> technically<00:02:40.010> what<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.459> means<00:02:40.730> if

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
know technically what that means if

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.050 
know technically what that means if
anybody<00:02:42.020> on<00:02:42.200> YouTube<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:43.520> give<00:02:43.730> me<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
anybody on YouTube can give me the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.190 
anybody on YouTube can give me the
definition<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.810> scoop<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.890> would<00:02:46.070> be<00:02:46.190> great

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.020 

but<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.380> kind<00:02:51.739> of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.210 

that<00:02:54.569> thing<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.560> guess<00:02:58.740> that's<00:02:58.920> what's

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
that thing and I guess that's what's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.690 
that thing and I guess that's what's
called<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.580> scoop<00:03:00.200> doesn't<00:03:01.200> really<00:03:01.459> do<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.490> great

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
called a scoop doesn't really do a great

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:49.240 
called a scoop doesn't really do a great
job<00:03:03.030> describing

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.760
