00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 ap 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.079
 for other civilians on the site digitizers for contraction 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.310
 so mistrust 37 free editions citing for example with amnesty 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 totally free free of right 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.309
 So here is a continuation extract like predicting m 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.800
 in the folder you found an aria and 337 sithanen solutions 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.820
 so for our patients detected on server shoots backup prophet 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 that I advise you the launch of his beautiful 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 e personally i see a step on the global chessboard 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.700
 so just launch a console see 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 you started the teachers correctly 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 we will not know 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 he affuble as a Shiite suite 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.510
 so here it is nokia was then enough to throw some stuff squeezed source 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.510
 shale 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 so for a pursuit similar to twitter with character 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 very easy to use tools just make it to 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 is 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 so it is very easy to use 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.650
 and it's very easy to play with messi so we're going to go as a terrorist 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.460
 for example 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 so we could see the terrorists it's a question among others 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.760
 and the cities of course the blue boxes around them 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.589
 so what allows to spot them already through the walls 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.859
 as for the moment there 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.939
 then your tourist register of this living space 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.409
 then after you just kill them 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.459
 free rens 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.589
 so it's just synonymous boots 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.829
 very easy to play 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.909
 so 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.170
 I highly recommend it which is very possible the use 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.849
 so resume work 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.989
 so here is if you want to support them among the software side in 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:45.969
 Syria 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.969
 from here because it was commentary 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.499
 so it's other 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.439
 sail with the flash to power quote them 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.189
 finally last demonstration 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.189
 so it's totally free 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.329
 so we will finally take 18% 1 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.569
 and one thing 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.459
 what is good with this girl is one of the most at all this side of a 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.459
 world is not turning in every way as every year a classic basis 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.919
 you have each time a little for the video 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.819
 here 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.819
 so he did not see it exclude everything but it's not there 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.029
 we do not get tired of it's itss 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.029
 it pulls all happy 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.429
 so thank you for having a video bitrate 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:55.429
 but I wish to play the Shiite group 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.039
 at the next race 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.779
 a video
