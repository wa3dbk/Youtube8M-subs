00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
on the face of the plane so the first

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:41.450 
on the face of the plane so the first
one<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.900> hitting<00:00:31.640> angle<00:00:32.640> hinge<00:00:33.000> no<00:00:33.329> role<00:00:40.460> all

one is hitting angle hinge no role all

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.940 
one is hitting angle hinge no role all
right<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> second<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> be

right now the second one is going to be
a<00:00:43.980> full<00:00:44.460> roll<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.020> door<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
a full roll so this door is going to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
a full roll so this door is going to
open<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> close

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
between hitting and swinging partially

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.190 
between hitting and swinging partially
