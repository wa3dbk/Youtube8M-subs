00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
get the thick so the first thing I did

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.920 
get the thick so the first thing I did
was<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> measured<00:00:35.370> my<00:00:35.640> head<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.360> made<00:00:36.600> sure

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
was I measured my head and I made sure

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.069 
was I measured my head and I made sure
that<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.320> would<00:00:37.710> measure<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.460> way<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
that I would measure it in a way that

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
that I would measure it in a way that
the<00:00:40.079> piece<00:00:40.379> would<00:00:40.680> sit<00:00:41.010> properly<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the piece would sit properly and it

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.150 
the piece would sit properly and it
would<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.510> exactly<00:00:43.079> where<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.350> wanted<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> be

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
would be exactly where I wanted it to be

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.369 
would be exactly where I wanted it to be
and<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> happened<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.210> 3<00:00:45.600> inches<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and that happened to be 3 inches up and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.610 
and that happened to be 3 inches up and
4<00:00:47.010> inches<00:00:47.370> across<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> did<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.590> got

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
4 inches across and what I did was I got

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.790 
4 inches across and what I did was I got
a<00:00:50.010> piece<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.730> mesh<00:00:51.000> cloth<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.840> cut<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a piece of mesh cloth and I cut it in a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.939 
a piece of mesh cloth and I cut it in a
rectangle<00:00:53.460> sits<00:00:53.910> by<00:00:54.090> 4<00:00:54.329> inches<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.379> fold<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
rectangle sits by 4 inches then fold it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.760 
rectangle sits by 4 inches then fold it
is<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> 3<00:00:56.850> by<00:00:57.090> 4<00:00:57.420> inch<00:00:57.780> measurement

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
is to get the 3 by 4 inch measurement

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.760 
is to get the 3 by 4 inch measurement
then<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.730> my<00:01:00.000> wig<00:01:00.270> clip<00:01:00.570> put<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> top

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
then I got my wig clip put it at the top

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.729 
then I got my wig clip put it at the top
in<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> center<00:01:03.120> where<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.629> wasn't<00:01:04.019> folded<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
in the center where it wasn't folded and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
in the center where it wasn't folded and
I<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:06.030> used<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> marker<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.409> sure

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I just used it as a marker to make sure

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.370 
I just used it as a marker to make sure
I<00:01:07.890> cut<00:01:08.340> properly<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.960> went<00:01:10.110> ahead<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
I cut properly and I just went ahead and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490 
I cut properly and I just went ahead and
got<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:11.010> scissors<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> cut<00:01:11.900> from<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.290> base

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
got my scissors and cut from the base

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.249 
got my scissors and cut from the base
where<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.880> cloth<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.450> folded<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> way

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
where the cloth was folded all the way

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.210 
where the cloth was folded all the way
up<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.210> clip<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.439> make<00:01:19.650> sure<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> had

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
up to the clip and I make sure I had

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.210 
up to the clip and I make sure I had
about<00:01:20.689> 3<00:01:21.689> millimeters<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.560> between<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> wig

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
about 3 millimeters in between the wig

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
about 3 millimeters in between the wig
clip<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.060> end<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> cloth<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
clip and the end of the cloth so that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160 
clip and the end of the cloth so that
way<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> would<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.790> enough<00:01:27.150> space<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> work

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
way I would have enough space to work

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.399 
way I would have enough space to work
with<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.860> cloth<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:31.079> this

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
with the cloth so now I have this

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.330 
with the cloth so now I have this
trapezoid<00:01:32.130> shape<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.960> went<00:01:34.650> ahead<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
trapezoid shape and I went ahead and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
trapezoid shape and I went ahead and
used<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.939> sewing<00:01:36.210> machine<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:37.560> sew<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.960> thread

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
used my sewing machine to sew the thread

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.069 
used my sewing machine to sew the thread
where<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.680> had<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.250> cut<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.509> way<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
where I had just cut it so that way it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.710 
where I had just cut it so that way it
would<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.259> very<00:01:43.649> secure<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.090> flip<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
would be very secure when I flip it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.060 
would be very secure when I flip it
inside<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.729> flipped<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> inside<00:01:48.869> out

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
inside out so I flipped it inside out

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.270 
inside out so I flipped it inside out
after<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.549> got<00:01:51.210> two<00:01:51.600> pieces<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.619> lift<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
after that I got two pieces of lift I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.670 
after that I got two pieces of lift I
cut<00:01:53.610> two<00:01:53.820> pieces<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.240> west<00:01:54.479> about<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
cut two pieces of west about one and a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.389 
cut two pieces of west about one and a
half<00:01:55.950> inches<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.540> put<00:01:57.840> them<00:01:58.079> inside<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:59.250> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
pieces I flipped them over so that way

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.820 
pieces I flipped them over so that way
there<00:02:11.090> won't<00:02:11.270> be<00:02:11.420> any<00:02:11.599> left<00:02:11.720> showing<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.650> my

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
bank piece at all and after that I just

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.330 
bank piece at all and after that I just
went<00:02:16.430> ahead<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.730> stitched<00:02:17.239> down<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:18.340> wig

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
went ahead and stitched down the wig

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.089 
went ahead and stitched down the wig
clip<00:02:19.670> on<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.840> side<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.319> wanted<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.950> be

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
clip on the side that I wanted it to be

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.650 
clip on the side that I wanted it to be
on<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.519> can<00:02:22.670> pick<00:02:22.819> either<00:02:23.030> side<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.360> doesn't

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
on you can pick either side that doesn't

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.059 
on you can pick either side that doesn't
really<00:02:23.930> matter<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.610> started<00:02:26.269> to

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
really matter and then I started to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.759 
really matter and then I started to
stitch<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.640> rest<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.390> weaving<00:02:29.569> hair<00:02:29.930> on

to<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:32.000> piece<00:02:32.269> now<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.350> started<00:02:33.920> at<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.280> bottom

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.190 
to the piece now I started at the bottom
furthest<00:02:35.840> away<00:02:36.220> from<00:02:37.220> where<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.060> first<00:02:38.810> hair

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
that I stitched on was so that way it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.509 
that I stitched on was so that way it
wouldn't<00:02:41.870> interfere<00:02:42.170> with<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:43.040> other<00:02:43.220> hair

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
wouldn't interfere with the other hair

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.640 
wouldn't interfere with the other hair
and<00:02:43.760> make<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.209> message<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.780> as<00:02:45.530> I

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
piece was covered by whip so that way

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.090

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
this final product so this is the final

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.460 
this final product so this is the final
product<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:53.030> as<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.569> can<00:03:53.690> see<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.230> doesn't

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
product and as you can see it doesn't

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.559 
product and as you can see it doesn't
look<00:03:54.829> that<00:03:54.859> great<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.060> reason<00:03:56.359> why<00:03:56.510> is

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
look that great and the reason why is

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.690 
look that great and the reason why is
because<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:57.109> just<00:03:57.319> clipped<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.769> onto<00:03:58.250> my<00:03:58.400> hair

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
because I just clipped it onto my hair

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.420 
because I just clipped it onto my hair
what<00:03:59.359> you're<00:03:59.510> gonna<00:03:59.600> have<00:03:59.870> to<00:03:59.930> do<00:04:00.230> is<00:04:00.590> slide

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
what you're gonna have to do is slide

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.670 
what you're gonna have to do is slide
your<00:04:01.459> hair<00:04:01.790> back

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:16.539 

and<00:04:06.680> then

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.099 

so<00:04:17.120> that's<00:04:17.299> pretty<00:04:17.449> much<00:04:17.539> it<00:04:17.840> for<00:04:18.019> this

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
so that's pretty much it for this

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.900 
so that's pretty much it for this
