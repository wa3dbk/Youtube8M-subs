00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.639
 Good morning we will stop 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.719
 again at the elementary things of the 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.550
 Football works 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.020
 we are going to the so-called 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.910
 basic techniques today again us 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.550
 that is called ball acceptance 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.739
 ball capture pass game ball control 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.450
 getting used to these elementals 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.169
 The basics are quite detailed today 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.079
 discuss 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:33.320
 only the right foot right inside 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:38.420
 rich the outside we lead the ball 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.239
 just turn right to make curves 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.649
 zigzag movements yes if he does a lot 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.550
 Control almost every step of the glass 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.769
 of course, it's all about basic techniques 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.449
 to promote femininity 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.129
 that means the right foot and left foot 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.280
 to train with very purposeful 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.719
 instructions to lead a ball with the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.170
 right inside with the right one 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.390
 outside analogue left with the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.519
 sole withdraw again the head 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.380
 take to orient yourself in the top 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.110
 space rheine collisions with one 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.130
 player and permanently put the ball under 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.130
 to have control 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 we now take right and left though 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:28.980
 only be outside 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:35.000
 always nice and slow with gold 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.960
 who was taking a zigzag 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 you are welcome two times 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.860
 let's jump up and then we'll take 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.680
 the true miracle and stop and that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.800
 with the 2010 again ok I have to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.570
 to go home to me all over again 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.399
 play and pick up all over 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.500
 take outside and process 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.940
 can also jump then with the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.050
 Take the inside was almost 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.160
 too far was relatively far 1 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.119
 and keep turning and then I have 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.119
 very close officials 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.910
 to go head- on 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.550
 feign it with the left and with the right one 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.470
 outside take away both at the same time 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:48.340
 no connections to each other 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:50.410
 head in lead up okay and left 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.480
 right take that all have so well 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.430
 Now I need the connection action 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.260
 you did a great job right now 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.720
 sometimes the ball is too far 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.730
 away and in a big bow 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.720
 Run before the next couple 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:11.130
 can play says very shortly past 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.130
 and pictures check off 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.340
 In an exercise I am concerned 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.500
 position to work specifically 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.780
 means to build up in the individual positions 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.850
 eg over the defender on the 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.220
 full-backs whose open position 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.489
 So he hopes that he will take the ball 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.680
 the whole bandwidth they are in front of them 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.290
 is because with me in the outside foot takes over 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.310
 in the second contact ideally online 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.170
 to be able to play 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.590
 These are the basic ideas that is 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.450
 pass quality timing sharpness accuracy 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.450
 to train on to automate 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.319
 OK 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.260
 the
