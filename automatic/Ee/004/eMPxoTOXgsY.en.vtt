00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.960
 they want to have it already this launcher of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.880
 below is in the description of the video 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 even for you to download they do not ask you 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.410
 no code since by the demand of 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.600
 this launcher in google play the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.559
 creators of this since the unter have 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 decided to give an activation code 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.410
 when you download it from the google web 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.880
 play but and other citizens without the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.800
 activation code for conditions 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.990
 directly in android title by 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.690
 example I have it without having to 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.040
 enter no activation code 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.520
 well let's see what it is that has the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.440
 time 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.210
 what is telling you here the time and is 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.180
 the image changes according to time 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.130
 that you're working your jobs that you're going 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:17.670
 making your books hangouts email books 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.409
 etcetera setting 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.240
 has here the 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.180
 your accesses to sync the gps to 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.830
 Youtube 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.750
 wifi with this button you only press 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.960
 synchronization and wifi works 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 but if you want to save battery 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.000
 you activate it and only the gps remains 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.100
 working for you to go saying 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.680
 this launcher is going to tell you 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.600
 what are you going to have here close 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.520
 here in this part of here you will appear 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.110
 the places with if you leave somewhere 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.030
 to go to the nearest places that 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.910
 you have so it's important to have the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.619
 gps activated if you want it if not 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.130
 you can if you want to save material or 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.680
 deactivates 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.200
 with software to go to some places 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.959
 you want using your gps 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.569
 phone for example I have for 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.099
 example I already have the output activated 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.900
 from here because I have active gps and 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.390
 I have the picasso amphitheater park 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.890

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.870
 where am i 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.380
 well what else here estimate you can 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.800
 change 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.100
 james photo when wikis or not from the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.100
 Photos 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.700
 you can add a widget let's see 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.860
 how does he do it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.530
 add to box for example and then you already 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.330
 box appears but the image becomes smaller 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.150
 so 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.580
 and no longer have pricked again to me 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.320
 like it already and I like it that way and so 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.500
 I have here below you find the accesses 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.070
 direct to the applications that you most 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.320
 interest for example in this section 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.940

 and from here you keep it open and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:28.510
 from here for example if you forget or 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:32.080
 the application had to put a uses one 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.310
