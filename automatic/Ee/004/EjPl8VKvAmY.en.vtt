and we do bros again today we have our
RC<00:00:04.020> lego<00:00:04.259> plane<00:00:04.650> fully<00:00:05.040> functioning<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:06.029> can

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
RC lego plane fully functioning it can

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.020 
RC lego plane fully functioning it can
fly<00:00:06.649> okay<00:00:07.649> give<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:07.890> over<00:00:08.040> me<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> get<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.790> no

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
fly okay give it over me I get it no

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.150 
fly okay give it over me I get it no
this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> Estes<00:00:10.200> controller<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.889> used<00:00:11.070> to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
this is the Estes controller it used to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.860 
this is the Estes controller it used to
go<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> an<00:00:11.550> old<00:00:11.700> helicopter<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.360> used<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.660> have

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
go to an old helicopter I used to have

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.959 
go to an old helicopter I used to have
but<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.410> linked<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.769> up<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> servos<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.820> this

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
but I linked it up to the servos on this

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.180 
but I linked it up to the servos on this
plane<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.450> actually<00:00:16.230> works<00:00:16.470> really<00:00:16.680> good

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
plane and actually works really good

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.490 
plane and actually works really good
here's<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> fly<00:00:18.180> zone<00:00:18.449> battery<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.050> wire

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
here's the fly zone battery and the wire

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.529 
here's the fly zone battery and the wire
that<00:00:19.830> runs<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> motor<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:21.000> runs<00:00:21.300> this

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that runs to the motor which runs this

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
that runs to the motor which runs this
thing<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:22.109> which<00:00:22.590> makes<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.160> go<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
thing here which makes this up go up and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.429 
thing here which makes this up go up and
down<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.210> makes<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> air<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
down that makes it go up in the air and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.720 
down that makes it go up in the air and
then<00:00:25.769> down<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.250> air<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.970> oh<00:00:28.490> man<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> got

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
then down in the air and oh man I got

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.759 
then down in the air and oh man I got
some<00:00:29.880> snot<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.240> nose<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.349> propeller

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
some snot in my nose and this propeller

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
some snot in my nose and this propeller
makes<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.640> fly<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.420> makes<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.110> wind

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
makes it like fly it makes the wind

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.330 
makes it like fly it makes the wind
pushes<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.390> goes<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
pushes it like this and that goes up and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.540 
pushes it like this and that goes up and
so<00:00:38.600> yeah<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.350> looks<00:00:40.530> okay<00:00:41.070> let's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so yeah that's just for looks okay let's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.100 
so yeah that's just for looks okay let's
get<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.790> flying<00:00:43.370> let<00:00:44.370> me<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.610> controller

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
get it flying let me get my controller

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.779 
get it flying let me get my controller
turn<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.160> bit<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> great<00:00:47.579> turn
