won<00:00:24.960> Oriana<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.769> how<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> weird<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> leaf

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
won Oriana is how a weird that the leaf

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.660 
won Oriana is how a weird that the leaf
teas<00:00:26.970> open<00:00:27.390> over<00:00:27.930> speaker<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.189> then<00:00:29.429> we

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
teas open over speaker and then we

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.460 
teas open over speaker and then we
pretty<00:00:29.880> much<00:00:29.970> had<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:31.019> strong<00:00:31.260> champion

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
pretty much had a really strong champion

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
pretty much had a really strong champion
already<00:00:31.890> then<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.520> thought<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.820> would<00:00:32.880> pick

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
already then we thought it would pick

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.049 
already then we thought it would pick
jungle<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> TF<00:00:34.590> already<00:00:34.920> because<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.940> had

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
jungle not the TF already because we had

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
jungle not the TF already because we had
the<00:00:36.180> things<00:00:36.390> already<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.829> use

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the things already but then they use

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.470 
the things already but then they use
pick<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> evaluation<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.120> could<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
pick the evaluation so we could get a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
pick the evaluation so we could get a
listen<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.559> are<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:40.950> strong

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
listen and if which are really strong

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.770 
listen and if which are really strong
champions<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.270> diamond<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.660> way

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
champions what I think diamond is way

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.250 
champions what I think diamond is way
better<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.079> those<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> he<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.829> his<00:00:43.920> corner

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
better on those and he is on his corner

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
better on those and he is on his corner
so<00:00:46.260> when<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.500> had<00:00:46.620> those<00:00:46.739> champions<00:00:47.160> pretty

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so when we had those champions pretty

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.619 
so when we had those champions pretty
much<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.579> feel<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.270> felt<00:00:48.480> really

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
much we feel really we felt really

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.729 
much we feel really we felt really
confident<00:00:49.020> array<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.500> had<00:00:49.620> good

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
confident array that we had good

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
confident array that we had good
champions<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.309> their<00:00:50.460> setup<00:00:50.820> was<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
champions on their setup was not that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.860 
champions on their setup was not that
great<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.730> could<00:00:53.879> pick<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> banal<00:00:54.539> ready

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
great so we could pick a banal ready

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
great so we could pick a banal ready
just<00:00:55.590> let<00:00:55.649> her<00:00:55.860> free<00:00:56.070> farm<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.579> knew<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
just let her free farm and we knew that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.209 
just let her free farm and we knew that
the<00:00:57.449> moment<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.289> keep<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.500> equality

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the moment we just keep going equality

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.970 
the moment we just keep going equality
ligand<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.670> win<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.600> even<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:00.960> day<00:01:01.140> we

I think it's more more as a team like he

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
I think it's more more as a team like he
played<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.909> before<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.110> he<00:01:25.229> played

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
played them before and I think he played

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.649 
played them before and I think he played
them<00:01:25.619> son<00:01:26.369> sometimes<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.970> might<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.240> work<00:01:27.299> but

couple<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.320> years<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.489> think<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
couple of years now what do you think it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.550 
couple of years now what do you think it
is<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.270> don't<00:02:09.810> seem<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.080> get<00:02:10.229> going

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
is that they don't seem to get going

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
is that they don't seem to get going
anymore<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.400> season

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
anymore in the season

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.470 
anymore in the season
I<00:02:13.459> don't<00:02:14.459> know<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.730> hard<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.970> tell<00:02:15.150> from<00:02:15.269> them

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
I don't know it's hard to tell from them

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.809 
I don't know it's hard to tell from them
it's<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.800> just<00:02:16.950> feel<00:02:17.129> like<00:02:17.250> they<00:02:17.400> kinda

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.000 
it's just it just feel like they kinda
lose<00:02:18.720> track<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.200> game<00:02:19.349> before<00:02:19.560> they<00:02:19.860> knew

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
lose track of the game before they knew

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.559 
lose track of the game before they knew
were<00:02:20.160> they<00:02:20.340> had<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.640> go<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:21.030> they<00:02:21.150> had<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.300> do

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
were they had to go what they had to do

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
seem to have lost that I with their the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.800 
seem to have lost that I with their the
thing<00:02:26.489> even<00:02:26.700> with<00:02:26.819> when<00:02:27.209> they<00:02:27.330> had<00:02:27.480> Alex

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
thing even with when they had Alex

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.619 
thing even with when they had Alex
already<00:02:28.080> decided<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.680> slowly<00:02:29.400> become<00:02:30.390> works

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
already decided to slowly become works

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.089 
already decided to slowly become works
they<00:02:30.840> had<00:02:30.959> game<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.319> they<00:02:31.440> were<00:02:31.709> good<00:02:31.950> they

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
they had game that they were good they

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.920 
they had game that they were good they
hugging<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.489> they<00:02:32.610> were<00:02:32.700> bad<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.540> now<00:02:33.900> I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
hugging that they were bad but now I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.720 
hugging that they were bad but now I
just<00:02:34.049> feel<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.530> they<00:02:34.680> are<00:02:34.769> not<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.220> strong<00:02:35.580> as

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
just feel like they are not as strong as

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.190 
just feel like they are not as strong as
a<00:02:35.760> team<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.239> as<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.540> were<00:02:36.660> before<00:02:36.810> I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
a team that they as they were before I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.809 
a team that they as they were before I
don't<00:02:37.440> think<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:38.370> are<00:02:38.400> some<00:02:38.610> games

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
don't think that there are some games

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.369 
don't think that there are some games
that<00:02:38.879> they<00:02:39.120> do<00:02:39.420> really<00:02:39.629> good<00:02:39.810> individually

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
that they do really good individually

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.440 
that they do really good individually
but<00:02:40.560> then<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.890> comes<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.280> two<00:02:41.879> team<00:02:42.090> played<00:02:42.330> two

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
but then it comes to two team played two

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.729 
but then it comes to two team played two
rotations<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.049> everything<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.650> are

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
rotations to everything and they are

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.470 
rotations to everything and they are
used<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.099> bit<00:02:44.580> low<00:02:44.760> sometimes<00:02:45.269> they<00:02:45.420> do

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
used a bit low sometimes they do

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.940 
used a bit low sometimes they do
something<00:02:45.870> good<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.200> most<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> time<00:02:46.799> they

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
something good but most of the time they

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.589 
something good but most of the time they
are<00:02:47.040> following<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.640> other<00:02:47.760> guys<00:02:48.000> then

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
are following the other guys then

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.050 
are following the other guys then
emitting<00:02:49.019> rotations<00:02:49.890> well<00:02:50.519> turning

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
emitting rotations well turning

something that can happen if we play
really<00:03:28.739> good<00:03:28.889> like<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.940> don't<00:03:30.090> think<00:03:30.329> today<00:03:30.510> we

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
really good like I don't think today we

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.210 
really good like I don't think today we
play<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.049> good<00:03:31.200> even<00:03:31.440> though<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:32.040> seemed

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220

like<00:03:32.430> we<00:03:32.459> had<00:03:32.549> control<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> don't<00:03:33.269> think<00:03:33.420> we

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
like we had control I don't think we

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.759 
like we had control I don't think we
play<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.840> good<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.049> think<00:03:34.200> we<00:03:34.380> play<00:03:34.560> better

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.280 
play that good I think we play better
yesterday<00:03:35.069> so<00:03:36.060> if<00:03:36.209> if<00:03:36.599> tomorrow<00:03:36.989> we<00:03:37.109> play<00:03:37.139> like

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
yesterday so if if tomorrow we play like

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.080 
yesterday so if if tomorrow we play like
yesterday<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.130> we<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.459> good<00:03:38.609> setup<00:03:38.849> I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
yesterday and we get a good setup I

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.089 
yesterday and we get a good setup I
think<00:03:39.299> we<00:03:39.359> can<00:03:39.510> beat<00:03:39.690> them<00:03:39.840> why<00:03:40.139> is<00:03:40.200> fanatic<00:03:40.920> so

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
think we can beat them why is fanatic so

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.559 
think we can beat them why is fanatic so
much<00:03:41.250> more<00:03:41.430> dominant<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:41.910> super<00:03:42.239> weak<00:03:42.359> you

in this heat of the season and the
importance<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.709> games<00:04:19.859> right<00:04:20.039> now

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
importance of the of the games right now

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.570 
importance of the of the games right now

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
I think it always happened to us like

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.890 
I think it always happened to us like
last<00:04:23.880> year<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.120> pretty<00:04:24.300> much<00:04:24.390> happened<00:04:24.630> the

same<00:04:25.050> at<00:04:25.260> least<00:04:25.409> personally<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.979> I<00:04:26.039> think<00:04:26.219> to

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
same at least personally and I think to

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.600 
same at least personally and I think to
every

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610

the<00:04:56.430> worst<00:04:56.610> feeling<00:04:56.789> you<00:04:56.969> can<00:04:57.120> have<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.419> when

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
the worst feeling you can have is when

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.929 
the worst feeling you can have is when
we<00:04:58.050> lose<00:04:58.680> by<00:04:58.710> one<00:04:58.979> game<00:04:59.310> or<00:04:59.520> something<00:04:59.819> and

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
we lose by one game or something and

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.309 
we lose by one game or something and
then<00:05:00.060> we<00:05:00.150> are<00:05:00.240> like<00:05:00.360> if<00:05:00.479> we<00:05:00.629> practice<00:05:00.840> one<00:05:01.169> week

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
then we are like if we practice one week

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.990 
then we are like if we practice one week
more<00:05:01.469> we<00:05:01.620> could<00:05:01.710> have<00:05:01.770> made<00:05:01.949> it<00:05:02.009> so<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.550> think

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
more we could have made it so I think

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.760 
more we could have made it so I think
it's<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.389> best<00:05:03.539> to<00:05:03.719> practice<00:05:04.080> when<00:05:04.409> then<00:05:04.590> is

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
it's the best to practice when then is

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.830 
it's the best to practice when then is
coming<00:05:05.099> for<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.340> super<00:05:05.669> weeks<00:05:05.909> where<00:05:06.539> you<00:05:06.659> can
