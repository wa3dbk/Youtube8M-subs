00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
year so I wanted to really stick within

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.180 
year so I wanted to really stick within
about<00:00:33.690> twenty<00:00:34.110> dollar<00:00:34.290> limit<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.829> I'm<00:00:34.920> really

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
about twenty dollar limit and I'm really

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650 
about twenty dollar limit and I'm really
proud<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.429> what<00:00:35.789> I<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:36.000> able<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> come<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.539> with

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
proud of what I was able to come up with

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
I guess I didn't want this to be both

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240 
I guess I didn't want this to be both
practical<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.480> personal<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.109> I<00:00:40.890> wanted<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
practical and personal and I wanted to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
character heard some ideas and I thought

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750 
character heard some ideas and I thought
about<00:00:54.149> their<00:00:54.510> dollar<00:00:54.929> spot<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.679> after<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
about their dollar spot and after that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
about their dollar spot and after that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.050 
started out here with this on the dollar
section<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:31.070> wanted<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> give<00:01:32.549> her<00:01:32.880> a

thinking of either relaxing but beach or
relaxing<00:01:38.610> by<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.789> pool<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.360> luckily<00:01:40.579> also<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
relaxing by the pool and luckily also it

in<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.109> Summer<00:01:49.649> Isles<00:01:49.859> so<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
in the Summer Isles so this is a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.740 
in the Summer Isles so this is a
seven-foot<00:01:50.909> beach<00:01:51.060> towel<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.539> was<00:01:51.630> on

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
seven-foot beach towel it was on

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.910 
seven-foot beach towel it was on
clearance<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> liked<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> because<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
clearance and I liked it because it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.469

matches the interior of my bag and then

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.929 
matches the interior of my bag and then
after<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.109> I<00:01:59.039> thought<00:01:59.369> she<00:01:59.579> would<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.060 
after that I thought she would want to
take<00:02:00.090> something<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.659> her<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.229> drink<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
take something with her to drink to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.190 
take something with her to drink to
either<00:02:02.490> where<00:02:02.759> she<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.270> keep<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> cool<00:02:03.810> so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
either where she was and keep it cool so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.029 
either where she was and keep it cool so
