but<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.649> does<00:01:39.799> dry<00:01:40.069> clear<00:01:41.079> once<00:01:42.079> that's<00:01:42.349> dry

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
but it does dry clear once that's dry

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.649 
but it does dry clear once that's dry
you<00:01:42.679> can<00:01:42.890> see<00:01:43.159> it's<00:01:43.280> completely<00:01:43.819> clear<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.329> it

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
you can see it's completely clear and it

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.330 
you can see it's completely clear and it
probably<00:01:44.840> feels<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.319> little<00:01:45.469> bit<00:01:45.709> sticky<00:01:46.189> but

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
probably feels a little bit sticky but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.940 
probably feels a little bit sticky but
that's<00:01:47.329> absolutely<00:01:47.780> fine<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.530> can<00:01:48.679> go<00:01:48.799> ahead

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's absolutely fine you can go ahead

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.770 
that's absolutely fine you can go ahead
and<00:01:49.159> kind<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.670> start<00:01:49.879> picking<00:01:50.270> at<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.450> and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
and kind of start picking at it and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.630 
and kind of start picking at it and
you'll<00:01:51.140> find<00:01:51.319> it's<00:01:51.500> really<00:01:51.770> stretchy<00:01:52.129> and<00:01:52.549> you

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
you'll find it's really stretchy and you

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.260 
you'll find it's really stretchy and you
can<00:01:52.819> make<00:01:52.969> holes<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:54.170> latex<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.179> kind<00:01:56.179> of

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
can make holes in the latex and kind of

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.850 
can make holes in the latex and kind of
roll<00:01:56.509> it<00:01:56.539> back<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.259> make<00:01:57.439> it<00:01:57.560> look<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:57.679> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
roll it back to make it look like the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.339 
roll it back to make it look like the
skins<00:01:58.340> been<00:01:58.520> rolled<00:01:58.969> back<00:01:59.179> you<00:01:59.989> might<00:02:00.140> find

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
skins been rolled back you might find

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.440 
skins been rolled back you might find
that<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:00.709> easier<00:02:01.129> to<00:02:01.369> use<00:02:01.520> tweezers<00:02:01.879> instead

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
that it's easier to use tweezers instead

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.479 
that it's easier to use tweezers instead
of<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:02.689> your<00:02:02.840> fingers<00:02:03.049> for<00:02:03.439> this<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.399> you

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489 
of just your fingers for this and you

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:05.859 
of just your fingers for this and you
can<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:04.789> kind<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.090> do<00:02:05.239> this<00:02:05.420> wherever<00:02:05.659> you

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
can just kind of do this wherever you

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.710 
can just kind of do this wherever you
like<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:06.319> decided<00:02:06.709> to<00:02:07.009> do<00:02:07.219> a<00:02:07.459> big<00:02:07.939> one<00:02:08.149> in<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
like I decided to do a big one in the

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.800 
like I decided to do a big one in the
middle<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.170> my<00:02:09.229> hand<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.160> then<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:11.030> decided<00:02:11.390> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
middle of my hand and then I decided to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.289 
middle of my hand and then I decided to
roll<00:02:12.140> some<00:02:12.379> back<00:02:12.560> by<00:02:12.859> the<00:02:12.920> fingers<00:02:13.519> but<00:02:14.209> this

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
roll some back by the fingers but this

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.690 
roll some back by the fingers but this
is<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:14.480> all<00:02:14.840> personal<00:02:15.379> opinion<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:16.040> how<00:02:16.640> you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
is just all personal opinion and how you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.180 
is just all personal opinion and how you
want<00:02:16.879> your<00:02:17.000> zombie<00:02:17.569> hand<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.109> look<00:02:20.920> once<00:02:21.920> I've

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
want your zombie hand to look once I've

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.309 
want your zombie hand to look once I've
made<00:02:22.549> all<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> holes<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.389> I<00:02:23.450> want<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.900> i'm

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
going to go ahead and put another layer

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.449 
going to go ahead and put another layer
of<00:02:25.880> liquid<00:02:26.180> latex<00:02:26.720> over<00:02:26.989> all<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:28.040> just<00:02:28.280> means

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
of liquid latex over all this just means

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.190 
of liquid latex over all this just means
i<00:02:28.609> can<00:02:28.790> make<00:02:28.940> some<00:02:29.120> holes<00:02:29.359> within<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.049> holes

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
i can make some holes within the holes

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.110 
i can make some holes within the holes
if<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.500> makes<00:02:30.709> sense<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.670> also<00:02:31.819> means

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
if that makes sense and it also means

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.420 
if that makes sense and it also means
there's<00:02:32.329> a<00:02:32.389> bit<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.690> layer<00:02:32.840> between<00:02:33.040> my<00:02:34.040> skin

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
there's a bit of a layer between my skin

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
to blend out the lines to stop them

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.890 
to blend out the lines to stop them
looking<00:03:19.920> so<00:03:20.160> harsh<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.760> just<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.510> make<00:03:21.540> our

looking so harsh and just to make our

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.620 
looking so harsh and just to make our
injuries<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.920> saw<00:03:23.240> in<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.390> middle

just taking a brush and I'm going to
spread<00:04:31.770> out<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.010> fake<00:04:32.850> blood<00:04:33.180> but<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:33.750> want

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
spread out the fake blood but you want

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.350 
spread out the fake blood but you want
to<00:04:33.960> make<00:04:34.140> sure<00:04:34.200> that<00:04:34.740> it's<00:04:35.190> kind<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.610> collected

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
to make sure that it's kind of collected

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.900 
to make sure that it's kind of collected
in<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:37.530> part<00:04:37.920> which<00:04:38.100> you've<00:04:38.280> peeled<00:04:38.550> back<00:04:38.850> the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
in the part which you've peeled back the

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.090 
in the part which you've peeled back the
liquid<00:04:39.420> latex<00:04:39.870> so<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.260> kind<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.530> pulls<00:04:40.830> in

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
liquid latex so it kind of pulls in

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:56.270 
liquid latex so it kind of pulls in
certain<00:04:41.580> areas

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.559

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.820 

and<00:05:01.460> then<00:05:02.460> finally<00:05:02.729> you<00:05:03.240> can<00:05:03.659> take<00:05:03.990> some<00:05:04.409> more

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830
