00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.780
 and I'm going to give you a tutorial on how 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.120
 solve the problem of textures in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.820
 very expensive and at once the message of my 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.520
 sign and it appears when you did not detect a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 map or something like that you know is the problem 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.490
 of 2000 without more can not serve fucking 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.130
 Map 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 ok now I'm going to show you an image 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.000
 what I 'm talking about 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.379
 very good as an image parameter there is a 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.040
 textures problem where the paintings 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.350
 they are like pink and black and the objects 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.410
 that is, the products when you play for 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 jan is the most likely to appear with 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.770
 an error message 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.629
 ok the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.690
 enter our browser 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.910
 preference in my case the google chrome 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.760
 and copy the link that I'm going to leave 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.670
 in the description I have it ready already 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.670
 for control but I'm going ok 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.689
 expensive son of a bitch 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.420
 very well here we have this page and 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:19.350
 we have to enter harris county good 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.439
 Carrie condemns if I am an Englishman of the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.930
 cojones and good pa negre this picture that 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.510
 I did with 33 tours 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.790
 for textures to solve the forte 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.700
 the textures we have to go to this link 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.390
 Well, this little box that says mega or 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.100
 any download manager and in my 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.009
 case it would be mega 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.300
 and for those for my sigma problem 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.600
 we have to go 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.520
 here is the box where it says maps 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.100
 in case you want to drop here 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.100
 here speaks does not matter ok 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.500
 we have to open this thing more than me 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.180
 since I already have the saved file, I do not 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.759
 I will make you have to wait for 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.159
 let the publicity pass and then download 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.380
 the mega equal here in this case also 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.220
 is the a flight and I have the cloc 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.310
 because I do not like advertising 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.170
 is very angry to ok very well 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.420
 When you are hot you are going to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.770
 download the files to you is 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.840
 upload and download go redundancy 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.790
 they are going to download the files that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.590
 enter my case and I give them to compress 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.900
 to not take long in this video 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.180
 and what we are going to do is copy these 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.440
 things in my case can cut them 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.440
 because they do not have to be here 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.500
 ok and we go to the folder where is the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.830
 rhythms 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.360
 in my case like I have bought this 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:53.230
 half of my card in my steam folder 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.230
 those destined with charisma 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.260
 and here the folder of the abyss and then 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.599
 we enter addons as you can see here 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.150
 I have the folders here but I 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.150
 because I am very malandro you can hit them 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.950
 it's going to take a poster they know it's not 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.290
 always not here the scene 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.269
 and with this you can solve these 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.330
 problems and it worked for me I had that 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.420
 problem before and end there is no missing 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.120
 map and texture problems very well that 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.120
 it's all for today we'll see you then I'll
