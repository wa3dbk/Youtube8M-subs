lie and you got to use your scorpion

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.370

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
think he has a worse range out of all

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
think he has a worse range out of all
the<00:01:38.729> shotguns<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.299> honest<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:40.560> it's
