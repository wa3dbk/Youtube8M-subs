00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
because these ones do have out the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.830 
because these ones do have out the
advance<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.730> does<00:00:45.030> mean<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
advance which does mean that there is a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
advance which does mean that there is a
snapdragon<00:00:46.440> 800<00:00:46.739> processor<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.520> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
snapdragon 800 processor on these so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
snapdragon 800 processor on these so
let's<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.780> hope<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:49.950> these

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
was a two month old iphone 5c n all she

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
was a two month old iphone 5c n all she
remembers<00:01:38.909> doing<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.689> sitting<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> phone

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
remembers doing is sitting on the phone

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520 
remembers doing is sitting on the phone
while<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.490> her<00:01:41.700> pant<00:01:42.000> pocket<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
while it was in her pant pocket so it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.960 
while it was in her pant pocket so it
turns<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.950> apparently<00:01:44.430> she<00:01:44.670> snapped

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
turns out that apparently she snapped

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.969 
turns out that apparently she snapped
the<00:01:45.119> battery<00:01:45.479> when<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.020> happened<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the battery when that happened and a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.649 
the battery when that happened and a
couple<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> minutes<00:01:47.310> later<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> ignited<00:01:48.240> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
couple of minutes later it ignited so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.210 
couple of minutes later it ignited so
obviously<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.920> an<00:01:50.009> investigation

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
obviously there is an investigation

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.300 
obviously there is an investigation
there<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.119> most<00:01:51.299> probably<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> lawsuit<00:01:52.310> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
there will most probably be a lawsuit so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
there will most probably be a lawsuit so
while<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.729> happens<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.420> while<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.750> figure

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
while that happens and while we figure

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.859 
while that happens and while we figure
