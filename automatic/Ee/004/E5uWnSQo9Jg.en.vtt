00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.389
 the next video we will learn to claw 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.389
 who plays Chilean in the following way 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:50.520
 it's always true but with the goat 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:59.590
 in this way we cover it with this part 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.140
 hand the first three strings and 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.259
 with this we sound the following 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.540
 three pre form a little more of the sector 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.050
 things to handle the guitar but not 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.050
 let go 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.270
 the whole pattern would be 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.670
 Y 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.670
 ah 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.090
 and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.090
 the whole pattern would be 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.150
 two levels if we understand this as one 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.860
 that we have that as one would be two and 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.360
 means before changing the next 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.360
 I agreed that always the fifth degree 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280
 i 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.670
 is older 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.290
 and that for those people more strength 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.739
 fast to the coast 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.739
 a little bit higher 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.650
 we have another modality is a whole network 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.220
 which is usually in the still 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.220
 of my greatest 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.610
 Y 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.900
 within the network it is true to be 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.370
 anyone who can reach and 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.370
 close the song but at the moment 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.410
 next the singer asks a musician 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:48.200
 and give the signal the signal tells me we're going 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.009
 for there musician everything understand that 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.930
 have to go to my oldest with seventh 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.930
 to make the change 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.230
 the papaya 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.270
 girlfriend 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.270
 all dressed in white 

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:34.689
 the earth 

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:34.689
 of fairies 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:43.620
 with this signal that is given to the 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:47.450
 musicians who always have a melody 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.450
 will dictate what to always run 

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:54.569
 and well we hope that 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.490
 practicing
