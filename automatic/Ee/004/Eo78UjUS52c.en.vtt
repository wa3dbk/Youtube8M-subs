00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.020
 This video is also possible 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.020
 by microsoft mobile devices 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.110
 one of the new mid-range telephones 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 just before this mobile world congress 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.850
 announced is the lg spirit 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.650
 lg spirit is available in 3g version and and 4g 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.400
 version in this him sometimes i would go him 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.840
 discuss 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
 the design of the lg spirit is 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.680
 based on that of the lg g flex 2 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.449
 this is can is even a small one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.220
 little crooked he has on the screen 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.140
 has a very small radius of 3 meters 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.850
 or a very large radius and with that nele 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 small curvature 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.090
 then I really don't notice that much 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.430
 if your device is both fixed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.530
 the back which is slightly bolder and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 he noticed a little more gold there 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 therefore just nice and tasty 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.030
 in hand 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.469
 otherwise the device is quite square 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.489
 perhaps the corners are just that way 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.710
 a bit sharp 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.020
 well the buttons are on the back 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.280
 power button with volume buttons and you can 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 in this device just good relief 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 feel in between which makes that well 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 this lt holds great eversion rivers 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.289
 became a man who has a metallic 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.940
 back the not every one version that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.769
 Here lies who has a ribbed 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 back which finds something nicer 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.939
 feel a little less smooth and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.590
 you would also scratch a little less and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.810
 notice fingerprints 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.159
 LG Spirit has a 4.7 inch screen that 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.540
 his hd display 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.420
 and that looks are nice 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.549
 naturally sharp in terms of colors 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.229
 pretty good it's not super 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.180
 most beautiful screen I have ever seen 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.470
 but the contrast is high enough 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.240
 colors are fairly vibrant 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.860
 screen brightness is also higher 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.659
 still and here also on sheets there is light 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 I can read a great one 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.070
 so more that is right on the screen 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.090
 little space 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.310
 The processor of the device also differs 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.080
 between the two versions the 3G version 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.760
 has a mediatek processor 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.770
 is a quad core chip beaten at 1.3 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 guide the 4g version has a qualcomm 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.320
 Processor 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.200
 that also a quad core chip but daily newspaper 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.120
 on just 1.2 gigahertz 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.530
 yes here at the fair I find it difficult 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.540
 to have a different performance in between 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.400
 the two to notice what I do notice is that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 he just isn't running completely smoothly 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.940
 sometimes you just have a little fun and that 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 is a pity 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.180
 yes then this could be the pre-release 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.410
 software and yes yes that would just be 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.390
 can be eliminated because mine 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.950
 Experience with other LG phones with 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.110
 his self processor is positive 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.520
 has a gigabyte internally or one 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.470
 gigabyte of memory 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.660
 8 gigabytes of internal memory and that is 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.800
 of course all completely fine 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.930
 the camera is a 5 to 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.360
 and 4g version is an 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.980
 in 3g version a 5 megapixel camera for 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.510
 as far as I have understood 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.300
 at the front is a 1 megapixel 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.190
 camera and arm and the mainstage spirit 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.240
 just camera area a fairly complete 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.770
 phone 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.260
 The interface is the interface that we 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.810
 Know the LG G3 on Android Lollipop 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 is nice that this cheap phone 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.070
 even just runs on android lollipop 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.720
 the check mark very positive and through that 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.480
 to throw inversion from me 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.370
 has combat functions for you and you 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.750
 also runs smooth works fine or it runs 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.670
 so will not be super on this device 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.530
 but overall the smooth and faithful 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.990
 nice interface and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.819
 yes telephone is a complete one 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.690
 phone in the fine phone for no 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.900
 so much money 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.120
 the 4G version will cost 199 euros 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.170
 3G version is just cheaper to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.760
 vc 170 euros and for that money is the lg 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.600
 spirit at first glance 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.600
 great smartphone
