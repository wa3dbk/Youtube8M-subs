 underwent a thorough medical examination 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.850

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.490

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.980
 only we just had to 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.070

 until finished her performances in sports 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:08.120
 Galya kisses that is this such here 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.010
 our only child 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.680
 which of their own accord 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.680
 and of course we lost the heavyweight 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.890
 so we have a women's team 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 protrude 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.750
 four but we san hope we have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.670
 the oil seal and Natasha have Medvedev Julia 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 Well, Irina Poleteva, I'm a simpleton with us 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.460
 will not give places to other athletes not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 I love forecasts but I can, instead of forecasts 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.470
 say that the ministry 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.710
 ours is our sport 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.950
 powerlifting really hopes that we are very 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.520
 we will have many places 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.229
 piggy bank of gold medals and talk 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.190
 specifically that is, we have of course 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.350
 their claims who can we become 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.119
 champions but i want paradise 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:07.259
 Competition will sport May today 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.259
 equipped us and at four o'clock must 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.350
 to meet with one of 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.739
 Minsport executives or is it vitali 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.720
 mutko will or his deputy and 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.710
 the sport ministry us never 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.050
 forgets if 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.440
 There are problems that now but this 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.160
 connected more with financing 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.600
 still very high costs go on 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.700
 sochi 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.400
 why we are here but in general is now 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.740
 the process of solving all the same question I 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.470
 I hope that I still want him 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.770
 solve this on our leading scholarships 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.160
 athletes are 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:53.960
 and the second question is probably my problem 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.020
 September month with the next year 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.640
 to this hour we will not have time to do it all the same 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.780
 typing junior team 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.910
 because under the terms of the competition 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.120
 international awards needed 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.490
 getting out of the tracksuit problems like 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.660
 it turned out more than they really 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.340
 were covered as if in the press and on 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.320
 meetings it is precisely the problems that but the connection 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 Ministry of Sports, we are with the training center 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.050
 national teams should be much 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.470
 closer 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.930
 that in general is just me now 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.880
 to feel myself the more I appear so 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.490
 the question is solved quickly enough 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.820
 even if you take the world games though 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.590
 support was but mostly frequent 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.320
 visits 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.390
 jet exam that is helped us all in 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.610
 Generally solve financial issues with 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.610
 our stay in the knee 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.040
 we are before this competition and we will 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.150
 may continue to be at the door 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.260
 first teams 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.390
 but so far the conversation is just classics we 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.140
 in the Czech Republic this year have entered into an agreement with 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.160
 English 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.090
 outfitting company sbd and now 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.030
 you can be more precise they are waiting for us, yes, in general 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.070
 sure that we have nothing good with 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.370
 point of view doping control and then I do not 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.980
 happened so we are waiting for the results on 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.470
 International site is waiting for this English 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.160
 on it to pay our prize 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.920
 champions 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.640
 that is, under the terms of the contract, they 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.770
 equipped all teams of the speaker 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.370
 classi triathlon team ranging from 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.400
 boys 18 cums adults equipped 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.220
 no knee pads kombin zones shirts 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.790
 socks that is wealth and it was in 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.830
 subject to the contract was that the champion who 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.870
 wins these games provided 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.370
 negatively convenient control will turn out 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.530
 another Â£ 1,000 but now they 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.200
 they are waiting here we are with them very much 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.870
 keep in touch and want to develop 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.900
 chain stores agree to equip 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.780
 on classic triathlon now 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.280
 already in Moscow we try it through 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.100
 sports workshop where 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.430
 probably knows this surname maxim 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.560
 mihailov this shop 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.540
 that's why it leads 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.100
 Any progress I think that in Russia 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.840
 until the future of the classic instrument is and 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.270
 already at level 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.030
 sounded at international meetings 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:37.060
 federations what are they 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.950
 what makes me so worried that they are 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.330
 in general, they can 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:47.350
 lean over such a sharp rise 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:50.770
 classic triathlon at the expense of 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:54.670
 outfit yes although I think it is not 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:58.230
 So quickly happen but options at all 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:03.460
 there is now an hour as far as i know in 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:06.070
 St. Petersburg 26 27 May 30 Congress 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.140
 other sports and was our 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.690
 international president international 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.870
 federation there what about 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.720
 recognition sports non-Olympic 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.320
 sports in the olympic movement and in 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.660
 in general 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.970
 Well, this is from the international federation 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.400
 Of course it depends on us on the federation 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.100
 but a lot will mean what kind of scales 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.970
 can win classic or such 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:35.770
 triathlon though well honestly want 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:39.240
 but in the Olympiad have two types associated with 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.990
 barbell it probably is 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.250
 functionaries of the international Olympic 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.580
 those are probably not good but we 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.580
 we hope
