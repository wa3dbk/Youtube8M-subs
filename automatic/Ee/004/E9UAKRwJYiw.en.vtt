00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
Parisian chocolate a lot of people don't

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.540 
Parisian chocolate a lot of people don't
associate<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> ice<00:00:34.770> cream<00:00:35.010> Cottage<00:00:35.430> with

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.049 
associate the ice cream Cottage with
making<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.030> gourmet<00:00:36.890> dessert<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.790> they're

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
making a gourmet dessert because they're

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.569 
making a gourmet dessert because they're
so<00:00:39.210> reasonably<00:00:39.780> priced<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.469> guess<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.890> don't

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so reasonably priced I guess they don't

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
so reasonably priced I guess they don't
expect<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.239> we're<00:00:42.390> using<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.870> freshest<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
expect that we're using the freshest and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
expect that we're using the freshest and
finest<00:00:43.890> ingredients<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
finest ingredients that we can get and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
finest ingredients that we can get and
again<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:46.140> French<00:00:46.440> chocolate<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.010> out

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
again that French chocolate is just out

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.000 
again that French chocolate is just out
of<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.610> world<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> way<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
of this world so the way we make that is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.729 
of this world so the way we make that is
we<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> mold<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.590> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
we have a mold of which we then put in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.689 
we have a mold of which we then put in
flour<00:00:54.260> vanilla<00:00:55.260> ice<00:00:55.649> cream<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> machine

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
flour vanilla ice cream from the machine

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.319 
flour vanilla ice cream from the machine
and<00:00:57.530> we<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.710> spread<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.149> can

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and we just spread it out so that we can

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.979 
and we just spread it out so that we can
leave<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> generous<00:01:01.140> portion<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.340> nice
