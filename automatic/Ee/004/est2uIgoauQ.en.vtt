 city 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.339
 change the mentality 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.960

 same entertained in taez the cgtp same company 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.929
 however, we know 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.059
 cultural artistic expressions and artists in the common people 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.230
 inns 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.390
 despite once the rcnt paternity separately in good works of art 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 this is what the pope says the papal 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.829
 currently artistic that began in the mid-1950s in the UK and the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.040
 united states that entertains 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.870
 draw in which the traditional Irishman who does not employ images of the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.420
 popular culture take them mere communication is immersed the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 perspective of the fine arts this letter to the pope 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.870
 the one that so many facets in the archangel has the practice of this sport 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.360
 is characterized by the use of themes and techniques based on live culture 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.810
 popular such as commission commercials jetas cultural 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.620
 the world before 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.600
 I look for teresa jiménez popular in opposition to future policy 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.260
 existing in art also sought to promote the respect with which is a 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.410
 cultural element often through the use of irony 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.920
 with the representative of the relevance of this Taliban movement the candidate 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 popular pp for him and so much 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.460
 in my opinion strangely the most important artist 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.930
 on the line in such pleasure 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 after day the work reflects the essence and this brings that deficits to the positions 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 Hadiza growth in the United States at that time 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.870
 is being made as such a larger decision that has been organized the 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.740
 latin american museum 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.420
 this edition is organized in collaboration denounce my father I am 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.620
 for anything full of decent work 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.670
 efe that the unemployment rate in this month 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.770

 ten installations will also be presented 14 his films in the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.629
 foundation gilberto alzate avendaño 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.840
 and taking advantage of that the Pope this artistic expression that disturbs 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.240
 especially in this task 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.080
 as you allow the mind to come to you candeleda is contacted out in each 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.160
 store is totally different let's see what the attack files say 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.030
 to this movement 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.499
 Kicanas is a stage 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:27.099
 only the pot seems to be an art that they look for is element of content for 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.669
 turn them into art 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.129
 he wants to be a millionaire 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.689
 is and you listened to time 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.430
 the sector and that holds the tribute in the city about his paintings that pin 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.599
 is here present to this type of acts 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.379
 evo in those images are like the best known of the potad and that is how the 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.450
 colors and work contracts in equality 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.880
 and when you're in detail I always worked like artists 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.860
 important numbers as the best known to work their their 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.899
 contrasts of bright colors 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.189
 unfortunately like this one 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.279
 I thank you 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.830
 Chávez has said pop art 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.520
 percent if it's something you're seeing lately that is a contrast of 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.649
 colors approaches consumerism not 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.879
 I do not know anything else but that honors these representatives is Andy Warhol who 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.389
 this ap the exhibition I think that be range agenda channels 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.309
 with this victory like him 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:19.859
 if well cultivated mind has made contrast images about 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:26.749
 we get p yellow or another power forever it's like something so adam wind 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.209
 with its somewhat simpler memory so to speak 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.069
 I think that kind of artistic expression 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.349
 the defeat 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.349
 I do not like it because there are certain things that 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.589
 as an artist because I paint I would like to learn but I do not like the 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.839
 contrast 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:48.259
 color that has aníbal recover from coffee the talented actress would be 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.769
 waiting for him to pass back to France is already here 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.269
 I took advantage of this great exhibition it is important to generate strategies 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.590
 finances translated in December interesting has to be and in the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.079
 arctic regarding its content on the other hand a strategy to accelerate 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.190
 blink 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.290
 this survey should now wait for the representative for each country 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.990
 among the works that are nationalized artistic movements that develops 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.990
 different sectors of the country 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.210
 and contextualizing what is even more, let's take an internal look at 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.439
 so interesting proposals that happens in our school and that we appreciate in 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.849
 different exhibitions showing the special area 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.539
 from subjects such as plastic arts and advertising design because in them 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.009
 We always find new products that highlight the value of the creativity of 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.009
 the poorest 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.120
 wait for the zarzuela palace 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.350
 efe for this reason for the effect of power and capacity for 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.599
 So far this emission of more than seven decades 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.779
 since the departure of the next newscast we are trying
