heart is the same games vision right we
were<00:00:54.890> starting<00:00:55.129> from<00:00:55.369> a<00:00:55.460> vision<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:55.939> then

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
were starting from a vision and then

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.570 
were starting from a vision and then
disrupt<00:00:56.989> is<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.170> very<00:00:57.409> scalable<00:00:58.010> technology

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
disrupt is a very scalable technology

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.299 
disrupt is a very scalable technology
very<00:00:59.330> scalable<00:00:59.869> game<00:01:00.080> engine<00:01:00.470> so<00:01:01.010> what<00:01:01.159> we're

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
very scalable game engine so what we're

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.429 
very scalable game engine so what we're
doing<00:01:01.339> is<00:01:01.820> we're<00:01:02.689> preserving<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.290> game

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
doing is we're preserving the game

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.500 
doing is we're preserving the game
experience<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:04.280> if<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.699> play<00:01:04.909> watch<00:01:05.119> dogs<00:01:05.360> on

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
experience but if you play watch dogs on

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.789 
experience but if you play watch dogs on
the<00:01:05.570> PlayStation<00:01:06.049> 4<00:01:06.260> we<00:01:06.380> want<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.650> make<00:01:06.770> sure

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
the PlayStation 4 we want to make sure

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.380 
the PlayStation 4 we want to make sure
that<00:01:06.979> we<00:01:07.310> use<00:01:07.460> all<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:07.970> consoles

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
that we use all of the consoles

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.960 
that we use all of the consoles
capability<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.530> all<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.189> game<00:01:10.369> spiller<00:01:10.700> were

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
capability so all the game spiller were

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.840 
capability so all the game spiller were
able<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.420> make<00:01:11.570> longer<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.830> stronger<00:01:13.130> all<00:01:13.550> of

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
able to make longer and stronger all of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.670 
able to make longer and stronger all of
the<00:01:14.000> details<00:01:14.540> in<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.840> game<00:01:15.050> were<00:01:15.230> able<00:01:15.500> to

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
the details in the game were able to

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.980 
the details in the game were able to
push<00:01:15.920> forward<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.790> have<00:01:16.970> more<00:01:17.240> details<00:01:17.450> more

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
push forward we have more details more

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.510 
push forward we have more details more
immersion<00:01:18.560> we're<00:01:18.740> able<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.160> increase

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
immersion we're able to increase

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.550 
immersion we're able to increase
connectivity<00:01:19.910> increase<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.020> density<00:01:21.200> of

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
connectivity increase the density of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.860 
connectivity increase the density of
things<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.940> same<00:01:22.970> game<00:01:23.330> experience

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
things so it's the same game experience

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.720 
things so it's the same game experience
but<00:01:24.440> basically<00:01:24.770> magnifying<00:01:25.430> on<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
but basically magnifying on the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.600 
but basically magnifying on the
PlayStation<00:01:26.240> 4<00:01:26.450> it's<00:01:27.440> not<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:27.980> a<00:01:28.070> capacity

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
PlayStation 4 it's not just a capacity

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.740 
PlayStation 4 it's not just a capacity
of<00:01:28.640> new<00:01:29.110> machinery<00:01:30.110> it's<00:01:30.560> also<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:32.150> capacity

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
of new machinery it's also the capacity

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.960 
of new machinery it's also the capacity
of<00:01:32.780> players<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.470> create<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:34.280> interact<00:01:34.760> to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
of players to create to interact to

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.850 
of players to create to interact to
socialize<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.170> when<00:01:36.290> we<00:01:36.440> started<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.830> talk

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
socialize so when we started to talk

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.030 
socialize so when we started to talk
about<00:01:37.100> watch<00:01:37.370> dogs<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.930> Sony<00:01:39.170> they<00:01:39.650> got<00:01:39.890> it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
about watch dogs to Sony they got it

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.280 
about watch dogs to Sony they got it
immediately<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.479> players<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.930> their

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
behavior that will actually bring what

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.440 
behavior that will actually bring what
next-gen<00:01:44.600> actually<00:01:45.350> means<00:01:46.060> we're<00:01:47.060> starting

people to create to think to wonder it's

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.199 
people to create to think to wonder it's
a<00:03:31.530> lot<00:03:31.709> more<00:03:31.739> than<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:32.220> pressing<00:03:32.790> buttons

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
a lot more than just pressing buttons

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.270 
a lot more than just pressing buttons
like<00:03:33.930> people<00:03:34.290> need<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.500> never<00:03:34.829> forget<00:03:35.040> that

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
like people need to never forget that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.430

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
when the player plays a game is brain is

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.650 
when the player plays a game is brain is
extremely<00:03:37.859> active<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.209> should<00:03:39.480> be

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
extremely active and you should be

the<00:03:44.069> ps4<00:03:44.370> their<00:03:45.269> job<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:46.019> always<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.859> recognize

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the ps4 their job is always to recognize

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.150 
the ps4 their job is always to recognize
that<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.880> give<00:03:48.209> more<00:03:48.959> power<00:03:49.170> for<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.650> reason

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
that and give more power for a reason

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.120 
that and give more power for a reason
like<00:03:50.549> just<00:03:50.819> provide<00:03:51.359> more<00:03:51.690> possibilities<00:03:52.530> so

like just provide more possibilities so

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.910
