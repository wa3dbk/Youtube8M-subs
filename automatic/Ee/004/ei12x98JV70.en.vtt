fascinated by the little girl and the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
fascinated by the little girl and the
pig<00:01:01.190> because<00:01:02.190> when<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.969> Korea<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.719> didn't

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
pig because when I was in Korea I didn't

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859

read<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.369> much<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.000> don't<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.479> did<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
read that much I don't think I did I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.880 
read that much I don't think I did I
wasn't<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.560> into<00:01:08.280> reading<00:01:09.680> with<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
wasn't really into reading with that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
wasn't really into reading with that
cast<00:01:11.159> started<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> fourth

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
cast started when I was in the fourth

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.170 
cast started when I was in the fourth
grade<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.110> wasn't<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.770> avid<00:01:14.460> reader<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
grade so I wasn't this avid reader it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.670 
grade so I wasn't this avid reader it
just<00:01:15.390> took<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.600> little<00:01:15.840> bit<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.170> time<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:18.680> maybe

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
just took a little bit of time and maybe

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
just took a little bit of time and maybe
later<00:01:19.920> I'll<00:01:20.220> talk<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.850> about<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
later I'll talk to you about how to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.399 
later I'll talk to you about how to
maybe<00:01:22.170> encourage<00:01:23.540> readings<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.200> have

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
maybe encourage readings if you have

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.880 
maybe encourage readings if you have
small<00:01:25.680> children<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:28.259> some<00:01:28.439> tips<00:01:28.740> on

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
small children and I have some tips on

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.399 
small children and I have some tips on
that<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.979> book<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:33.180> only<00:01:33.409> great

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that so this book is not only great

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.819 
that so this book is not only great
reading<00:01:35.220> independently<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.990> also<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.409> read

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
reading independently but also to read

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.370 
reading independently but also to read
aloud<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> small<00:01:38.790> children<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.540> every<00:01:40.170> year
