00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
errors which I did so that cost me a set

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.240 
errors which I did so that cost me a set

trying to to come in as much as i can to
the<00:01:59.820> net<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.329> attack<00:02:00.689> him<00:02:00.960> cuz<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.399> of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the net to attack him cuz this kind of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
the net to attack him cuz this kind of
style<00:02:02.790> he's<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.270> used<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> play<00:02:03.750> against<00:02:04.079> i

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
style he's not used to play against i

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.859 
style he's not used to play against i
would<00:02:04.290> say<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.250> never<00:02:05.610> easy<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.090> jump<00:02:06.689> in

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
would say and it's never easy to jump in

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.440 
would say and it's never easy to jump in
the<00:02:07.049> boat

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
the boat

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.510 
the boat
when<00:02:07.689> when<00:02:08.410> somebody<00:02:08.800> serve-and-volley<00:02:09.039> all

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
when when somebody serve-and-volley all

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.710 
when when somebody serve-and-volley all
the<00:02:09.640> time<00:02:09.819> there's<00:02:10.030> no<00:02:10.179> rhythm<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.539> he's

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
the time there's no rhythm and he's

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.020 
the time there's no rhythm and he's
returning<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.440> i<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:12.400> i<00:02:12.519> was<00:02:12.670> lucky<00:02:12.879> that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
returning and i think i was lucky that

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.430 
returning and i think i was lucky that
in<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> beginning<00:02:13.480> he<00:02:13.720> didn't<00:02:13.959> return<00:02:14.050> well

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
in the beginning he didn't return well

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.500 
in the beginning he didn't return well
so<00:02:15.160> he<00:02:15.580> was<00:02:15.700> not<00:02:15.819> really<00:02:16.000> confident<00:02:16.390> on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so he was not really confident on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.150 
so he was not really confident on
returning<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.050> stale<00:02:17.620> through<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> match

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
returning that stale through the match

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.339 
returning that stale through the match
did<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> feel<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.629> certain<00:02:19.870> point<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.290> the

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
did you feel at a certain point of the

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.070 
did you feel at a certain point of the
match<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:22.150> think<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.510> could<00:02:22.660> come<00:02:22.840> through

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
match that I think I could come through

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.080 
match that I think I could come through
and<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.379> think<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.739> could<00:02:23.980> take<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.280> yeah<00:02:24.610> those

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and I think I could take this yeah those

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.690 
and I think I could take this yeah those
bad<00:02:25.390> thoughts<00:02:25.900> are<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.500> your<00:02:26.650> mind<00:02:26.950> sometimes

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.160 
bad thoughts are in your mind sometimes
