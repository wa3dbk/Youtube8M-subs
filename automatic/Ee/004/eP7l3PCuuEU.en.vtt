00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
and since i'm just making hot chocolate

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.649 
and since i'm just making hot chocolate
I<00:03:52.060> don't<00:03:52.870> need<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.909> make<00:03:54.909> it<00:03:55.030> come<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.389> a<00:03:55.420> boil

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
I don't need to make it come to a boil

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.610 
I don't need to make it come to a boil
but<00:03:56.109> you're<00:03:56.859> probably<00:03:57.069> well<00:03:57.340> in<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.870> few<00:03:58.900> if<00:03:59.500> I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
but you're probably well in a few if I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.580 
but you're probably well in a few if I
give<00:03:59.829> it<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.129> few<00:04:00.579> more<00:04:00.730> minutes<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.590> doesn't

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
give it a few more minutes but doesn't

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.530
