 josuÃ© pela our alex north 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.009
 the priest lately criticize you a little 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.930
 but the strongest criticism has been the 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.750
 theme of guitar purchases 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.510
 improved that they are already good friends 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.490
 they taught me a musician 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.670
 I tell you something that has just been 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.060
 forgot the letter to your position is worth very 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:36.010
 let's see if the guitar and the 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.630
 song come out we are not going to continue 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.309
 have time to learn the letters 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.270
 again let's listen to the real 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.270
 alex now in front 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100
 avn 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.120
 rock rhythm we have alex lora 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.060
 dedicate this rolita to every vein 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.540
 Rocanroleras that came more than the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.540
 color loves 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.970
 all right 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.970
 I want to live 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.439
 How are you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.729
 4 more 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.750
 four goals 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.550
 Pamela is not worth it 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.550
 and later 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.000
 I 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.870
 I'm ready 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.870
 Thus 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.620
 such 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.500
 I am a happy less 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.520
 in those waters 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.520
 I'm a look 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.900
 and she 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:09.040
 when exploring he knows it waiting for him and 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.040
 screaming 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.470
 but little more throat 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.560
 a little bit of please while you 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.080
 We asked Mr. Fernando weapons of 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.660
 your evaluation please about the work 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.300
 real now forward good indeed that 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.180
 characterization is very good the 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.820
 element the guitar helps you to 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.760
 recognize more the character of alex lora 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.710
 but in the voice like it seems that you 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.200
 you pretend to beat Alex better 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.030
 I'm sorry there's a little bit of 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.730
 exaggeration and you have to control that 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.730
 subject ladies thank you very much fernando 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.950
 we went to the comment of maricarmen 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.200
 marin 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.200
 I liked how you sang today 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.009
 as a local, we are very good at 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.620
 attitude I also believe that the energy of 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.050
 the state controlling in the last gala 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.870
 it was the guitar playing that was 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.820
 bad just told me the with your friends 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.889
 teaching to play guitar but today you 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.520
 played the bass and really 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:24.310
 playing the bass also a disaster 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.039
 playing the bass not your singing all this 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.060
 well but his hand was another thing 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.070
 true that it was not the bass playing 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.310
 thank you very much mari carmen 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.820
 we listen to ricardo now yes 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.700
 Be careful to leave the cigar please 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.290
 I'm seeing that your voice is enough 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.730
 today they have small parts 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.400
 Tiny little girls here and there 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.400
 small change of letter not serious 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.360
 there is a choir I want to have thousands of 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.240
 guitars and each song that sing change 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.660
 I missed it repeat you know why I 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.440
 you say no if you know it's like that already 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.260
 I tell you is 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.730
 but there but you came back with another 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.140
 stanza equal the song is a version 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.450
 abbreviated that is, that verse could 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.250
 to have flown this care and with the voice 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.120
 now it is not as clean as other 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.200
 times 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.200
 and good 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.650
 and what of the bank if in anything I 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.820
 I know he ignores it throughout the 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.490
 history of the tri has changed from the 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.870
 guitar to the bass couple of times but not you 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.640
 it has been useful to change to you the guitar 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.870
 from below because this is a new no 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.930
 it did not do anything for the bass you have to 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.000
 take classes 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.720
 thank you very much jury gentlemen 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.820
 I ask that you please take a seat and 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.750
 you know entering www mountainous the 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.750
