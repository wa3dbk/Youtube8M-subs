00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 and very good guys dose jackman that 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.370
 Like last week in this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.290
 bongi occasion revealed in its use 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.970
 week of Thursday several of the changes 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 that will make you arms once you leave 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.469
 the 2.0 update in destination that already 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.910
 confirmed they will leave shortly before the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.070
 the one around you owned on 15 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.630
 September mentioned the changes that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.939
 all weapons will come in general and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.260
 they will also create us several exotics in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.670
 this video I will only tell you about the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.840
 changes in weapons since the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.369
 information they gave is pretty 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 I'll make a separate video for the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.090
 adjustments that to exotic grenades 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.800
 before we start telling you that boeing 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.840
 mentioned that many of the things that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 we had been complaining for months as those 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.219
 down to the spin or improve the necro and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.079
 Alan or the million raise the rifles 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.570
 automatic they know that all those 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.520
 things and more needed an adjustment but 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.750
 they saw that it would be very risky to do 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.730
 changes in the game when people 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 he started noticing them so they decided 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 solve all the problems that they had 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.250
 these weapons in a single patch is why 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 that will solve everything with the party 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 zero point so they leave on their side 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.520
 let's start first with a rifle 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.320
 automatic the goal with these weapons is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.239
 that are optimal for short in media 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.369
 distances so the changes that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.630
 Aragon would increase the base damage 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 high automatic rifles 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.189
 they said exactly when they started 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.689
 the fall of the year closer the player of 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.759
 so that they are not so effective souls 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.960
 long distance good even put 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.090
 this image so we could see that a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 short distance this rifle does 19 damage 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 and you have to get away in the middle distance 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.320
 low damage to 15 will lower it a little too 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.240
 stability to all assertive rifles 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.399
 between the optimal range of the weapon will not be 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 affected but once you enter 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.369
 long distance will be needed more 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.319
 control on the weapon to make you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.869
 precision shots and finally 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.340
 will increase base damage by 10% 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.920
 the automatic books against enemies 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 of computer that is in tve is over 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.069
 the damage that you are already increasing in 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.689
 general to what the rifles look like 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.340
 automatic will be stable again in 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.500
 the crucible but it will cost much more to do 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.390
 low to long distance continue with 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.009
 pulse rifles the goal with these weapons 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.899
 is that they are optimal at medium distance 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.640
 but that like they can be used in 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.259
 short and long distance occasions 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.569
 he also wants to increase the effectiveness 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.979
 of these weapons in tve so the 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.200
 changes of these are to reduce the damage 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.840
 base of all the pulse rifles with 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.759
 cadence of average shot in a 2.5 per 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.090
 hundred as well as the death messenger 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.780
 red in bp with these weapons you can kill 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.550
 to an enemy 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.200
 2 to 3 direct bursts in the head 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.090
 depending on the state of armor in the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.550
 another player will also lower it a bit 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.080
 the stability all just to make it 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.270
 a little more expensive to have the three 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.920
 bursts in the head and also you 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.260
 will increase the ammunition in cartridge all 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.910
 pulse rate all this to level a 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.800
 little the price of pulse since in this 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.180
 at the moment they are very used leaving aside a 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.730
 all players who use hawthorn 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.200
 then we have the rifles explorer the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.580
 goal with these is that it is the best 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.680
 primary weapon option for long 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.930
 distances so the changes will be 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.459
 increase base damage on the rifles 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.820
 explorers who have a cadence 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.410
 fast in pp this will not affect the time to 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.720
 Kill an enemy that has life 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.630
 complete will increase the ammunition in the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.580
 cartridge of all rifles explorer 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.130
 will reduce the accuracy when shooting 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.200
 without aiming and will increase the damage by 5% 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.819
 against computers in general what 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.500
 are doing with these is that if 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.870
 you choose a rifle the tester is so that 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.670
 play half long distances 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.590
 the last primary are the cannons of 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 hand the goal with these is that they are 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.880
 optimal at short and medium distances that 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.620
 the hand cannons are good when 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.470
 thousand points his shots instead of shoots 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.270
 quickly so the changes will be 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.040
 the damage fall closer the player 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.240
 so that they lose effectiveness long 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.520
 distance as well as rifles 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.890
 automatic a small reduction of 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.890
 precision when aiming will also reduce 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.850
 the accuracy when shooting from the hip 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.410
 will reduce cartridge ammunition in 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.720
 all genres of hand possibly to 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.910
 1 to 2 bullets told us as soon as 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.440
 I think it will not be much and they will reduce 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.690
 little the zoom or approach when 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.590
 we aim with hand guns 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.330
 personally I think these changes 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.620
 they were unnecessary since the guns of 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.270
 hand they were at a good point in the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.700
 I play the only ones that needed a 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.160
 fit were the three exotics who like 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.140
 they are also affecting them by following 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.670
 now with the shotguns the goal with this 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.370
 it has always been that they are weapons 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.720
 effective very short distances and that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.700
 complement with the body attack to 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.190
 body so the changes that they will make are 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.690
 the pÃ©rez or advantages that improve the 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.280
 range of shotguns will be reduced 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.180
 in shotguns that already come with a high 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.390
 rank 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.790
 jk will be reduced by 30% and range 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.760
 finder 'will now increase the range by 5% 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.169
 when before it was 20% these are both 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.310
 dogs that most people tried to 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.440
 get for their shotguns only 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.390
 comment the range will also reduce the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.920
 damage to precision shooting 10% 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.930
 with the shotguns and he 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.940
 against computers in 10 too 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.890
 will reduce remember that in the last 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.930
 shotgun patch increased them on 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.450
 damage in bp or against computers in 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.430
 100% now it would go down by 10 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.110
 a hundred I think these changes are 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.420
 well especially considering all 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.160
 the complaints that had the shotguns with 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.080
 I tend with the fusion rifles the goal 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.430
 with lists is that they are optimal to average 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.530
 distance when we can follow the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.000
 enemies in motion but not so close 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.070
 as to attack while loading the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.810
 rifle with these weapons requires power 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.550
 predict where the enemy will move 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.740
 so the changes are the rifles of 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.200
 merger that they charge slow but they have high 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.090
 impact will reduce them in the stop range 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.490
 it will make it more difficult to maximize the range in 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.590
 these weapons the lightning speed will be 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.270
 reduced a bit will improve the accuracy 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.460
 in fusion rifles with short range 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.410
 and will reduce the accuracy in the rifles of 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.120
 merge with high rank all these 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.370
 changes are to focus the use of these 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.110
 weapons half distances from last 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.910
 special with snipers the 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.740
 goal with this has always been to be 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.330
 optimal weapons over long distances and 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.520
 difficult to use half and short 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.170
 distances the only change they will receive 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.880
 will be with respect to the final advantage 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.140
 round last shot that lets you kill 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.920
 of a shot in any part of the body 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.290
 with the last card bullet 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.030
 this now only the damage comes with the 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.770
 precision shots so basically 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.210
 will be useless in the crucible since the 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.400
 snipers call where a shot in 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.410
 head to the other players this 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.820
 change is mostly for the complaints 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.350
 that some players made about 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.040
 snipers with was in the round that the 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.200
 own irises 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.760
 I always know this strategy and even 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.980
 he recommended it to me in my advice video 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.170
 to osiris so basically not 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.940
 we can use the end round to kill 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.040
 a friend of a single shot once with 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.570
 this patch the truth I do not have any 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.730
 problem with removing it I think it's 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.410
 more just like that and the last one with the 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.360
 changes in weapons are in the courts 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.370
 good if you will not make changes with the 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.930
 heavy machine guns the goal with the 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.630
 they make rockets is they do damage 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.730
 massive in one area and they are optimal 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.160
 when they point to the center of a group 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.090
 the changes will increase a bit the 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.470
 radius of the explosion to all 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.990
 rocket launcher that would be essentially 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.180
 increase the damage but it will reduce a bit 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.800
 the gration horses parc that makes 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.350
 the rocket launcher exploits proximity 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.690
 it is the same they will do it but it will require that 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.010
 the enemy is closer lately 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.230
 many used sequencing 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.610
 crucible for this but to reduce it me 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.529
 It seems like a good idea to balance more 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.419
 the heavy weapons in the crucible 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.429
 those are all the changes that will come to 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.229
 the weapons in the 5 in the match point 0 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:45.939
 as I told you the patch will come out 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.369
 early September just before 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:50.349
 the expansion on top of these there are certain 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:52.419
 exotic like the Spinola faces with the 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.369
 necro case among others that will also be 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:56.319
 adjusted the video with the champions 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:57.549
 exotic I will not go up after this one 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.409
 that if they want channel to see what it brings 

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:02.019
 the adjustments they made are pretty 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.519
 great in general is that the guys this 

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:05.109
 it's true for this video I hope that you 

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:06.699

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:08.589
