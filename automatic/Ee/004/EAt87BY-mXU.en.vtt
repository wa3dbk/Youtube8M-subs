00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
want to call him and my friend lucky
decided<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> throw<00:00:50.579> her<00:00:50.820> needs<00:00:51.030> over<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> edge

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
decided to throw her needs over the edge

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.450 
decided to throw her needs over the edge
in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> direction<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.680> tear<00:00:52.890> amorphous<00:00:53.280> where

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
in the direction of tear amorphous where

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.950 
in the direction of tear amorphous where
he<00:00:53.579> comes<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> gate<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:54.780> goes

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
he comes out of the gate and then goes

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.520 
he comes out of the gate and then goes
underwater

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
underwater

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
underwater
so<00:00:56.070> naturally<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> decided<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> same

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
so naturally I decided to do the same

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
so naturally I decided to do the same
thing<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.800> modded<00:00:59.190> grenades<00:00:59.489> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
thing and I have modded grenades that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.819 
thing and I have modded grenades that
one<00:00:59.879> hit<00:01:00.090> everything<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:01.410> spawn<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the child grenades and as you'll see in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.740 
the child grenades and as you'll see in
a<00:01:03.660> second<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.949> 18,000<00:01:05.729> XP<00:01:06.030> pops<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
a second like 18,000 XP pops up which is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.030 
a second like 18,000 XP pops up which is
how<00:01:06.869> much<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.170> get<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.530> killing<00:01:07.650> tear

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
how much you get for killing tear

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
how much you get for killing tear
amorphous<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.170> you'll<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
amorphous and you'll see it right in a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
amorphous and you'll see it right in a
second<00:01:11.070> right<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.909> XP<00:01:12.240> pops<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.720> for

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
modded and as you can see here tear
amorphous<00:01:26.460> still<00:01:26.670> spawned<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.210> normal<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.780> we

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
amorphous still spawned as normal and we

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.590 
amorphous still spawned as normal and we
still<00:01:28.140> got<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> same<00:01:28.970> 18,500<00:01:29.970> whatever<00:01:30.210> XP

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
still got the same 18,500 whatever XP

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870 
still got the same 18,500 whatever XP
from<00:01:30.869> killing<00:01:31.500> him<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.579> thought<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
from killing him so I just thought it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.249 
from killing him so I just thought it
wasn't<00:01:33.030> interesting<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.810> funny<00:01:34.020> glitch

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
wasn't interesting kind of funny glitch

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660 
wasn't interesting kind of funny glitch
and<00:01:34.500> since<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.829> were<00:01:34.979> still<00:01:35.189> legitimately

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and since we were still legitimately

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
and since we were still legitimately
leveling<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.390> did<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.720> every<00:01:36.960> single

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
leveling off we did this every single

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.890 
leveling off we did this every single
time<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.189> double<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.549> XP<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.570> anyway

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
time to get double the XP but anyway

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.940 
time to get double the XP but anyway
guys<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.409> much<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:40.829> this

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
guys that's pretty much it for this

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.649 
guys that's pretty much it for this
video<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> again<00:01:41.640> obviously<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.270> can't<00:01:42.509> take

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
video and again obviously you can't take

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.359 
video and again obviously you can't take
advantage<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.350> glitch<00:01:43.649> unless<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.130> have

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
advantage of this glitch unless you have

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
advantage of this glitch unless you have
modded<00:01:45.299> grenades<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.840> modded<00:01:46.229> bonus<00:01:46.500> stats

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
modded grenades or modded bonus stats

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
modded grenades or modded bonus stats
that<00:01:46.890> make<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.399> hit<00:01:47.549> everything<00:01:47.790> with

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that make you one hit everything with

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
that make you one hit everything with
your<00:01:48.180> grenades<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.990> again<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:49.680> pretty

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
your grenades but again that's pretty

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.960 
your grenades but again that's pretty
much<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> hope<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> guys<00:01:50.549> enjoyed<00:01:50.850> the
