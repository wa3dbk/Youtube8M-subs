00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.039
 Hello my dear viewers with you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.150
 alexander and 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:22.039
 this is not freddy kruger's hand this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.329
 dinosaurs i call them shiz briks 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.509
 they are quite good but happy but 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.849
 very very very very simple 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.570
 here are such dinosaurs here they are all 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.040
 with open mouth rubbed at first glance 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.449
 it may seem that they are all very 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.940
 same and this is true yes but they are on 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.049
 really represents a very very 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.250
 different types of dinosaurs see here 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:52.199
 it is with us they are even all signed 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.720
 written maid yin tea written here 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.920
 what is it allosaurus 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.360
 so here we have a beautiful Allosaurus 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.369
 this is probably our way you could 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.369
 guess this is our spinosaurus 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.130
 Spinosaurus so this is probably the most 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.220
 most difficult to guess what that 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.610
 dinosaur and well let's see it doesn't 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.890
 rat is a dinosaur and give you a little 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.220
 a clue but something for his finger 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.110
 such sticks out on magic and yes you are right it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.770
 of course make raptor velociraptor 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.060
 their legs stick out like that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.090
 big claws on hind legs so well this 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.720
 I think no doubt all hijacked it right away 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.550
 we have a spinosaur 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.070
 they also have another winner of this 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.720
 crest that creeps on four legs 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.229
 it's of course 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.940
 dimetrodone who told you in 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.740
 chap mei series 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.150
 he met with us in a very similar way 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.590
 you know, even though they are 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.810
 made as if very simple they are real 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.909
 that is, they have all the signs exactly 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.599
 those dinosaurs on which they should 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.709
 be like yes and and of course of course 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.239
 velociraptor which is more like 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.819
 style on some rat 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.430
 they all really look like on 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.090
 who does not look like let's in detail 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 Consider the spinosaur us a tax you 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.260
 made a reservation 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.630
 This of course stegosaurus this not affected and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.650
 for tomorrow for a spinosaur this here we have it 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:37.130
 and here is the spout compared with Allosaurus 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.459
 Esaulov for the thief that we have well paws 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.400
 made differently like a spinosaur knife like 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.739
 a little taller weiss comb of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.580
 frosted for in equals here from such 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.140
 bump on the nose is like a little rock 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.840
 this is not a defect this is really not true 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.739
 wanted to do 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.260
 coloring them by the way surprisingly 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.780
 normal she gets there where you want 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.540
 everyone's eyes are very much in place 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.380
 just take the water as you were 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.910
 dinosaurs but 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:16.510
 but everything should be there but again soo lessons 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:19.310
 in his arms gave all dinosaurs for joy 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.530
 all stratos is not all hollow inside but 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.049
 they are solid that is to keep them here 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:30.760
 look very very very difficult honest 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:34.430
 saying I don't know what the idea is 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.390
 maybe they should dress somewhere well 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.519
 here let's say that's possible and spinosaurus 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.519
 pencil shove no can 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:55.960
 no maybe it is so necessary then they need it 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:05.520
 fraternal help like this is not exactly 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:05.520
 all were able to do something like this 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.270
 to give 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.560
 Here is a train is obtained 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.050
 this is how they can be this I realized what 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.080
 idea is 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.090
 this is not dinosaurs this is a constructor this 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.040
 we are Dina designer so here you can 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.230
 By the way, I noticed one and all blind 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.889
 thing so on spinosaur on one side 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.889
 Crash 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.100
 this is bochin 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.430
 here I am disappointed though not though 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.450
 no, everything is fine and not to change 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:58.200
 let's say three times bricks 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:02.090
 well for briks they are very simple but 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.660
 in this and their small plus they just 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.440
 original and funny 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.240
 not generally they liked them without without 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.100
 taste without color without smell that is they 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.440
 as if with rubber bands stinking there is nothing 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.260
 no smear anywhere on hand 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.169
 do not seem to be in the bad section 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.080
 toys I did not send it to the can because 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.190
 that i just love dinosaurs 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:32.010
 Well, in general, here we have such 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.810
