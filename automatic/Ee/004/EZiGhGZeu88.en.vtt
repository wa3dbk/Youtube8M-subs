stayed in it whistle to whistle and i

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
stayed in it whistle to whistle and i
thought<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.920> cool<00:01:53.189> they

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
thought that was really really cool they

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
thought that was really really cool they
look<00:01:53.850> under<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> cosh<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> first<00:01:55.259> 20

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
look under the cosh for the first 20

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.980 
look under the cosh for the first 20
minutes<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.310> start<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> settle<00:01:57.659> into

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
minutes and then start to settle into

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.560 
minutes and then start to settle into
the<00:01:58.079> game<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.670> it's<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the game so we know it's going to be a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.480 
the game so we know it's going to be a
tough<00:02:01.380> match<00:02:01.439> not<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.939> much

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
tough match not know much

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.880 
tough match not know much
national<00:02:03.820> level<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.119> easy<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.960> think<00:02:05.020> for

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
national level is easy and I think for

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.230 
national level is easy and I think for
us<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.159> know<00:02:06.430> what<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.729> want<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.970> get<00:02:07.090> out<00:02:07.210> of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.809 
this game three points and with any luck
we<00:02:11.110> get<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.349> chance<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.800> rest<00:02:12.010> some<00:02:12.160> players<00:02:12.459> as

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
we get a chance to rest some players as

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.850 
we get a chance to rest some players as
well<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.180> score<00:02:13.959> some<00:02:14.170> goals<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.650> that's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
that's right at the forefront of our

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.780 
that's right at the forefront of our
minds<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.709> can't<00:02:17.950> take<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.280> game<00:02:18.430> lightly
