00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
under DA then you have double and this

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.430 
under DA then you have double and this
is<00:02:29.650> an<00:02:29.799> exciting<00:02:30.129> one<00:02:30.549> for<00:02:30.579> me<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:31.329> is<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:32.260> me

is an exciting one for me this is for me
for<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.040> musicality<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> dynamics<00:02:35.709> of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
for the musicality for the dynamics of

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.599 
for the musicality for the dynamics of
the<00:02:36.459> muscles<00:02:37.680> again<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:39.190> start<00:02:39.489> with<00:02:39.519> a
