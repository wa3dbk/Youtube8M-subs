00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.700
 cool pokemon x and pokemon news 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.309
 and as you see on the screen you have a fan 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.150
 may of this is a fan art that can be 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.760
 possible pokemon character x and the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.980
 true that the one who does this two were 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.720
 these things are so pretty here curra 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.480
 As you can see, he has put the thumbnail that 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.310
 be in the trailer and good is the boy not 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.120
 has also put down here under 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.619
 level such and the bastard to the ct then he 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.409
 it happens not enough to do that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.780
 be real I do not know with what this as you see 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:37.760
 like the old ones, evolution is not 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.219
 of fene king already well done more so for 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.940
 to say is like these from the same one 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.909
 take us brought more orphans of possible 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.280
 new pokemon this the evolution of 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.960
 way that divides 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.340
 to an evolution of production of 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.470
 televise 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.390
 The truth is that there are quite a few costs 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.430
 online if you look here you see this 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.250
 it is quite handsome evolution of the doctor 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.250
 very exaggerated but good has its 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.960
 dot there the evolution of since what 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.800
 surpasses what the turtle is called that 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.900
 nobody uses 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.660
 the truth that there are many things in this 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.590
 espn evolution so much this one does not 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.720
 it could be that they had evolution 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.540
 also from what actor is very pretty to me 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.190
 I really like this I do not know has never been 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.530
 Capture fan but is is handsome 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.840
 I would also angus I would like a 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.280
 exactly evolution of angus prince 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.040
 this one not because I do not like it very much but 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.950
 would be fine then there is that I guess 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.590
 is what makes it pretty cool to a little 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.450
 also very aggressive not good here 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.460
 you have until you are sorry but it is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.260
 very ugly not where the three monkeys 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.650
 similes of why a black and white very 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.270
 ugly 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.460
 and good the extra evolution of this a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.080
 kilo of stock and not 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.050
 I do not remember in the new law do not have 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 in account and here more dave revolutions and 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.080
 as surely none is already you know 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.590
 more apart from they serve for rock's 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.580
 poison type there was also now one of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.680
 manuel I remember this guy I guess 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.229
 it's flying type not because of having hair 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.320
 it's weird is that the bear that now had 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.420
 taken out is only land-type lion 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.050
 I guess I do not know the truth 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.580
 they are pretty cool all this 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.610
 it seems a little bit worse it has not been in the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.489
 same lilac color but good all fan 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.280
 arts is fake I always say it too 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.780
 this looks a lot like a veron like that 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.720
 is saying that space is worth not 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.970
 tell this lie I do not know what 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.060
 it means that it is a lie that he has done it 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.560
 the fanatical facts of pokemon and good 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.860
 here we have the evolution of tanger to 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.510
 other revolutions this revolution 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.920
 of the liquid although it could do 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.860
 now also my car a little ugly 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.130
 but why not attitude to him by 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.840
 imagination 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.190
 here we have one that could evolve 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.240
 in half in wat auroux according to 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.060
 male or female a console revolution 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.180
 very people are bored a lot and gives them 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.340
 for doing these things giraffe pressure 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.340
 a little ugly also the bastard 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.290
 imagination have an evolution of 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.930
 torquay I preferred it to be this 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.380
 revolution would use an evolution and 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.690
 We have two audi revolutions, not one 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.760
 arsenal and do not be coming to lille to 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.010
 be like that, well and good and here it is 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.100
 preventions and geely pretty cool no 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.320
 is could be no and well now by 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.380
 last I bring you possible legendary 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.740
 what people have done and we have to lower the 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.700
 fire to the three is the one that has most 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.810
 liked the four there are I do not know the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.630
 people I already say that he gets bored a lot and makes 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.730
 many pokemon then we have this 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.239
 turtle species although you could not 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.690
 be of water dragon or water rock type 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.120
 he 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.310
 pretty good they are cured the truth 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.770
 but hey, I do not think they'll be 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.570
 pokemon similar this is already passed a 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.540
 little is no longer very similar to a pokÃ©mon 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.140
 the truth and that it looks a lot like no 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.970
 bakugan of these and finally this that 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.220
 you're going now that's the least I 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.289
 like because it looks typical dragon 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.110
 Japanese this here 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.270

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.009
