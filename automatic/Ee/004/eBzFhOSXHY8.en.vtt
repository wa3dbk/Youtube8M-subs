00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.980
 hello good morning here we are with the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.690
 Forza Horizon gameplay if you remember 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.630
 we leave it right on the first mission 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.340
 that we went to the mechanic and then he told us 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.730
 already to do the first mission here we 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.410
 said to mark the GPS map of the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.410
 circuit I want to do 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.990
 I forgot to say 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.390
 today was the scala in a channel of a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.770
 hit and now you can tune the three 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.770
 harrison stations 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.149
 it happened to me 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.149
 then you can register 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.410
 but to sign up 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.360
 the horizon that from our first 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.360
 to qualify for your first doll 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.299
 to enter the event 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.880
 this would also be like the first 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.549
 race that we did comes the first of 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 the three so that the pass for the 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.490
 career 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.960
 I do not know what will happen if you do not get that 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.960
 They say do not pass 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.270
 if you have disable the helps goes to 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.490
 increase the life of your rivals you can 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.840
 do it in the difficulty menu and also 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.840
 they will earn money with it 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.830
 it seems that this race if I'm going to 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.370
 win because look at the cars there 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.370
 so let's go 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 outside lad 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.390
 in the middle 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.870
 in the first three came the first 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.870
 I mean, it was not that decent either 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.420
 and checkered flag 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.890
 although the first orizonia race 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.700
 another side the first days get 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.810
 a victory 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.000
 by winning the first nolito race 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.500
 has completed his first race not 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.500
 list of achievements 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.520
 here as you see the bunch the festivals 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.470
 but we go 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.150
 but you do not start tomorrow 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.000
 but I have an exhibition event in the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.849
 that I would like participants 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.909
 the public is waiting for you 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.300
 well what I will do now will be to go there 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:54.370
 As you can see, I have a good stretch 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.110
 and until there and on arrival I will cut and already in 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.970
 the next video I will do the next 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.970
 career doing career by race 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.580
 as you see, he lets us go on the road 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.580
 it's also a good point of that 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.640
 highway 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.659
 we have gone through everything red 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.249
 when it sees blue or goes through as fast 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.509
 that you can save is our greatest 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.509
 speed in each 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.410
 106 per hour 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.640
 these will be challenges that will be giving 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.380
 to this advance 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.130
 here as you see me police or not 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.130
 we can talk 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.780
 sapag host with the road 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.230
 the truth as I told you the graphics 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.820
 incredible 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.820
 giant the background 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:09.600
 hands in the area 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.400
 illegals 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.880
 it is not clear if they also want 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.360
 to participate I am in the mood to go up with more 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.360
 music 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.470
 what's happening here 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.330
 I wanted to do it from the cni for speed that 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.009
 you were leaving for the guardrail broke and 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.439
 you shut up in the ravine 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.949
 here, as you can see, we are not going to fall 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.949
 shell 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:49.790
 as I told you when you get here I would stop it 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.790
 then I will go towards the race 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.780
 and is that what you liked and that 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.280
 keep encouraging us to watch the videos of 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.280
 hard goodbye
