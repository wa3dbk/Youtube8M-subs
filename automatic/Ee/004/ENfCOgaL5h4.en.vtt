Ole<00:03:28.120> Miss<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.980> think<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.130> was<00:03:30.280> about<00:03:30.400> two

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.510 
Ole Miss I think that was about two
thousand<00:03:31.330> two<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:32.020> get<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.710> years<00:03:32.950> confused

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520

the next one was Arkansas at Kentucky

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.190 
the next one was Arkansas at Kentucky
and<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.370> think<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.820> was<00:03:36.970> about<00:03:37.060> 2,000<00:03:37.930> for

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200

and I think that was about 2,000 for
both<00:03:38.680> times<00:03:39.310> went<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.850> 70<00:03:40.390> tease<00:03:40.720> both<00:03:41.380> times
