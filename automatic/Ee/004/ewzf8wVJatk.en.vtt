00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
sense I'm sure somebody will try putting

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.520 
sense I'm sure somebody will try putting
it<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> comments<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.200> me<00:02:37.320> it

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
it down in the comments but to me it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
it down in the comments but to me it
makes<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.800> lot<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:37.980> sense<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.400> obviously<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
makes a lot of sense and obviously to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.970 
makes a lot of sense and obviously to
others<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.480> does<00:02:39.660> too<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.680> something<00:02:40.890> to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
others it does too just something to

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.740 
others it does too just something to
note<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.520> let's<00:02:41.910> get<00:02:42.030> down<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.330> actual

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
note and let's get down to the actual

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.800 
note and let's get down to the actual
proof<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> Samuel<00:02:44.850> quote<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.720> he

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
proof so there is a Samuel quote that he

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.330 
proof so there is a Samuel quote that he
talks<00:02:46.050> about<00:02:46.140> Atlantis<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:46.890> transit<00:02:47.280> I'm

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
talks about Atlantis and transit I'm

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.090 
talks about Atlantis and transit I'm
going<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.520> throw<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.940> now<00:02:51.710> so<00:02:52.710> nothing

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
going to throw that up now so nothing

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.740 
going to throw that up now so nothing
really<00:02:53.130> there<00:02:53.580> all<00:02:53.790> he<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:53.940> says<00:02:54.360> as<00:02:54.570> he

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750

i'm gonna i'm going to struggle saying
this<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.470> probably<00:03:34.620> gonna<00:03:34.830> bomb<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> name<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
this is probably gonna bomb the name the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.000 
this is probably gonna bomb the name the
Antikythera<00:03:36.600> mechanism<00:03:36.900> okay<00:03:37.620> i<00:03:37.650> didn't<00:03:37.890> bomb

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
Antikythera mechanism okay i didn't bomb

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.220 
Antikythera mechanism okay i didn't bomb
it<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.310> much<00:03:38.460> as<00:03:38.490> I<00:03:38.730> thought<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
it as much as I thought but the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.200 
it as much as I thought but the
mechanism<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.310> guys<00:03:41.490> are<00:03:41.700> not<00:03:41.880> aware<00:03:42.150> of

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
mechanism if you guys are not aware of

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.180 
mechanism if you guys are not aware of
this<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:42.960> an<00:03:43.110> analog<00:03:43.530> computer<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.069> was

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
this it's an analog computer that was

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.030 
this it's an analog computer that was
used<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.670> find<00:03:44.940> astronomer<00:03:45.870> chol<00:03:46.050> positions

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
used to find astronomer chol positions

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.290 
used to find astronomer chol positions
think<00:03:47.340> about<00:03:47.490> that<00:03:47.580> astronomer<00:03:48.150> chol

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
think about that astronomer chol

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.380 
think about that astronomer chol
positions

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
positions

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.770 
positions
now<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.450> realize<00:03:51.930> he<00:03:52.440> as<00:03:52.560> they<00:03:52.710> can<00:03:52.890> theremin

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
now to realize he as they can theremin

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.770 
now to realize he as they can theremin
just<00:03:54.780> kidding<00:03:55.170> but<00:03:55.830> again<00:03:56.240> look<00:03:57.240> it<00:03:57.360> down<00:03:57.510> I

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
just kidding but again look it down I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.420 
just kidding but again look it down I
mean<00:03:59.569> George<00:04:00.680> could<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.800> possibly<00:04:02.040> leave

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
mean George could this possibly leave

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.610 
mean George could this possibly leave
the<00:04:02.610> way<00:04:02.850> we<00:04:03.090> connect<00:04:03.510> back<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.810> moon<00:04:04.140> that's

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
the way we connect back to moon that's

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.199 
the way we connect back to moon that's
what<00:04:04.830> i<00:04:04.860> was<00:04:05.100> thinking<00:04:05.160> i'm<00:04:05.610> not<00:04:05.819> sure<00:04:06.030> that's

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
what i was thinking i'm not sure that's

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.510 
what i was thinking i'm not sure that's
maybe<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.570> crazy<00:04:07.020> thing<00:04:07.320> I'm<00:04:07.440> saying<00:04:07.740> I<00:04:07.950> just

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
maybe a crazy thing I'm saying I just

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.490 
maybe a crazy thing I'm saying I just
thought<00:04:08.700> instantly<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:09.930> has<00:04:10.140> there<00:04:10.380> maybe

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
thought instantly that has there maybe

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.110 
thought instantly that has there maybe
there's<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:10.830> link<00:04:11.040> there<00:04:11.130> from<00:04:11.459> an<00:04:11.550> Atlantis<00:04:11.970> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
there's a link there from an Atlantis to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.630 
there's a link there from an Atlantis to
moon<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:13.050> that's<00:04:13.560> just<00:04:13.709> my<00:04:14.130> little<00:04:14.310> thing<00:04:14.550> and

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
moon so that's just my little thing and

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.069 
moon so that's just my little thing and
a<00:04:14.700> lot<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:14.940> people<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.209> been<00:04:15.240> discussing<00:04:15.720> the

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
a lot of people have been discussing the

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.159 
a lot of people have been discussing the
fear<00:04:16.350> teddy<00:04:16.680> because<00:04:17.489> obviously<00:04:18.030> transit<00:04:18.930> and

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
fear teddy because obviously transit and

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.020 
fear teddy because obviously transit and
then<00:04:19.320> there's<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.859> ending<00:04:20.220> letters<00:04:20.730> of

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
then there's the ending letters of

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.949 
then there's the ending letters of

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
detailed with that because most you guys

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.330 
detailed with that because most you guys
already<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.810> but<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.530> fear<00:04:25.680> teddy<00:04:26.010> the

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
already know that but the fear teddy the

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.190 
already know that but the fear teddy the
question<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.760> what<00:04:27.000> will<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.330> map<00:04:27.510> name<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:27.990> if

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
question is what will the map name is if

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.220 
question is what will the map name is if
it<00:04:28.890> is<00:04:29.040> just<00:04:29.280> Atlantis<00:04:29.880> could<00:04:30.630> we<00:04:30.780> see<00:04:31.020> maybe

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
it is just Atlantis could we see maybe

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.290 
it is just Atlantis could we see maybe
the<00:04:31.410> Atlantis<00:04:31.860> being<00:04:32.100> named<00:04:32.280> something<00:04:33.090> like

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
the Atlantis being named something like

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.480 
the Atlantis being named something like
sunken<00:04:34.200> city<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.530> saw<00:04:34.770> somebody<00:04:34.950> write<00:04:35.250> that

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
sunken city I saw somebody write that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.100 
sunken city I saw somebody write that
just<00:04:36.120> wanted<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.480> note<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.720> because<00:04:37.080> that

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
just wanted to note that because that

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.570 
just wanted to note that because that
definitely<00:04:37.350> sounded<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.130> little<00:04:38.280> bit<00:04:38.430> right

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
definitely sounded a little bit right

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.250 
definitely sounded a little bit right
because<00:04:38.910> if<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.210> guys<00:04:39.330> think<00:04:39.360> about<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:39.810> they

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
because if you guys think about it they

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.350 
because if you guys think about it they
don't<00:04:40.440> name<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.820> exactly<00:04:41.820> like<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.060> location

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
don't name it exactly like the location

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.970 
don't name it exactly like the location
like<00:04:42.690> think<00:04:42.900> about<00:04:42.930> Alcatraz<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.710> wasn't

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
like think about Alcatraz it wasn't

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.350 
like think about Alcatraz it wasn't
called<00:04:44.130> Alcatraz<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.700> was<00:04:44.790> called<00:04:45.000> mob<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.330> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
called Alcatraz it was called mob of the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.510 
called Alcatraz it was called mob of the
dead<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.720> if<00:04:46.320> Atlantis<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.950> coming<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.370> could

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
dead and if Atlantis is coming it could

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.550 
dead and if Atlantis is coming it could
be<00:04:47.640> just<00:04:47.760> called<00:04:48.030> sunken<00:04:48.450> city<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.440> that's

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
be just called sunken city so that's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.810 
be just called sunken city so that's
definitely<00:04:49.800> something<00:04:50.130> interesting<00:04:50.640> one

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
definitely something interesting one

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.730 
definitely something interesting one
dimension<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.480> guys<00:04:52.050> this<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.470> some<00:04:52.620> pretty
