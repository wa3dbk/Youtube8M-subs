00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.569
 hello very welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.999
 good I continue with the review of 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:11.050
 applications root applications for 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:13.090
 superuser permissions and good today I'm going 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.269
 to use an application that is 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.300
 really interesting 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.180
 those that have Chinese phones 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.740
 it is because you will have the capacity of 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 internal storage of the phone is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.900
 quite scarce in this case in my case 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.489
 that I have a support 2 platinum of 32 gb 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.750
 comes with internal storage 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.370
 total of 1 with 5 gigas quite scarce 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 for what applications are today 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 in day and no longer the applications themselves 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.839
 but the data they store in total 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
 agree that many applications are 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.879
 can happen to the sd but so many 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.250
 like google apps to not be 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.640
 that you have a resignation, not people or other 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.380
 Similary 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.520
 then you can not pass them completely 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.739
 to the sd card this solution then 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.170
 solution I think the best with this 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.960
 application has developed a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.850
 user who are called media is 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.700
 hosted on dual sim in the dual sim forum 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.270
 I put the link below for you 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.400
 have a tutorial that you have the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.160
 link of the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.720
 of the program in question and so that if 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.520
 you have to ask any question 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.240
 you can do to the developer 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.230
 directly 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.810
 josh for clarifying the doubts 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.030
 that arise if it is in my hand and if not 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.950
 because what is said here, you will have the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.440
 official link for you to consult 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.230
 directly with the developer well 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 what does this application do in principle 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.730
 This application is designed to 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.890
 devices up to 16 gb of rom voucher 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.250
 As you can see here all the sections 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.500
 they refer to 16 gb of rom as 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.590
 you heard at the beginning of my video 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.120
 phone has 32 gigs and still good 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.440
 knowing that could risk to 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.770
 do it and it has gone well 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.790
 we have also tested it on a c3 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.220
 and it has also gone well and good 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.340
 It is compatible with enough devices 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.620
 as long as the processor is the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.070
 mtk from mediatek mtk 65 89 is worth this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.610
 program is exclusive for this type of 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.830
 processor 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 Well once 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.290
 that enter what you said you will see 1.5 gb that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.630
 is what comes by default in case of 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.850
 that you have some modification if then 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.580
 you want to go back to 1.5 GB for the theme that 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.160
 be well for guarantee well because we 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.410
 convinces me that I am surprised that this is the case 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.090
 or for any other reason because always 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.850
 you can go back to the original partition 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.470
 that is one and a half giga is worth like that 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.230
 it's not what interests us that really 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.140
 what we want is more space 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.910
 I in my case I pressed five gigas I 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.600
 I have made a partition of 5 gigs inside 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.520
 of the 32 that I have of rom is worth this 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.870
 last option that comes here from 7 with 13 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.800
 gigas is unique and exclusive for 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.200
 devices with 16 gb of ram only and 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.020
 exclusively for devices with 16 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.510
 ram gb I've done in the attempt to 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.490
 try it clear that is 6 gigs 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.310
 neither because I believe that with 5 gb in 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.810
 my case I think it 's more than enough 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.310
 In case it was not, we'll go back 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.440
 to execute the program and ready 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.330
 to the point the only thing we would have to 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.920
 do here would be to select the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.190
 partition that we want to do in my case 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.300
 would be 5 gigs and confirm the selection 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.350
 it's worth once you have the confidence 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.270
 selected confirmation 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.890
 I do not remember what the program does 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.730
 that does not do exactly anything is 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.910
 just confirm and tell him 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.280
 restart in recovery mode voucher 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.610
 you start in recovery mode see you in 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.300
 the recovery and we continue with the with the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.300
 end of the program 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.850
 well we are restarting the terminal in 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.819
 recovery mode 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.120
 I use tvr t 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.730
 those who use clock world mod too 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.049
 will be worth exactly the same and here a 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.370
 once inside the recovery the only thing that 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.970
 we would have to do would be to go to 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.780
 paragraph of wight and in white make a 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.639
 Factor and reset is worth once you're 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.910
 made him 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.060
 the factor and reset 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.540
 let's see we would go inside the section 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.090
 of while we would go to intern is thorax 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.600
 ok that would be the internal storage 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.280
 of the phone and what we'll get 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.320
 that we have left according to the capacity that 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.020
 have thus exposed within the memory 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.400
 internal that would be this here is worth 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.520
 according to the ability is that you there 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.470
 placed within the program of getting 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.120
 obviously I forgive you 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.810
 Nothing here will leave you the rest 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.880
 Once you have done all the whites 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:06.790
 it would simply restart 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.480
 we restart in system 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.040
 and we continue with the focus 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.320
 well, we're back from the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.249
 recovery we have done all the whites 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.379
 necessary to 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:22.359
 perform the operation correctly on 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.719
 factor and reset and then the internal 

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:26.979
 election is valid and the only thing that remains 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.769
 is to check why the operation has 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:33.680
 come out correctly we would go on this 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:36.169
 case to storage settings 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.940
 good we see that we already have here 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.100
 available the 5 gigas that we have 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.960
 Total storage position 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.780
 me in my case the one who put 6 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.600
 gigabytes then it will have 6 gb and so 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.190
 successively the 4 gigs 4 gb we see 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.660
 the available space the space of 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.449
 applications the stored data 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.750
 etcetera etcetera my sd card in this 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.400
 case and then after storage 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.070
 internal phone that we have left 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.460
 reduced in my case of 32 gigas that 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.860
 would stay in 28 I want to remember that they were 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.520
 it has remained in 23 gigabyte 25 gigas 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.990
 that we have removed for him 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.070
 storage 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:20.420
 phone intern as nothing I hope 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:23.120
 that the tutorial has served you 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.910
 a good solution that you decide 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.730
 apply it 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.100
 nothing then if you dare to comment to 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.680
 comment if you dare to ask then 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.730
 as far as it's in my hand 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.380
 I will try to answer all the doubts 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:42.450
 possible in the end thank you for visiting me and 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.450
 see you in the next regards
