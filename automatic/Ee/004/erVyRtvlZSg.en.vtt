00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
getting it down to the bare minimum and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.250 
getting it down to the bare minimum and
then<00:02:07.770> I'm<00:02:07.920> soaking<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:10.050> just

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
then I'm soaking it and it just

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
then I'm soaking it and it just
literally<00:02:10.560> comes<00:02:10.860> off<00:02:11.100> after<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.680> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
literally comes off after that so it is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.560 
literally comes off after that so it is
paint<00:02:14.130> see<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.670> actually<00:02:14.700> removes<00:02:15.300> all<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
paint see if it actually removes all the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.230 
paint see if it actually removes all the
crap<00:02:16.200> that's<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.770> paint<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.700> actually

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
crap that's on the paint so actually

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.130 
crap that's on the paint so actually
acts<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.630> cleaner<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.170> well<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.960> did

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
acts as a cleaner as well so I just did

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.730

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.949 

molding<00:02:41.640> pieces<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:46.370> off<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.700> car<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.870> it

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
molding pieces that off the car and it

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.390 
molding pieces that off the car and it
looks<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.230> they<00:02:49.470> kind<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.010> put<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
looks like they kind of just put the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.420 
looks like they kind of just put the
tape<00:02:50.580> over<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.900> existing<00:02:52.260> tape<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.160> think

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
tape over the existing tape and I think

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.150 
tape over the existing tape and I think
that's<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.820> caused<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.690> issues

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
that's what caused that all the issues

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.540 
that's what caused that all the issues
begin<00:02:56.160> with<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:57.739> I'm<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.980> remove<00:02:59.220> all<00:02:59.430> of
