to reach his level if you're doing a

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.660 
to reach his level if you're doing a
normal<00:01:32.679> kind<00:01:32.829> of<00:01:32.979> playthrough<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:33.490> can

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
normal kind of playthrough you can

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.219 
normal kind of playthrough you can
probably<00:01:34.179> beat<00:01:34.450> him<00:01:34.570> when<00:01:34.990> you're<00:01:35.109> in<00:01:35.200> your

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
probably beat him when you're in your

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.080 
probably beat him when you're in your
early<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:36.310> mid<00:01:36.460> 50s<00:01:37.499> but<00:01:38.499> the<00:01:39.189> level<00:01:39.460> curve<00:01:39.700> in

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
early to mid 50s but the level curve in

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.359 
early to mid 50s but the level curve in
canto<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.719> just<00:01:40.960> overall<00:01:41.499> so<00:01:41.829> out<00:01:42.159> of<00:01:42.189> whack

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
canto is just overall so out of whack

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.349 
canto is just overall so out of whack
it's<00:01:42.969> terrible<00:01:43.770> other<00:01:44.770> than<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.609> blew<00:01:45.939> the

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
it's terrible other than like blew the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.529 
it's terrible other than like blew the
final<00:01:46.539> final<00:01:47.259> gym<00:01:47.380> leader<00:01:47.909> none<00:01:48.909> of<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.240> of

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
final final gym leader none of the of

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.700 
final final gym leader none of the of
the<00:01:49.659> gym<00:01:49.840> leaders<00:01:50.770> have<00:01:51.759> a<00:01:51.789> significantly

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the gym leaders have a significantly

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.489 
the gym leaders have a significantly
more<00:01:53.710> powerful<00:01:54.030> team<00:01:55.030> than<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.840> only<00:01:56.259> for

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
more powerful team than the only for

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.200 
more powerful team than the only for
which<00:01:56.740> makes<00:01:56.950> sense<00:01:57.249> because<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:57.969> know<00:01:58.090> the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
which makes sense because you know the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.120 
which makes sense because you know the
lead<00:01:58.359> for<00:01:58.539> supposed<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.840> be<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.079> Primo<00:01:59.740> name

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
lead for supposed to be the Primo name

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.899 
lead for supposed to be the Primo name
of<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.280> crop<00:02:00.490> um<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.990> as<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.259> way<00:02:02.979> of<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.609> level

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
of the crop um but as a way of a level

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.569 
of the crop um but as a way of a level
curve<00:02:04.179> it<00:02:04.929> sucks<00:02:05.409> because<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:06.100> entirety<00:02:06.549> of

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
curve it sucks because the entirety of

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.570 
curve it sucks because the entirety of
canto<00:02:07.060> aside<00:02:07.689> from<00:02:07.929> red<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.470> possibly<00:02:08.860> blue

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
canto aside from red and possibly blue

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.300 
canto aside from red and possibly blue
is<00:02:10.060> just<00:02:10.390> way<00:02:10.660> too<00:02:10.720> easy<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.380> barely<00:02:11.800> get<00:02:12.130> any

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
is just way too easy you barely get any

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.420 
is just way too easy you barely get any
levels<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.960> just<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.710> not<00:02:15.160> good

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430

difficulty curve but here's the
difficulty<00:03:41.050> we've<00:03:41.650> trained<00:03:43.380> hopefully<00:03:44.380> it'll

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
difficulty we've trained hopefully it'll

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.910 
difficulty we've trained hopefully it'll
be<00:03:44.769> enough<00:03:45.120> because<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.260> strongest

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920
