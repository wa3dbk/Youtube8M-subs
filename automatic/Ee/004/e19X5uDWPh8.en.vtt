that condensation of the water started

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.400 
that condensation of the water started
and<00:00:05.730> so<00:00:06.240> most<00:00:06.660> people<00:00:06.960> haven't<00:00:07.140> thought<00:00:07.350> of

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
and so most people haven't thought of

atmosphere<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.349> long<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.400> found

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
atmosphere that long but what we found

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.849 
atmosphere that long but what we found
is<00:00:14.910> when<00:00:15.030> pollen<00:00:15.509> gets<00:00:15.809> wet<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.440> can<00:00:16.590> rupture

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
is when pollen gets wet it can rupture

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.220 
is when pollen gets wet it can rupture
very<00:00:17.220> easily<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.910> make<00:00:18.060> lots<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.449> small<00:00:18.810> tiny

particles that can act as good seeds for
clouds<00:00:22.020> when<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:22.859> about<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.160> life

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
clouds when we think about the life

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.670 
clouds when we think about the life
cycle<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.760> pollen<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> tree<00:00:24.539> emits<00:00:25.019> pollen<00:00:25.439> to

cycle of pollen the tree emits pollen to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
cycle of pollen the tree emits pollen to

try to transmit its genetic material so

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.810 
try to transmit its genetic material so
it<00:00:28.019> emits<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:28.680> huge<00:00:29.099> amounts<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.580> pollen

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it emits these huge amounts of pollen

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.669 
it emits these huge amounts of pollen
grains<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> small<00:00:30.779> chance<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.650> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
grains with the small chance that one of

grains with the small chance that one of
those<00:00:31.920> grains<00:00:32.160> might<00:00:32.430> land<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> tree

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
those grains might land on a tree

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.910 
those grains might land on a tree
somewhere<00:00:33.390> else<00:00:33.660> okay<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
somewhere else okay so it's actually a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
somewhere else okay so it's actually a
pretty<00:00:34.980> inefficient<00:00:35.820> system<00:00:36.180> from<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> trees

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
pretty inefficient system from the trees

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
pretty inefficient system from the trees
perspective<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> lot<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.489> pollen<00:00:38.910> ends

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
perspective so a lot of that pollen ends

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.270 
perspective so a lot of that pollen ends
up<00:00:39.360> around<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.290> tree<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.829> ends<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
up around the tree it ends up in the

up around the tree it ends up in the
atmosphere<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> might<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.210> transported

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
atmosphere it might be transported

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
atmosphere it might be transported
distances<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.649> maybe<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.309> several<00:00:44.700> or

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
distances for maybe one to several or

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.760 
distances for maybe one to several or
potentially<00:00:45.600> even<00:00:45.629> hundreds<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.260> kilometres

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
potentially even hundreds of kilometres

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.639 
potentially even hundreds of kilometres
our<00:00:47.640> question<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.899> focused<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.440> what

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
our question is really focused on what

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
our question is really focused on what
happens<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> rest<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.820> pollen<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
happens to the rest of that pollen that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
happens to the rest of that pollen that
ends<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> atmosphere<00:00:52.079> before<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
ends up in the atmosphere before it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
ends up in the atmosphere before it
makes<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.430> its<00:00:53.699> potential<00:00:54.030> target<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
makes it to its potential target and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.990 
makes it to its potential target and
also<00:00:55.260> before<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> ends<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.160> influencing

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
also before it ends up influencing

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.420 
also before it ends up influencing
humans<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.780> seasonal<00:00:58.170> allergies<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.160> took

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
humans with seasonal allergies we took

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.549 
humans with seasonal allergies we took
particles<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.539> them<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.469> we

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
particles and we put them in what we

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
particles and we put them in what we
call<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> cloud<00:01:02.010> condensation<00:01:02.370> nuclei<00:01:02.699> chamber

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
call a cloud condensation nuclei chamber

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.539 
call a cloud condensation nuclei chamber
which<00:01:03.989> means<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.559> test<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.339> whether

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
which means that we test to see whether

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
which means that we test to see whether
or<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> particles<00:01:06.479> could<00:01:06.780> act<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
or not the particles could act like a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.380 
or not the particles could act like a
good<00:01:07.590> CCM<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.549> were<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> atmosphere

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
good CCM if they were in the atmosphere

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
good CCM if they were in the atmosphere
so<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> cloud<00:01:10.080> condensation<00:01:10.409> nuclei<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
so a cloud condensation nuclei is a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.830 
so a cloud condensation nuclei is a
small<00:01:11.520> seed<00:01:11.850> particle<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.450> acts<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
small seed particle that acts as a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.179 
small seed particle that acts as a
collector<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.619> water<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.040> atmosphere

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
collector for water in the atmosphere

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
collector for water in the atmosphere
they<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.150> natural<00:01:15.659> from<00:01:15.930> natural<00:01:16.259> sources

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
they can be natural from natural sources

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.990 
they can be natural from natural sources
like<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.070> example<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.580> we're<00:01:17.700> talking

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
like for example what we're talking

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
like for example what we're talking
about<00:01:18.090> today<00:01:18.299> which<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.570> pollen<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.500> can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
about today which is pollen or they can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.020 
about today which is pollen or they can
also<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.950> anthropogenic<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:20.820> caused<00:01:21.000> by

humans from different types of pollution
clouds<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.310> important<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:23.729> they're

clouds are important because they're

clouds are important because they're
making<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> precipitation<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> the

see<00:01:32.790> an<00:01:32.880> increase<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.240> precipitation<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
see an increase in precipitation and the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
see an increase in precipitation and the
other<00:01:34.470> reasons<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> decrease<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
other reasons you see a decrease one of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.100 
other reasons you see a decrease one of
the<00:01:36.420> things<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.689> we're<00:01:36.810> trying<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the things that we're trying to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
the things that we're trying to
understand<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.950> how<00:01:37.979> pollen<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.909> influence

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
understand is how pollen can influence

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.020 
understand is how pollen can influence
clouds<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.350> precipitation<00:01:40.670> under<00:01:41.670> present

day and in future climate in terms of
trying<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> understand<00:01:44.579> what's<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
trying to understand what's going to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.539 
trying to understand what's going to
happen<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.659> future<00:01:46.020> climate<00:01:46.549> understanding

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
happen for future climate understanding

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
happen for future climate understanding
all<00:01:47.670> these<00:01:47.850> different<00:01:48.299> compounds<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.899> we

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
all these different compounds that we

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.420 
all these different compounds that we
put<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> atmosphere<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.009> important

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
put in the atmosphere is very important

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
put in the atmosphere is very important
so<00:01:50.670> most<00:01:50.880> people<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.420> concerned<00:01:51.869> with

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
so most people are concerned with

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.810 
so most people are concerned with
greenhouse<00:01:52.409> gases<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:52.950> carbon<00:01:53.130> dioxide<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.190 
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and
methane<00:01:53.970> they're<00:01:54.420> very<00:01:54.630> important<00:01:55.079> for

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
methane they're very important for

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319 
methane they're very important for
absorbing<00:01:55.500> infrared<00:01:56.070> radiation<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
absorbing infrared radiation but one of

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.850 
absorbing infrared radiation but one of
the<00:01:57.479> biggest<00:01:57.659> uncertainties<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.680> system

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the biggest uncertainties in this system

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.010 
the biggest uncertainties in this system
right<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.399> understanding<00:02:00.270> how<00:02:00.390> aerosols

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
right now is understanding how aerosols

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.929 
right now is understanding how aerosols
and<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> pollen<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> natural<00:02:02.520> aerosols

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and the pollen is a natural aerosols

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.639 
and the pollen is a natural aerosols
impact<00:02:03.360> clouds<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:04.049> pretty<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:04.619> known

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649

that<00:02:05.100> individual<00:02:05.729> trees<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.360> put<00:02:06.600> out

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that individual trees can put out

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.830 
that individual trees can put out
millions<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.799> pollen<00:02:08.160> grains<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.660> do

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
millions of pollen grains and when we do

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.150 
millions of pollen grains and when we do
pollen<00:02:10.200> counts<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.560> atmosphere<00:02:10.979> they're

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
pollen counts in the atmosphere they're

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.740 
pollen counts in the atmosphere they're
usually<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.700> order<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.940> thousands<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
pollen season a lot of times after

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.030 
pollen season a lot of times after
thunderstorms<00:02:15.300> there's<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.170> huge<00:02:16.500> rush<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
thunderstorms there's a huge rush in the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.980 
thunderstorms there's a huge rush in the
emergency<00:02:17.490> room<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.730> for<00:02:18.660> allergic

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
emergency room for for allergic

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.630 
emergency room for for allergic
responses<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:19.980> people<00:02:20.220> have<00:02:20.370> called<00:02:20.580> that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
responses and so people have called that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.730 
responses and so people have called that
thunderstorm<00:02:21.330> asthma<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.410> there<00:02:22.650> have

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
thunderstorm asthma and so there have

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170 
thunderstorm asthma and so there have
been<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.860> lot<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.160> theories<00:02:23.640> about<00:02:23.910> why<00:02:24.120> these

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
been a lot of theories about why these

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.480 
been a lot of theories about why these
types<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.810> events<00:02:24.960> happen<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.770> one<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.340> them

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
types of events happen and one of them

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.160 
types of events happen and one of them
has<00:02:26.730> been<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.210> in<00:02:27.360> some<00:02:27.660> way<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
has been that in some way the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.810 
has been that in some way the
thunderstorms<00:02:28.830> are<00:02:29.100> triggering<00:02:29.700> this

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
thunderstorms are triggering this

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.400 
thunderstorms are triggering this
rupture<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.209> pollen<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.930> makes<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.290> more

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
rupture of pollen and that makes it more

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.900 
rupture of pollen and that makes it more
restful<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:31.980> that's<00:02:32.130> why<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.550> more<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.820> a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
restful and that's why you see more of a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.600 
restful and that's why you see more of a
response<00:02:33.240> there's<00:02:34.050> still<00:02:34.320> no<00:02:34.709> clear<00:02:35.340> evidence

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
response there's still no clear evidence

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.030 
response there's still no clear evidence
for<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.240> but<00:02:36.570> some<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.440> those<00:02:37.530> thoughts<00:02:37.830> had

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
for that but some of those thoughts had

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.470 
for that but some of those thoughts had
us<00:02:38.190> thinking<00:02:38.520> about<00:02:38.640> what<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.270> would<00:02:39.450> mean

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
us thinking about what that would mean

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.060 
us thinking about what that would mean
for<00:02:39.690> other<00:02:40.050> atmosphere<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.830> know<00:02:40.920> for

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
for other atmosphere you know for

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.680 
for other atmosphere you know for
atmospheric<00:02:41.580> systems<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.450> from<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
atmospheric systems not just from the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.570 
atmospheric systems not just from the
human<00:02:42.930> health<00:02:43.080> perspective<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.550> of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
human health perspective and so one of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.770 
human health perspective and so one of
the<00:02:44.700> things<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.000> we're<00:02:45.090> thinking<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.600> that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the things that we're thinking is that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.110 
the things that we're thinking is that
this<00:02:45.900> could<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.320> important<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.190> specific

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
this could be important in specific

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720 
this could be important in specific
regions<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:48.780> example<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.250> northern<00:02:50.400> mid

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
regions for example in the northern mid

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.100 
regions for example in the northern mid
latitudes<00:02:51.180> where<00:02:51.300> we<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.020> these

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
latitudes where we have a lot of these

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.290 
latitudes where we have a lot of these
trees<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.500> put<00:02:53.310> out<00:02:53.430> wind<00:02:53.670> driven<00:02:53.820> pollen

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
trees that put out wind driven pollen

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.240 
trees that put out wind driven pollen
and<00:02:54.450> also<00:02:55.110> specifically<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.770> certain<00:02:56.010> times

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and also specifically at certain times

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.470 
and also specifically at certain times
of<00:02:56.370> year<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.090> important

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
of year it's not going to be important

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.270 
of year it's not going to be important
everywhere<00:02:57.870> at<00:02:58.020> every<00:02:58.260> single<00:02:58.560> time<00:02:58.770> but

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
everywhere at every single time but

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.160 
everywhere at every single time but
during<00:02:59.459> pollen<00:03:00.000> season<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.660> think<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.020> in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
during pollen season we do think that in

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.750 
during pollen season we do think that in
some<00:03:01.380> regions<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.890> could<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.130> contributing<00:03:02.730> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
some regions it could be contributing to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000 
some regions it could be contributing to
the<00:03:02.970> overall<00:03:03.450> number<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.110> small<00:03:04.440> particles<00:03:04.739> in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
the overall number of small particles in

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
the overall number of small particles in
the<00:03:05.130> atmosphere<00:03:05.220> mostly<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.300> people<00:03:06.720> have

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
the atmosphere mostly we people have

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.240 
the atmosphere mostly we people have
focused<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.410> trying<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.739> understand<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
focused on trying to understand the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.949 
focused on trying to understand the
anthropogenic<00:03:08.670> components<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.750> is

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
anthropogenic components and that is

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.540 
anthropogenic components and that is
something<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.530> extremely<00:03:10.890> important<00:03:11.459> as

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
something that is extremely important as

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.890 
something that is extremely important as
we<00:03:11.700> look<00:03:11.730> towards<00:03:12.209> understanding<00:03:12.420> what's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
we look towards understanding what's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.600 
we look towards understanding what's
happening<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.380> future<00:03:13.709> climate<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:14.459> to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
happening in future climate but to

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.860 
happening in future climate but to
really<00:03:14.820> understand<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.360> system<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> whole

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
really understand the system as a whole

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.789 
really understand the system as a whole
we<00:03:16.170> need<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.410> understand<00:03:16.830> both<00:03:16.980> pieces<00:03:18.799> the

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
we need to understand both pieces the

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.580 
we need to understand both pieces the
messenger<00:03:20.370> spacecraft<00:03:20.540> will<00:03:21.540> hit<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
messenger spacecraft will hit the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.370 
messenger spacecraft will hit the
surface<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.400> mercury<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.360> crash<00:03:24.750> at<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.200> end

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
surface of mercury and crash at the end

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.650 
surface of mercury and crash at the end
of<00:03:25.590> April<00:03:25.950> basically<00:03:26.670> we're<00:03:26.880> out<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.090> fuel<00:03:27.450> now

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
of April basically we're out of fuel now

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.720 
of April basically we're out of fuel now
we're<00:03:28.620> at<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.860> end<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.220> really<00:03:29.400> successful

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
we're at the end of a really successful

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.320 
we're at the end of a really successful
mission<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.840> what<00:03:30.959> happens
