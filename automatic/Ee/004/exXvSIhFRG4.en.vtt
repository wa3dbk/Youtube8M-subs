00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
from with our perfect rectangle like

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.570 
from with our perfect rectangle like
this<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.130> example<00:00:28.160> some<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.429> are

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
going to be sort of crude but this looks

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.270

like<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> perfect<00:00:34.350> match<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.980> we'll<00:00:35.160> go

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
like a perfect match but we'll go

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.639 
like a perfect match but we'll go
through<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.579> anyway

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
through it anyway

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.229 
through it anyway
now<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:37.829> dealing<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.280> lamb<00:00:38.610> back<00:00:38.850> strap

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
now when dealing with lamb back strap

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.700 
now when dealing with lamb back strap
you're<00:00:39.510> gonna<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.110> pieces<00:00:40.320> like

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you're gonna have little pieces like

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.430 
you're gonna have little pieces like
this<00:00:40.920> year<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.239> 5<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.050> will<00:00:43.170> cook

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
this year that's just 5 that will cook

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
this year that's just 5 that will cook
off<00:00:43.620> while<00:00:43.860> you're<00:00:44.070> cooking<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> that's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
off while you're cooking it so that's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.560 
off while you're cooking it so that's
not<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> problem<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.559> all

not a problem at all
ok<00:00:48.570> let's<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.989> started<00:00:50.149> ok<00:00:51.149> guys<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
ok let's get started ok guys so the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
ok let's get started ok guys so the
pieces<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.100> Barragan<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> skewer<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.239> want

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
pieces of Barragan the skewer you want

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
pieces of Barragan the skewer you want
to<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> perfect<00:00:55.590> size<00:00:55.850> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
to get them all in the perfect size the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.920 
to get them all in the perfect size the
easiest<00:00:57.149> way<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
easiest way to do that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770 
easiest way to do that
see<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> knife<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.559> using<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.780> basically

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
see the knife I'm using here basically

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.520 
see the knife I'm using here basically
each<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:02.399> two<00:01:02.969> slices<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.840> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
each one is about two slices of it so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.969 
each one is about two slices of it so
cut<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.720> one<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:08.360> cut<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.920> now<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
cut it like that one to cut it now you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
cut it like that one to cut it now you
have<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> leftover<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.360> fine<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
have a bit of leftover that's fine you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.090 
have a bit of leftover that's fine you
can<00:01:12.869> mince<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.770> use<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.010> for

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
can mince it you can use it for

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.330 
can mince it you can use it for
something<00:01:14.340> else<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:15.860> each<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> these

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
something else now each one of these

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.929 
something else now each one of these
pieces<00:01:17.689> just<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
pieces just get it and you want to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.560 
pieces just get it and you want to
bottle<00:01:21.119> fly<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> through<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.900> middle<00:01:23.390> not<00:01:24.390> all

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
bottle fly it through the middle not all

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
bottle fly it through the middle not all
the<00:01:24.720> way<00:01:24.810> through

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the way through

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.740 
the way through
let's<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.070> then<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.160> want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.370> open<00:01:29.610> up

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
let's like that then you want to open up

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.890 
let's like that then you want to open up
like<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> don't<00:01:32.550> equal<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.270> half<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.690> one

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
like that so don't equal to half of one

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.200 
like that so don't equal to half of one
skew<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> bone<00:01:34.830> we've<00:01:35.640> got<00:01:35.790> another<00:01:35.970> piece

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
skew of the bone we've got another piece

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.810 
skew of the bone we've got another piece
here<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.830> do<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.130> same<00:01:38.370> with<00:01:38.580> out
