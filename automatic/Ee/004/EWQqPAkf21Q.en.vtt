 people have already cut 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.050
 and let's start 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.700
 once the pig's hands are washed and 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.119

 add salt 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.219
 and we are going to cover it 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.320
 while they are going to do the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.909
 handyman in the fire we are going to 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.520
 prepare the rest of the dish 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.520
 chop vegetables make subscriptions and such 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.170

 we almost have pretty figures 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.280
 Now let's go 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.790
 meanwhile the legs are followed 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.450
 doing in the pot we will have the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.650
 legs in the pot about 25 minutes 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.650
 or approximately 30 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.450

 and we're going to incorporate the tomato for 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.480
 let Sofia be with the vegetables 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.330
 and we're going to leave him 56 minutes more than 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.330
 go suffering everything 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.829
 once we have the vegetables or fried the 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.890
 we change to a little bit more 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.890
 big 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.370
 and we are going to add the legs 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.790
 ah 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.509

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.509
 all 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.170
 ah 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.579
 once again we have all my little bottles 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.040
 let's take the throw 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.040
 water glasses 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.139
 ah 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.139
 let's take a 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.020
 mister of wine 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.400
 chardonnay 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.400
 we are going to take a little splash 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.039
 and leave it 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.039
 of the legs 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.039
 we are going to throw 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.770
 approximately another value 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.139
 ah 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.230
 we talk to each other a little 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.639
 we cast two chains 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:13.139
 full or two 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.139
 severe notebooks 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.040
 ah 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.490
 a little Provencal herbs 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.490
 well above 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.790
 and a little bit of oregano 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.970
 to the fire 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.120
 but the fire is very strong and we are going to 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.120
 Cook 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.990
 approximately 10 to 15 minutes 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.760
 all the flavors are me 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.760
 and finish doing everything with you 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:06.360
 well this is the final appearance of the dish 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:10.380
 once we've had it in the fire about 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.110
 15 to 20 minutes over low heat 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:17.630

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.630
