FEMALE SPEAKER: So have you
ever been to this class?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.129
MALE SPEAKER: No, but
like, it's supposed

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.510
to be really intense.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: It kind of
hurts your body a little.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.170
Like, I kind of can't
eat anything

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.730
afterwards for a few days.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.100
MALE SPEAKER: I'm just glad they
have free dog stroller

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.690

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.490
Yeah, but why do we have
to keep it downstairs?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.530
MALE SPEAKER: Is my dog safe?

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.264

00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:30.514
