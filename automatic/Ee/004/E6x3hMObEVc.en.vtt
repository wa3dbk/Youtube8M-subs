00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
band that like I don't know what it was

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.539 
band that like I don't know what it was
you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.110> 500<00:01:40.619> yards<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> coast

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you know 500 yards from the coast

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.940 
you know 500 yards from the coast
protecting<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.390> now<00:01:43.170> protects

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
protecting it right now protects

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.429 
protecting it right now protects
everything<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.759> five<00:01:44.970> miles<00:01:45.390> inland<00:01:46.020> right

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
everything for five miles inland right

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.800 
everything for five miles inland right
and<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.189> nobody<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.240> anything

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
