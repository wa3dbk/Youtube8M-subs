put that link into the information box

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.670 
put that link into the information box
in<00:00:37.780> case<00:00:37.930> you<00:00:38.080> want<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.290> go<00:00:38.410> watch<00:00:38.650> that

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.830 

and<00:00:43.130> on<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:44.060> you<00:00:44.180> don't<00:00:44.360> know<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.690> advantages

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
and on if you don't know the advantages

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.070 
and on if you don't know the advantages
of<00:00:45.380> protein<00:00:46.240> even<00:00:47.240> though<00:00:47.390> like<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.750> said<00:00:47.960> I'm

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
of protein even though like I said I'm

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.380 
of protein even though like I said I'm
protein<00:00:48.530> sensitive<00:00:49.220> you<00:00:49.730> still<00:00:49.970> need<00:00:50.150> protein

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
protein sensitive you still need protein

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.660 
protein sensitive you still need protein
in<00:00:50.750> your<00:00:50.840> hair<00:00:51.080> you<00:00:51.440> need<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.860> have<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.100> balance

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
in your hair you need to have a balance

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.590 
in your hair you need to have a balance
between<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.090> protein<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.130> moisture<00:00:55.130> so<00:00:55.820> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
between the protein and moisture so the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.270 
between the protein and moisture so the
protein<00:00:57.020> is<00:00:57.170> protein<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:57.770> going<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.010> give<00:00:58.160> you

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
protein is protein is going to give you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.150 
protein is protein is going to give you
a<00:00:58.310> hair<00:00:58.520> strength<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.780> need<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.200> for<00:01:00.500> hair

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
a hair strength you need that for hair

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.520 
a hair strength you need that for hair
to<00:01:01.400> free<00:01:01.580> her<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.970> be<00:01:02.090> strong<00:01:02.450> because<00:01:03.200> if<00:01:03.410> it

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
to free her to be strong because if it

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.320 
to free her to be strong because if it
just<00:01:03.680> has<00:01:03.950> all<00:01:04.220> moisture<00:01:04.640> it's<00:01:05.089> going<00:01:05.239> to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
just has all moisture it's going to

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.810 
just has all moisture it's going to
break<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:06.740> need<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.250> protein<00:01:07.670> to

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
break and so you need that protein to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.250 
break and so you need that protein to
give<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.119> structure<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:08.960> give<00:01:09.140> it

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
give it structure and to give it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.859 
give it structure and to give it
strength<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.100> it's<00:01:10.550> also<00:01:10.729> also<00:01:11.210> in<00:01:11.450> return

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
strength and it's also also in return

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.270 
strength and it's also also in return
going<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.200> make<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.440> soft<00:01:12.770> in<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.070> same

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
going to make it soft in the same

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.010 
going to make it soft in the same
process<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:13.820> know<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.000> sounds<00:01:14.180> weird<00:01:14.360> but<00:01:14.600> it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
process I know it sounds weird but it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.749 
process I know it sounds weird but it
will<00:01:15.290> give<00:01:15.500> your<00:01:15.619> hair<00:01:15.860> strength<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.580> will

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
will give your hair strength it will

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.030 
will give your hair strength it will
give<00:01:16.970> your<00:01:17.060> hair<00:01:17.300> structure<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:18.830> going

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
give your hair structure and it's going

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.219 
give your hair structure and it's going
to<00:01:19.100> make<00:01:19.250> your<00:01:19.430> hair<00:01:19.610> soft<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.630> one<00:01:21.020> thing<00:01:21.140> I

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
very protein sensitive I know if you

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.240 
very protein sensitive I know if you
follow<00:01:26.630> my<00:01:26.840> videos<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.710> know<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.009> i<00:01:28.070> talked

follow my videos you know that i talked
about<00:01:28.280> how<00:01:28.520> my<00:01:29.270> hair<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.690> protein<00:01:30.170> sensitive

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
about how my hair so protein sensitive

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
about how my hair so protein sensitive
that's<00:01:32.180> one<00:01:32.420> thing<00:01:32.600> you're<00:01:32.750> going<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:32.960> find

out once you start on your hair journey
and<00:01:35.360> once<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.869> start<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.590> know<00:01:36.710> playing<00:01:37.009> with

your hair and playing with different
kinds<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.780> conditioners<00:01:39.470> you're<00:01:39.979> eventually

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
kinds of conditioners you're eventually

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.889 
kinds of conditioners you're eventually
going<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.670> find<00:01:40.729> out<00:01:41.090> if<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.509> can<00:01:41.660> tolerate

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
going to find out if you can tolerate

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.590 
going to find out if you can tolerate
protein<00:01:42.619> or<00:01:42.860> if<00:01:43.280> your<00:01:43.460> protein<00:01:43.880> sensitive<00:01:44.420> and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
protein or if your protein sensitive and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.890 
protein or if your protein sensitive and
for<00:01:45.140> me<00:01:45.350> I'm<00:01:45.649> protein<00:01:46.369> sensitive<00:01:46.970> before<00:01:47.390> I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
for me I'm protein sensitive before I

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.050 
for me I'm protein sensitive before I
usually<00:01:48.260> use<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:48.470> protein<00:01:49.010> once<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.670> week<00:01:49.880> and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
usually use like protein once a week and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.060 
usually use like protein once a week and
I<00:01:50.510> find<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.170> was<00:01:51.290> too<00:01:51.500> hard<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:51.860> my

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
I find that that was too hard for my

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.160 
I find that that was too hard for my
hair<00:01:52.280> because<00:01:52.430> my<00:01:52.700> hair<00:01:52.909> would<00:01:53.060> always<00:01:53.360> be<00:01:53.600> so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
hair because my hair would always be so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.039 
hair because my hair would always be so
hard<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:54.979> wouldn't<00:01:55.220> be<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:55.490> soft<00:01:55.940> so<00:01:56.270> I

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
hard and it wouldn't be so soft so I

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.320 
hard and it wouldn't be so soft so I
kind<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.680> experimented<00:01:58.549> with<00:01:58.700> my<00:01:58.850> hair<00:01:59.210> and

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
kind of experimented with my hair and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.649 
kind of experimented with my hair and
notice<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.320> if<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.799> do<00:02:00.970> protein<00:02:01.970> conditioners

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
notice that if I do protein conditioners

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.620 
notice that if I do protein conditioners
either<00:02:02.930> every<00:02:03.710> two<00:02:03.950> weeks<00:02:04.280> or<00:02:04.520> every<00:02:05.119> other

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
either every two weeks or every other

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.710 
either every two weeks or every other
every<00:02:06.290> two<00:02:06.500> weeks<00:02:06.770> or<00:02:06.979> once<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.820> month<00:02:08.060> my<00:02:08.510> hair

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
every two weeks or once a month my hair

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.470 
every two weeks or once a month my hair
is<00:02:08.810> usually<00:02:09.260> fine<00:02:09.549> but<00:02:10.549> right<00:02:10.729> now<00:02:10.880> I'm<00:02:11.120> going

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
is usually fine but right now I'm going

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.300 
is usually fine but right now I'm going
with<00:02:11.630> them<00:02:11.870> every<00:02:12.200> two<00:02:12.410> weeks<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.220> been

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
with them every two weeks and it's been

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.610 
with them every two weeks and it's been
working<00:02:13.610> out<00:02:13.850> for<00:02:14.120> me<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.750> twice<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.049> month<00:02:15.410> I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
working out for me so twice a month I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.430 
working out for me so twice a month I
use<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.830> protein<00:02:16.790> conditioner<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.600> I'm<00:02:17.930> not<00:02:18.170> my

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
use a protein conditioner and I'm not my

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.289 
use a protein conditioner and I'm not my
hair<00:02:18.709> doesn't<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.340> too<00:02:19.549> well<00:02:19.580> with<00:02:19.790> heavy

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
hair doesn't do too well with heavy

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.509 
hair doesn't do too well with heavy
protein<00:02:21.290> conditioners<00:02:21.920> because<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.370> remember

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
protein conditioners because I remember

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.440

trying<00:02:23.030> out<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.540> half<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.410> day<00:02:24.590> line<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.459> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
trying out the half a day line and that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.000 
trying out the half a day line and that
was<00:02:26.660> too<00:02:26.810> much<00:02:26.989> for<00:02:27.140> my<00:02:27.260> hair<00:02:27.440> because<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.769> was

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
was too much for my hair because it was

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
was too much for my hair because it was
just<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.370> just<00:02:28.430> made<00:02:29.000> my<00:02:29.150> hair<00:02:29.360> protein

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
just I just made my hair protein

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.500 
just I just made my hair protein
overload<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.310> don't<00:02:31.820> do<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.239> heavy

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
overload so I don't do like heavy

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.289 
overload so I don't do like heavy
protein<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.410> go<00:02:34.220> with<00:02:34.430> live<00:02:34.700> proteins

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
protein I go with live proteins

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
um this i got i have two of them right

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.010 
um this i got i have two of them right
here<00:02:54.460> because<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:54.970> almost<00:02:55.330> empty<00:02:55.570> and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
here because this is almost empty and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.890 
here because this is almost empty and
this<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.010> full<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.670> i<00:02:57.970> always<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.600> backup

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
this is full so i always have a backup

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.100 
this is full so i always have a backup
so<00:02:59.680> this<00:02:59.920> is<00:02:59.950> what<00:03:00.250> i<00:03:00.280> use<00:03:00.400> as<00:03:00.910> my<00:03:01.750> light

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
protein conditioners every two weeks i

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.930 
protein conditioners every two weeks i
use<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> light<00:03:05.560> protein<00:03:05.980> conditioners<00:03:06.610> and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
use a light protein conditioners and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.850 
use a light protein conditioners and
this<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.080> what<00:03:08.230> i<00:03:08.260> use<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:10.450> here<00:03:13.830> right<00:03:14.830> here

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
this is what i use right here right here

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.010 
this is what i use right here right here
and<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.490> is<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.820> biggest<00:03:16.060> size<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.450> can<00:03:16.810> get

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
and this is the biggest size you can get

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.260 
and this is the biggest size you can get
this<00:03:17.170> from<00:03:17.350> Sally's<00:03:17.890> how<00:03:18.430> much<00:03:18.610> was<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:19.030> I

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
this from Sally's how much was this I

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.990 
this from Sally's how much was this I
think<00:03:19.840> this<00:03:20.050> was<00:03:20.410> um<00:03:21.390> i<00:03:22.390> got<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:23.680> 1199<00:03:24.160> so

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
think this was um i got it for 1199 so

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.120 
think this was um i got it for 1199 so
basically<00:03:25.390> twelve<00:03:25.720> dollars<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:26.950> can

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
basically twelve dollars and this can

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.930 
basically twelve dollars and this can
usually<00:03:27.310> last<00:03:27.820> near<00:03:28.090> for<00:03:28.330> about<00:03:28.570> mmm<00:03:29.940> maybe

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
usually last near for about mmm maybe

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.680 
usually last near for about mmm maybe
three<00:03:31.330> months<00:03:31.510> or<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.930> i'm<00:03:32.140> not<00:03:32.440> sure<00:03:32.500> but<00:03:32.890> yeah
