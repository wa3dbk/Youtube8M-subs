kind of seems like a stereotype and a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.379 
kind of seems like a stereotype and a
bit<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.859> a<00:02:41.920> play<00:02:42.129> on<00:02:42.280> words<00:02:42.459> but<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:43.060> seems<00:02:43.269> like

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
bit of a play on words but it seems like

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.660
