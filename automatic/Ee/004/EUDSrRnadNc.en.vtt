Brock<00:01:49.439> Lesnar<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:50.070> WrestleMania<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.450> far<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania so far the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania so far the
bill<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.200> match<00:01:52.439> has<00:01:52.710> been<00:01:52.860> decent<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
bill to this match has been decent I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.679 
bill to this match has been decent I
thought<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.939> would<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> hell<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.540> lot

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
thought it would be a hell of a lot

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.600 
thought it would be a hell of a lot
better<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.470> why<00:01:55.619> Brock<00:01:55.860> does<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.250> showing<00:01:56.520> up

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
better but why Brock does not showing up

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.830 
better but why Brock does not showing up
every<00:01:56.850> week<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> Undertaker<00:01:57.659> not

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
every week with the Undertaker not

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.149 
every week with the Undertaker not
showing<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.140> every<00:01:58.350> week<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.649> very<00:01:58.829> hard<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
showing up every week it's very hard to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.030 
showing up every week it's very hard to
put<00:01:59.399> together<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.180> real<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.290> compelling

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
put together a real good compelling

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
put together a real good compelling
story<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.579> has<00:02:03.000> been<00:02:03.240> decent<00:02:03.479> okay<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.290> I'm

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
