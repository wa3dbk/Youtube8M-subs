 Yevgeny Matvienko today we go where 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.120
 for strawberries 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.719
 because one very interesting feature in 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 germany 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.160
 if you do not want to buy say 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.779
 strawberries or some fruit in stores 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.369
 you can just go for more genius 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.439

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.779

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.779
 we'll see 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.440
 if you hit the road and see here 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.230
 such is the inscription that means you 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.949
 somewhere near there is a field with strawberries 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.090
 in our case, here it is, I think such fields 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.460
 there is in almost every city 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.129
 germany now we are in augsburg 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.230
 for example in munich we have near the house and 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.250
 we live very close to the center 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.670

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.900

 Amanda Yagi for one kilo of strawberries 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.580
 costs here 2 euros 40 points in the store 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.399
 if you buy strawberries from it 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.899
 cheaper than here on the field but the quality 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.820
 the products there are already completely different here 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.090
 you see yourself pick yourself choose 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.770
 berries you want to take 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.420

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.800
 This can take not just collect 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:30.670

 on the fact that if you shoot those strawberries 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.090
 while we walked here on the way met 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.490

 home there is such a field come on the field 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.540
 compile such a great airplane 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.540
 fresh strawberries fresh from the garden 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.319
 everyone collected you a lot of strawberries let's go 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.530
 now 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:31.300

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:31.300
 risen 5 take a walk 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.310
 azelaine yes and a half kilograms 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.850
 collected strawberries a little more than a kilogram 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.549
 600 and pay him for it now 3 euros 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.549
 60 cents and john 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.330
 another very interesting field which 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.240
 I want to show you this field with trees 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.640
 sweet cherries through really very much 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.350
 I myself am on this field for the first time 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.320
 and honestly never before 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.750
 saw that in one place it is possible 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.370
 so free to tear as you are here 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.459
 look at just huge breasts 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.120
 everywhere there are a lot of about 20 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.709
 rows and 100 trees on each row 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.820
 that is, can such two thousand trees 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.610
 and what's interesting here is not so much 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.000
 people at the entrance literally about 20 30 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.489
 cars 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.230
 in theory we should come here on 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.550
 collect cherries in a small tray that's 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.650
 then go and buy but no one 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.850
 prohibits eating and how much you want 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.830
 collect as much as you want 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:59.230
 I do not know how much I ate a kilogram and 2 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:59.230
 probably beats really volume sweet cherry 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.820
 very tasty on each row is two 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.370
 or three ladders specifically for people 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:14.330
 so that you can climb higher 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:17.090
 because up here are more matured 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.979
 berries were popularly harvested on 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.550
 kilograms probably 5-6 here sweet cherry 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:28.900
 let's go and pay and take home where 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.900
 we will eat 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.750
 harvest will gather up your cheat well 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.250
 how many here 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.250
 for called 3 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.040
 here we will pay for the sweet cherry then 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.080
 she 'll show you a field of raspberry 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.600
 looks like here raspberry need me here 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.540
 four fields this field and strawberry field 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.540
 sweet raspberry field and currant field 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.949
 glue 3 kilograms turned 3 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.889
 kilograms 25 grams and collected and 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.800
 paid for it 8 euros 1 kilogram in 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.840
 the store costs 5 that is, it turns out that 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.430
 sweet cherry is really cheaper to collect here 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.490
 she herself, don't let her have a delicious sweet cherry 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.520
 tastier than the store here it is in the field here I 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.050
 I would not say that this is a small field 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.870
 raspberries basically good enough 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.060
 big too you can go there absolutely 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.930
 free to pick the mole itself 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.330
 which one do you want 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.830
 and then go pay the same but raspberry 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.509
 she is not yet fully matured then 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.090
 there is a lot of green berries 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:00.690
 but what I was very surprised about is 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:04.380
 that raspberry is very large here it is straight 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.680
 That is very, very big berries are not straight 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.199
 I can say that they are so sweet 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.699
 that's pretty small but on the raspberry 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.620
 already so white ripened 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.620
