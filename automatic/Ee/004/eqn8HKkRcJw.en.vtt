00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.290
 expensive gardeners and gardeners if you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.019
 Would you like to eat peppers at the end of July 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.710
 that is, the third decade of July means 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.910
 pepper and sow too early somewhere in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.359
 end of February 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.480
 the fact is that the peppers are not dented and they 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.189
 don't grow fast they don't pull in 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.910
 seedlings are very easy to care for 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.610
 because they always don't even have enough 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 daylight sunshine all 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.730
 equal to the seedlings of peppers grows remarkably 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.550
 the only thing you have seedlings can not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.680
 grow know for what reason when you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 often without thinking 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.789
 take straight the tap water and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.120
 watering and suddenly you about poured water 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.980
 more cold poured cold water then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 peppers as if they are stubborn only worth 1 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.380
 pour cold water on them 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 as the peppers stop and will not grow 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 so peppers during seedlings 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.170
 water only with warm water and your 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.540
 water temperature must be at least 25 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.570
 30 degrees that's such water and of course 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.650
 roots if the peppers here are stunted well 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.540
 we have growth stimulants which 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.450
 nudge the pepper plants and they will 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.200
 remarkably grow so I really peppers 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.270
 here they landed a little they are with me 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.040
 undersized here chose undersized even 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.390
 pinch and make them faster in summer 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.680
 try and these are the peppers 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.829
 you know him peppers they also need them 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 care here some say here no 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.770
 I donâ€™t grow my pepper at all 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.549
 one pepper hanging one fruit and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.509
 everything and the peppers are not particularly grow in 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.680
 open ground 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.660
 but remember that peppers are such a culture 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.290
 warmth of love 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.540
 you Pepper longer necessary to heat here at 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.750
 me even the greenhouse here is even the warmth of us 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.480
 tomatoes I open the vents and that's where 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.780
 pepper no window leaves no just do not like 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.720
 the heat they need here is hot then they go 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.730
 quickly and of course 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.080
 form a bush if you release 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:37.370
 as they say, but as you want and grow 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.130
 so let it go like this 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.280
 but once I express myself and of course everything will grow 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.520
 leaves and too little fruit need 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.280
 here are the extra stepchildren 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.230
 delete and leave about you 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.600
 enough as it was here I was blown away 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.740
 here one more than once two three 4 5 six 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.240
 seven seven eight fruits are still up 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.700
 10 fruits and enough peppers can be 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.720
 plant even slightly thicker why 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.920
 because when they are planted in the thick of it 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.990
 not cucumbers, they are their leaves 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.850
 they cover these fruits and they don't burn 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.600
 from the sun because to me many 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.959
 brought 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.490
 such fruits here with burn spots 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.370
 how kind of sick are they 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.060
 it is from the sun because the glass is very 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.310
 severely burns from the sun and 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.650
 so the leaves that are directed and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.770
 under which the peppers 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.060
 don't even pick it breaks off just extra 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:50.270
 stepchildren saw here formed 10 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.520
 fruit rest here are the flowers you can 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.390
 remove it well if you are with a bush 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.200
 get 10 fruits and remove the peppers here 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.920
 loves very, very slugs 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.800
 peppers and they just fruits and eat them 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.280
 leaves eat and most importantly what else 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.090
 peppers love ginger ants so if u 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.669
 You got a lick 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.169
 Of course I'm sure like peppers 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.789
 I save them here if tomatoes are not 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.210
 spud custody pepper are not always 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.610
 I add more humus 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.700
 i don't have humus on the ground i just 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.669
 I get ready substrate for peppers and 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.350
 eggplant and a little bit of it podsypaya when 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.350
 I pour to the stalk 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.650
 here and this then watering and this 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.169
 extra food can even peppers 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.539
 do not feed but still peppers 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.400
 It was necessary to feed 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:54.229
 I feed complex fertilizer 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.229
 for peppers and eggplant tomato's tea 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.530
 I add a spoon on a bucket of everything and add 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.479
 for example a couple of tablespoons of liquid fertilizer 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.350
 there we get a 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.960
 the coffin or the effect he vegetable here you know 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.860
 this peppers are very fond of and feed 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.910
 every week and water from the barrel which 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.550
 I have a greenhouse 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.979
 I never watered with cold water and 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.530
 watered only warm and 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.100
 and I am sure that if next year you 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:30.430
 land there miracle orange cowhide 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.430
 ear something peppers you will grow
