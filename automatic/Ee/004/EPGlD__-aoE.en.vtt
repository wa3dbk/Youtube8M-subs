to<00:02:22.700> see<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.030> difference<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:24.159> speed<00:02:26.860> 3<00:02:27.860> 2<00:02:28.129> 1

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.460 

2010<00:02:35.269> 2006<00:02:37.540> not<00:02:38.540> really<00:02:38.780> much<00:02:38.930> different<00:02:39.349> when

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
2010 2006 not really much different when

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.789 
2010 2006 not really much different when
the<00:02:39.620> computer<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:41.959> like<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.260> say<00:02:42.379> this

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
the computer on but I like to say this

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.640 
the computer on but I like to say this
one<00:02:43.040> has<00:02:43.190> 4<00:02:43.640> gig<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:43.940> ram<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.239> one<00:02:44.420> has<00:02:44.690> 2<00:02:44.989> so

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
one has 4 gig of ram this one has 2 so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.380 
one has 4 gig of ram this one has 2 so
it<00:02:45.709> could<00:02:46.280> make<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.519> bit<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.819> difference

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.970 

this<00:02:50.390> one's<00:02:50.690> come<00:02:50.989> learn<00:02:51.500> newer<00:02:51.709> ones

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
this one's come learn newer ones

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.800 
this one's come learn newer ones
compatible<00:02:52.549> running<00:02:52.849> lion<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.629> older

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
compatible running lion and the older

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.199 
compatible running lion and the older
one<00:02:53.930> isn't<00:02:54.319> Sophia<00:02:54.950> come<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.430> run<00:02:55.579> lion<00:02:55.879> I

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
one isn't Sophia come to run lion I

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.020 
one isn't Sophia come to run lion I
wouldn't<00:02:56.690> go<00:02:56.840> for<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.200> 2006<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:01.280> that's<00:03:01.670> it

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
wouldn't go for the 2006 so that's it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.690 
wouldn't go for the 2006 so that's it
really

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
really

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.619 
really
so<00:03:04.700> overall<00:03:05.200> 2010<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.470> much<00:03:07.069> better<00:03:07.629> better

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
so overall 2010 is much better better

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.849 
so overall 2010 is much better better
screen<00:03:09.049> looks<00:03:09.500> good<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.819> lot<00:03:11.030> faster<00:03:11.859> thank
