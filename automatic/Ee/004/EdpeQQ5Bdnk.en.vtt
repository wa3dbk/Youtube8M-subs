00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.730
 so good afternoon today I want you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.790
 talk about growing roses from cuttings 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.530
 many as they do shove these cuttings in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 land is covered with cans 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.310
 as a result, at night either freezes or 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 dries up 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.160
 there is no sense out of it there one of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.300
 ten may will maybe not 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.220
 the rest all die 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.570
 I grow a little different roses and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.910
 cuttings on, I'll tell you how here 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.390
 On the photo you see the first so you can 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.050
 say this fall already somewhere october 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.390
 beginning of november november 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.000
 we prepare cuttings that is 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.989
 approximately 15-20 30 cm 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.440
 we cut the stalks in principle 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.079
 ends up their preparation further 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.739
 need to decide where we will be 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.149
 grow ordinary grows in 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.350
 the hospital that is already 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.840
 one from under seedlings &amp; spa 3 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 can also be used simply 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.860
 dig a trench for a half two 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.670
 spade and 1 bayonet spade 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 will be similarly the same function as 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.820
 the guy and the boy well personally I am in the fall 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.530
 when I bring in bring foliage 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:36.120
 it turns out very comfortable so here you are 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.580
 see basically with the edge of a kid like me 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.140
 I bend the foliage I have quite high 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.510
 somewhere around 25-30 centimeters 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.170
 up to its very soil from and either and foliage 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.800
 almost to the ground so that you can 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.690
 It was 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.880
 cuttings directly buried in 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.420
 soil they foliage to not let 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.740
 normal roots so then well here 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.660
 in principle, from a different angle 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.720
 estimate the height itself take as which 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.500
 it should be about but over 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 tops 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.510
 Ross is still a centimeter 1520 minimum should 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.730
 be mulch 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 exhausted can be used absolutely 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.680
 different materials 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.920
 this and straw and foliage sawdust in general 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.510
 perfect in principle all that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.480
 insulates heat and creates favorable 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.550
 microclimate for cuttings here principle 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.590
 you already see me cheering 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.500
 cuttings into the ground about 5 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.800
 centimeter buried in the ground and 15-20 on 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.390
 earth leave no more no need no 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.380
 should leave more since 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.820
 plants just can't 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.310
 create a normal root system for 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.390
 to feed such a stalk 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.000
 I stick in about 5 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.540
 centimeters pre-record yourself 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.090
 on a piece of paper where what grade is 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.330
 and save this leaflet somewhere in 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.590
 safe place here closer you can 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.080
 see what i have here 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.660
 estimate the height here about the board 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.010
 15-20 centimeters 20 probably even 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.360
 and parties buried all on top i 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 cover further foliage 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:36.310
 next you will see it on the video here in 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.390
 principle, I already sprinkled with leaves it's all 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.600
 cuttings house is created very 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.840
 favorable conditions constantly 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.790
 temperature in the region of 10 8 80 degrees 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.130
 winter never freezes 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.580
 there is a process of change 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.490
 accordingly, heat is also 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.050
 constant humidity maintained 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.390
 favorable crab clip well and at the end 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.610
 when you have already filled out a little bit 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.740
 compacted foliage on cuttings needed 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.740
 slightly condense to 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.459
 restrict cold air access to 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.500
 cutting and you can not necessarily of course 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.880
 better still be safe and 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.680
 cover with foil or some 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:31.440
 insulation materials and textiles 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.009
 can this place be this one 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.889
 greenhouse 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.169
 when you cover it with a film, here you are 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.720
 already see me in almost 10 15 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.650
 minutes before enough warm weather already 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.860
 condensation formed like there and 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.840
 initial almost already 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.370
 there was a lot of microorganism useful to them 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.350
 drugs i used 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.650
 compost also used when 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.800
 growing seedlings and she already naturally 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.290
 adopts and creates even better micro 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.780
 conditions that is constantly under where 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.479
 maintained warm good and when 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.310
 in the spring you will open it already to 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.320
 you can plant seedlings at this moment 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.420
 transplant already cuttings for 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.690
 small stones with good peace with 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.280
 the dots are clear on the news already 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.440
 can transplant in open ground 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.980
 principle without fear that they will not 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.250
 then of course for more confidence 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:32.440
 better cover them with bottles 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:36.050
 cut bottom to a little more 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.630
 secure and worries practically 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.070
 reaches 100 percent of me well from 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.660
 ten can dress no catch stalk 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.470
 principle, on this probably all the technique 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.590
 very simple and affordable nothing 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.590
 invent 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.160
 thank you for your attention see you soon
