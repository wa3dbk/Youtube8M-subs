because<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:36.060> search<00:01:36.479> target<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.079> 9

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
because they are search target for 9

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.399 
because they are search target for 9
volt<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.729> also<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.900> works<00:01:40.079> nicely

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
volt and also and it just works nicely

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.219 
volt and also and it just works nicely
because<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.509> special<00:01:42.509> summon<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.049> with

because i can special summon it with

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
because i can special summon it with
sorry<00:01:43.860> i<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.159> normal<00:01:44.490> summon<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.820> i<00:01:44.909> mean<00:01:45.060> with

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
place to go off I want to make sure that

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.780 
place to go off I want to make sure that
the<00:02:33.410> boss<00:02:33.560> monsters<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.099> do<00:02:34.250> come<00:02:34.400> out<00:02:34.519> and

the boss monsters that do come out and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.789 
the boss monsters that do come out and
meaning<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> exceeds<00:02:36.140> are<00:02:36.349> actually

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
meaning the exceeds are actually

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.890 
meaning the exceeds are actually
protected<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.760> Lance<00:02:37.970> works<00:02:38.269> nicely<00:02:38.569> and

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
protected so the Lance works nicely and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500 
protected so the Lance works nicely and
also<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.319> works<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:39.799> them<00:02:40.180> works<00:02:41.180> with<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
also it works with them works with the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.390 
also it works with them works with the
offensive<00:02:42.049> Lance<00:02:42.260> because<00:02:42.709> for<00:02:42.980> example<00:02:43.010> if

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
offensive Lance because for example if

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.220 
offensive Lance because for example if
someone<00:02:43.430> summons<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.150> example<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.599> window<00:02:45.049> and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
someone summons for example a window and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.170 
someone summons for example a window and
I<00:02:45.890> can<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.280> use<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.519> look<00:02:46.610> for<00:02:46.700> example<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.030> 9

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
I can just use the look for example a 9

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.140 
I can just use the look for example a 9
volt<00:02:47.209> punch<00:02:47.720> over<00:02:47.989> with<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:49.060> they're<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
volt punch over with this they're the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.270 
volt punch over with this they're the
two<00:02:50.360> msds<00:02:51.019> we<00:02:51.230> don't<00:02:51.410> like<00:02:51.530> back<00:02:51.739> row<00:02:51.920> as<00:02:52.040> such

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
two msds we don't like back row as such

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.729 
two msds we don't like back row as such
so<00:02:53.000> I'm<00:02:53.269> just<00:02:53.720> being<00:02:53.930> able<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.260> pick<00:02:54.709> and

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
so I'm just being able to pick and

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.949 
so I'm just being able to pick and
choose<00:02:54.920> what<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.940> destroy<00:02:56.299> is<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.599> nice

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
choose what I like to destroy is a nice

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.619 
choose what I like to destroy is a nice
option<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.610> then<00:02:58.700> finally<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> one<00:02:59.239> dark<00:02:59.450> all

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
option and then finally the one dark all

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.170 
option and then finally the one dark all
dark<00:02:59.810> are<00:03:00.049> still<00:03:00.290> really<00:03:00.500> good<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.760> still

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
dark are still really good and I still

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.569 
dark are still really good and I still
really<00:03:02.780> really<00:03:03.530> big<00:03:03.650> advocate<00:03:04.160> for<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.400> card

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
really really big advocate for the card

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.819 
really really big advocate for the card
because<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.299> just<00:03:05.930> wipes<00:03:06.200> boards<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.769> it

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
because it just wipes boards and it

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.300 
because it just wipes boards and it
helps<00:03:07.069> wins<00:03:07.610> game<00:03:08.000> basically<00:03:08.569> wins<00:03:08.959> games<00:03:09.500> so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
helps wins game basically wins games so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.839 
helps wins game basically wins games so
yeah<00:03:10.870> then<00:03:11.870> going<00:03:12.110> into<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.590> traps<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:13.190> have<00:03:13.670> to

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
yeah then going into the traps I have to

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.400 
yeah then going into the traps I have to
break<00:03:14.030> through<00:03:14.269> skill<00:03:14.510> up<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.750> nomina<00:03:15.019> mooring

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
break through skill up in nomina mooring

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.190 
break through skill up in nomina mooring
whether<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.769> put<00:03:15.890> breakthrough<00:03:16.310> skill<00:03:16.610> or<00:03:17.200> put

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
whether to put breakthrough skill or put

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.789 
whether to put breakthrough skill or put
in<00:03:18.319> fiendish<00:03:18.620> chain<00:03:18.650> because<00:03:20.620> it's<00:03:21.620> just

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
in fiendish chain because it's just

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.920 
in fiendish chain because it's just
always<00:03:22.069> a<00:03:22.220> difficult<00:03:22.459> decision<00:03:22.850> because<00:03:23.630> it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
always a difficult decision because it

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.599 
always a difficult decision because it
just<00:03:24.290> completely<00:03:24.680> depends<00:03:25.069> on<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.250> format

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
just completely depends on the format

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.690 
just completely depends on the format
for<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:26.420> at<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.739> moment<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.250> time<00:03:28.280> I've

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
for this at this moment in time I've

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.339 
for this at this moment in time I've
gone<00:03:28.880> for<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.150> breakthrough<00:03:29.450> skills<00:03:29.750> and

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
gone for the breakthrough skills and

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.319 
gone for the breakthrough skills and
