it's<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.840> interesting<00:00:46.230> working<00:00:46.739> with

it's really interesting working with

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.060 
it's really interesting working with
glass<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.870> experience<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.769> glass

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
glass because my experience with glass

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.939 
glass because my experience with glass
is<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:50.969> solid<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.649> when<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.859> was

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
is that it's solid and then when I was

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.549 
is that it's solid and then when I was
introduced<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> glassblowing<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.839> of<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
sudden it's not a solid anymore it's a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.649 
sudden it's not a solid anymore it's a
liquid<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.589> then<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.579> almost<00:01:00.030> feels<00:01:00.510> like

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
liquid and then it almost feels like

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:09.889 
liquid and then it almost feels like
honey<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.829> between<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.670> hands<00:01:08.149> for<00:01:09.149> liquids

honey in between your hands for liquids
there<00:01:10.080> isn't<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.680> structural<00:01:11.399> order<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.690> when

there isn't a structural order but when

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.560 
there isn't a structural order but when
a<00:01:13.110> liquid<00:01:13.380> freezes<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.549> does<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.149> solid

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
a liquid freezes it does get a solid

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
a liquid freezes it does get a solid
crystalline<00:01:16.380> structure<00:01:17.039> and<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:18.000> what's
