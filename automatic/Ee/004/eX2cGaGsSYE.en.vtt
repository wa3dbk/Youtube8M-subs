00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
was really disappointing was that I it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.550 
was really disappointing was that I it
was<00:01:59.880> sold<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.079> what<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.259> had<00:02:01.380> read

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
was sold to me and from what I had read

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.200 
was sold to me and from what I had read
is<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.920> well<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> theme

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
is like well this is going to theme

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
is like well this is going to theme
windows<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.840> make<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.290> touch<00:02:04.710> friendly

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950

and<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:05.880> doesn't<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.869> lets

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and it really doesn't because it lets

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.419 
and it really doesn't because it lets
you<00:02:07.320> launch<00:02:07.560> things<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.039> friendlier<00:02:08.340> way
