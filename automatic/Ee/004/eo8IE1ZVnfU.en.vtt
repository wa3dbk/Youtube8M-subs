00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
really simple design so here I'm just

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000 
really simple design so here I'm just
kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.930> drawing<00:00:51.930> some<00:00:52.199> things<00:00:52.440> don't<00:00:52.920> make

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
kind of drawing some things don't make

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
kind of drawing some things don't make
it<00:00:53.160> too<00:00:53.370> complicated<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.960> want

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it too complicated because it's we want

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
it too complicated because it's we want
to<00:00:55.320> look<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.710> fireworks<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.550> using

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
to look like fireworks and I'm using

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
to look like fireworks and I'm using
just<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> red<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> blue<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.219> course

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
just the red and blue and of course

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.610 
just the red and blue and of course
fireworks<00:00:59.699> or<00:01:00.120> every<00:01:00.780> color<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> can

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
fireworks or every color so you can

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
fireworks or every color so you can
really<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.949> whatever<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.609> wanted<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.270> then

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
really do whatever you wanted to do then

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.870 
really do whatever you wanted to do then
you're<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.290> take<00:01:04.619> an<00:01:05.159> eyedropper<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you're gonna take an eyedropper and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.660 
you're gonna take an eyedropper and
you're<00:01:06.000> gonna<00:01:06.119> drop<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:07.310> right<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you're gonna drop them right in the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.240 
you're gonna drop them right in the
middle<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.450> image<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.189> see

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
middle of your image and as you can see

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.160 
middle of your image and as you can see
it<00:01:11.430> makes<00:01:11.549> these<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:12.000> cool<00:01:12.390> patterns<00:01:12.930> as

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it makes these really cool patterns as

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
it makes these really cool patterns as
the<00:01:13.740> alcohol<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.100> pulls<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> color<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the alcohol just pulls the color out of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.830 
the alcohol just pulls the color out of
the<00:01:15.720> sharpie<00:01:16.409> marker<00:01:17.000> I'm<00:01:18.000> doing<00:01:18.180> about<00:01:18.330> 15

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the sharpie marker I'm doing about 15

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.410 
the sharpie marker I'm doing about 15
drops<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.729> just<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:20.970> many<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> like

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
drops here just do as many as you like

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.480 
drops here just do as many as you like
until<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.530> design<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.430> comes<00:01:23.610> out

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.880 

here<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.210> trying<00:01:27.329> different<00:01:27.780> designs<00:01:30.890> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
here I'm trying different designs it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:48.840 
here I'm trying different designs it
just<00:01:32.100> looks<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.729> cool

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.760 

and<00:01:49.420> make<00:01:49.600> sure<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.870> let<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.200> dry<00:01:50.470> in<00:01:50.740> between

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
and make sure you let it dry in between

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.060 
and make sure you let it dry in between
each<00:01:51.550> time<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.240> remove<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.320> from<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.650> bowl<00:01:53.860> so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
each time you remove it from the bowl so

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.860 
each time you remove it from the bowl so
this<00:01:54.610> is<00:01:54.760> what<00:01:54.880> my<00:01:55.000> overall<00:01:55.120> pattern<00:01:55.659> look

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
this is what my overall pattern look

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.510 
this is what my overall pattern look
like<00:01:56.080> so<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.470> looked<00:01:56.680> really<00:01:56.890> good

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
like so it looked really good

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.460 
like so it looked really good
and<00:01:57.729> make<00:01:58.570> sure<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.870> let<00:01:59.050> your<00:01:59.170> menu<00:01:59.440> and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
and make sure you let your menu and

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.270 
and make sure you let your menu and
