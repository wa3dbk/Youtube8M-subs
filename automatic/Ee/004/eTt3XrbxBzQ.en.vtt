find<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.199> screw<00:00:43.559> pretty<00:00:44.160> much<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> length

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
find the screw pretty much the length

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.169 
find the screw pretty much the length
from<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> edge<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.789> use<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
from the edge here to here and I use the

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.880 
from the edge here to here and I use the
head<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> screw<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.170> back<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> forth

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
head of the screw going back and forth

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
head of the screw going back and forth
as<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.250> turn<00:00:50.519> this<00:00:50.730> back<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.179> forth<00:00:51.269> the<00:00:51.600> head

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
as I turn this back and forth the head

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.619 
as I turn this back and forth the head
of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> screw<00:00:52.429> or<00:00:53.429> the<00:00:53.760> point<00:00:54.089> should<00:00:54.359> sit

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
of the screw or the point should sit

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
of the screw or the point should sit
right<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.379> lip<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> never

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
right on this little lip and it never

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
right on this little lip and it never
gets<00:00:56.489> any<00:00:56.640> longer<00:00:57.179> is<00:00:57.300> shorter<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> goes

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
gets any longer is shorter so as it goes

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.279 
gets any longer is shorter so as it goes
across<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.519> it<00:01:00.149> doesn't<00:01:00.510> cross<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.929> exact

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
across if it doesn't cross the exact

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
across if it doesn't cross the exact
Menem<00:01:01.679> it'll<00:01:02.129> make<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.370> circle<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> middle

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Menem it'll make a circle in the middle

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
Menem it'll make a circle in the middle
so<00:01:03.749> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.050> find<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.530> exact<00:01:04.890> middle<00:01:05.330> then<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so you can find the exact middle then I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.310 
so you can find the exact middle then I
take<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:08.120> standard<00:01:09.120> drywall<00:01:09.659> screw<00:01:10.080> or

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
take a standard drywall screw or

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
take a standard drywall screw or
something<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> very<00:01:11.250> sharp<00:01:11.670> point<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
something with a very sharp point and I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.260 
something with a very sharp point and I
tap<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.320> center<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.120> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
tap the very center just a little bit to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.750 
tap the very center just a little bit to
start<00:01:15.570> my<00:01:15.750> hole<00:01:16.430> then<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.820> take<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.750> sharp<00:01:19.140> end

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
start my hole then I take this sharp end

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.160 
start my hole then I take this sharp end
and<00:01:20.760> I<00:01:20.880> stick<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.300> in<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> turn<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and I stick it in here and I turn it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
and I stick it in here and I turn it
till<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.560> barely<00:01:23.040> goes<00:01:23.370> through<00:01:23.730> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
till it just barely goes through that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
till it just barely goes through that
way<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.480> to<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.080> much<00:01:25.260> glue<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
way I don't have to use as much glue to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.640 
way I don't have to use as much glue to
seal<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:27.120> is<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> bottom<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.230> a<00:01:28.320> tunafish

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

over<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.830> outside<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.580> had<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.880> press<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
over the outside and I had to press that

over the outside and I had to press that
down<00:02:48.420> very<00:02:49.080> hard<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.040> I've<00:02:50.250> run<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.610> wire

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
down very hard and I've run this wire

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.870 
down very hard and I've run this wire
all<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.150> way<00:02:51.330> through<00:02:51.660> just<00:02:52.340> before<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.609> push

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
all the way through just before I push

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.240 
all the way through just before I push
this<00:02:54.090> down<00:02:54.329> all<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> way<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> put<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> put<00:02:56.070> some

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
this down all the way I put a put some

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.120 
this down all the way I put a put some
epoxy<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.989> insides<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> ridges<00:02:59.100> and

epoxy on the insides of the ridges and
then<00:02:59.310> push<00:02:59.579> this<00:02:59.790> down<00:03:00.060> over<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.829> then<00:03:01.829> I

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
then push this down over it and then I

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.560 
then push this down over it and then I
put<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> little<00:03:02.459> bit<00:03:02.609> more<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.060> makes<00:03:03.329> this

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
put a little bit more that makes this

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.160 
put a little bit more that makes this
seal<00:03:03.900> at<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:05.070> very<00:03:05.340> bottom<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.540> bent<00:03:06.989> this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
seal at the very bottom I just bent this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.490 
seal at the very bottom I just bent this
sharply<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.820> loaded<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.380> epoxy<00:03:13.380> on

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
sharply and then I loaded the epoxy on

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.160 
sharply and then I loaded the epoxy on
the<00:03:13.680> bottom<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.310> when<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.060> set<00:03:15.359> this<00:03:15.570> down

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
the bottom of it when I set this down

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.069 
the bottom of it when I set this down
I<00:03:16.200> want<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.160> wire<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.730> touch<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.540> doesn't

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
I want that wire to touch this doesn't

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.400 
I want that wire to touch this doesn't
rocks<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.680> wires<00:03:19.950> not<00:03:20.250> touching<00:03:21.230> all<00:03:22.230> right

rocks and wires not touching all right

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.319 
rocks and wires not touching all right
then<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.829> came<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.700> I've<00:03:23.940> done<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
then it came up here and I've done the

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.620 
then it came up here and I've done the
same<00:03:24.359> thing<00:03:24.900> here<00:03:25.290> when<00:03:26.069> you're<00:03:26.250> done<00:03:26.630> you

want to fill the sink with some hot
water<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.870> then<00:03:31.319> you<00:03:31.470> want<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.739> submerge<00:03:32.459> this

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
water and then you want to submerge this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.740 
water and then you want to submerge this
long<00:03:33.900> after<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.470> glue<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.829> dried<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:36.420> want<00:03:36.630> to

submerse this and see if any bubbles

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.840 
submerse this and see if any bubbles
come<00:03:39.359> out<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.780> hair<00:03:40.049> will<00:03:40.380> expand<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.639> put

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
come out the hair will expand and put

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.210 
come out the hair will expand and put
pressure<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:43.380> there's<00:03:43.620> any<00:03:43.859> leaks

in<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.989> bubbles<00:03:46.380> will<00:03:46.530> cut<00:03:46.739> you'll<00:03:46.920> see

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
in this the bubbles will cut you'll see

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.740 
in this the bubbles will cut you'll see
bubbles<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.670> you'll<00:03:47.790> know<00:03:47.910> exactly<00:03:48.120> where<00:03:48.630> it

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
bubbles and you'll know exactly where it

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.229 
bubbles and you'll know exactly where it
is<00:03:48.900> take<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.410> out<00:03:49.590> dry<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.040> off<00:03:50.250> fast<00:03:50.639> before<00:03:51.150> it

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
is take it out dry it off fast before it

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.850 
is take it out dry it off fast before it
cools<00:03:51.450> off<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.019> sucks<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.530> water<00:03:52.799> inside<00:03:53.370> you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
cools off and sucks the water inside you

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.110 
cools off and sucks the water inside you
not<00:03:54.070> new<00:03:54.250> water<00:03:54.520> or<00:03:54.760> moisture<00:03:54.910> inside<00:03:55.510> this

not new water or moisture inside this

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.000 
not new water or moisture inside this
this<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.450> displacer<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.260> your<00:03:59.470> Stirling

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
this is the displacer to your Stirling

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.680 
this is the displacer to your Stirling
engine<00:04:00.460> now<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:02.980> bottom<00:04:03.690> you'll

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
engine now this is the bottom you'll

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.240 
engine now this is the bottom you'll
notice<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:06.130> size<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:07.230> it's<00:04:08.230> not<00:04:08.350> quite

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
notice the size of this it's not quite

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.490 
notice the size of this it's not quite
as<00:04:09.490> big<00:04:09.820> but<00:04:10.200> does<00:04:11.200> real<00:04:11.440> well<00:04:11.710> the<00:04:12.220> less<00:04:12.490> air

the air to go through this is very good
match<00:04:23.740> then<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:25.450> amount<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.080> air<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.290> have<00:04:26.470> at

and<00:04:31.060> moving<00:04:31.690> your<00:04:31.780> piston<00:04:32.290> with<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:34.240> now<00:04:37.980> set

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
and moving your piston with so now set

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.020 
and moving your piston with so now set
this<00:04:39.220> on<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:40.350> let's<00:04:41.350> see<00:04:41.620> I'll<00:04:42.010> do<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.700> pretty

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
this on it let's see I'll do this pretty

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.380 
this on it let's see I'll do this pretty
good<00:04:43.330> usually<00:04:47.190> there<00:04:48.190> we<00:04:48.430> go<00:04:48.610> usually<00:04:49.000> takes<00:04:49.240> a

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
good usually there we go usually takes a

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.130 
good usually there we go usually takes a
few<00:04:49.419> tries<00:04:50.280> now<00:04:51.280> once<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.270> get<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:52.690> set<00:04:53.020> in<00:04:55.140> I'm

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
few tries now once I get this set in I'm

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.130 
few tries now once I get this set in I'm
going<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.410> do<00:04:56.590> this<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:57.010> a<00:04:57.040> press<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:58.120> has<00:04:58.750> a

one down a straight flat board on the
step<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.850> comes<00:05:25.060> down<00:05:25.240> just<00:05:25.300> perfect<00:05:25.960> -<00:05:26.080> and

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
step it comes down just perfect - and

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.630 
step it comes down just perfect - and
hit<00:05:26.350> it<00:05:26.440> with<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.590> hammer<00:05:26.620> sometimes<00:05:27.370> you<00:05:27.490> can

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
hit it with a hammer sometimes you can

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.250 
hit it with a hammer sometimes you can
do<00:05:27.760> that<00:05:28.000> but<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.660> don't<00:05:28.840> want<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.050> damage

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
do that but you don't want to damage

show you if I grab this all the way at
the<00:05:33.460> bottom<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:36.430> lift<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:36.820> displacer<00:05:37.450> till

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
the bottom and I lift the displacer till

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.990 
the bottom and I lift the displacer till
it<00:05:37.750> comes<00:05:37.990> up<00:05:38.140> in<00:05:38.290> touch<00:05:38.470> as<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:38.800> can<00:05:39.130> that

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
it comes up in touch as I can that

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.520 
it comes up in touch as I can that
distance<00:05:40.570> right<00:05:40.630> there<00:05:41.020> is<00:05:41.140> going<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.320> have<00:05:41.410> to

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
distance right there is going to have to

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.950 
distance right there is going to have to
be<00:05:41.650> split<00:05:41.890> in<00:05:42.100> half<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:42.970> length<00:05:43.240> of<00:05:43.570> the

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
be split in half to the length of the

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.040 
be split in half to the length of the
shift<00:05:44.290> on<00:05:44.560> my<00:05:44.770> camel<00:05:45.370> later<00:05:46.000> we'll<00:05:46.660> get<00:05:46.780> into

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
shift on my camel later we'll get into

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.159 
shift on my camel later we'll get into
that<00:05:47.200> but<00:05:47.890> for<00:05:48.070> right<00:05:48.130> now<00:05:48.750> this<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:49.960> just

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
that but for right now this is just

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.840 
that but for right now this is just
showing<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.590> what's<00:05:50.770> going<00:05:50.979> to<00:05:51.070> go<00:05:51.220> I'll<00:05:51.490> show

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
showing you what's going to go I'll show

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.000 
showing you what's going to go I'll show
you<00:05:51.910> pressing<00:05:52.390> this<00:05:52.630> down<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:53.650> we'll<00:05:53.770> show<00:05:53.979> a

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
you pressing this down and we'll show a

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.500 
you pressing this down and we'll show a
couple<00:05:54.250> other<00:05:54.520> models<00:05:54.940> that<00:05:55.090> you<00:05:55.180> don't<00:05:55.360> even

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
couple other models that you don't even

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.070 
couple other models that you don't even
need<00:05:55.720> a

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
need a

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.320 
need a
for<00:05:56.490> after<00:05:57.490> that<00:05:57.610> we're<00:05:57.939> going<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.120> put<00:05:58.300> a

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
for after that we're going to put a

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.420 
for after that we're going to put a
piston<00:05:58.750> right<00:05:58.930> here<00:05:59.169> or<00:05:59.379> on<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.860> side<00:06:00.069> and

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
piston right here or on the side and

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.279 
piston right here or on the side and
then<00:06:00.520> we're<00:06:00.639> going<00:06:00.759> to<00:06:00.789> put<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.000> flywheel<00:06:01.539> this

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
then we're going to put a flywheel this

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.200 
then we're going to put a flywheel this
extra<00:06:02.800> length<00:06:03.039> up<00:06:03.280> here<00:06:03.520> this<00:06:03.789> is<00:06:03.970> going<00:06:04.120> to

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
extra length up here this is going to

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.029 
extra length up here this is going to
get<00:06:04.300> shortened<00:06:04.780> down<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.259> have<00:06:05.379> a<00:06:05.409> small<00:06:05.770> loop

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
get shortened down and have a small loop

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.279 
get shortened down and have a small loop
down<00:06:06.310> here<00:06:06.780> everything<00:06:07.780> will<00:06:07.900> come<00:06:08.110> together

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
down here everything will come together

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.240 
down here everything will come together
as<00:06:08.680> we<00:06:08.860> go

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250
