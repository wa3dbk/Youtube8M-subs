my<00:00:06.660> raw<00:00:07.049> power<00:00:07.319> centrifuge<00:00:08.099> i<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.429> from<00:00:08.670> leon

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
my raw power centrifuge i got from leon

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.419 
my raw power centrifuge i got from leon
at<00:00:09.330> wvo<00:00:09.900> designs<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> here's<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.950> centrifuge

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
at wvo designs so here's the centrifuge

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.880 
at wvo designs so here's the centrifuge
here<00:00:14.700> I've<00:00:14.910> got<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> inline<00:00:15.839> giving<00:00:16.650> shadow

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
here I've got the inline giving shadow

here I've got the inline giving shadow
by<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> way<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.880> got<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.449> line<00:00:18.690> heater

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
by the way here we got my in line heater

getting my oil totally dry at least dry
enough<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> i<00:00:36.989> felt<00:00:37.290> comfortable<00:00:37.739> running

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
enough that i felt comfortable running

enough that i felt comfortable running
it<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.370> my<00:00:38.520> truck<00:00:38.820> i'm<00:00:39.660> talking<00:00:39.870> about<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> few

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it in my truck i'm talking about a few

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
it in my truck i'm talking about a few
thousand<00:00:40.950> dollars<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> set<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.820> injectors

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
thousand dollars for a set of injectors

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.630 
thousand dollars for a set of injectors
you<00:00:43.530> want<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> cleanest<00:00:44.190> best<00:00:44.399> oil

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you want to get the cleanest best oil

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.950 
you want to get the cleanest best oil
you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.510> don't<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> have

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you can because you don't want to have

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.490 
you can because you don't want to have
to<00:00:46.079> buy<00:00:46.200> injectors<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:46.980> often<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:48.510> i<00:00:48.840> was

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to buy injectors very often so i was

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.580 
to buy injectors very often so i was
paranoid<00:00:49.649> i<00:00:50.129> ran<00:00:50.489> my<00:00:50.520> oil<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:51.300> tried<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.440> his

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
paranoid i ran my oil i tried to get his

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.100 
paranoid i ran my oil i tried to get his
clean<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:52.980> i<00:00:53.070> could<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.840> after<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> while<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
clean as i could and after a while I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
clean as i could and after a while I
decided<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.309> know<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.910> ain't<00:00:57.090> cutting

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
decided you know this just ain't cutting

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.549 
decided you know this just ain't cutting
it<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.559> gave<00:00:58.800> Lee<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> call<00:01:00.149> over<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.750> wvo

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it so I gave Lee on a call over at wvo

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.680 
it so I gave Lee on a call over at wvo
designs<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.850> he<00:01:03.059> talked<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:03.420> into<00:01:03.449> getting

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
designs and he talked me into getting

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.000 
designs and he talked me into getting
one<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.110> his<00:01:04.439> centrifuges<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.869> yeah<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.770> was

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
one of his centrifuges and yeah I was

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.399 
one of his centrifuges and yeah I was
pretty<00:01:08.159> skeptical<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
pretty skeptical at first I kind of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.410 
pretty skeptical at first I kind of
thought<00:01:10.740> there's<00:01:11.220> no<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.939> feed<00:01:12.210> some

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
thought there's no way you can feed some

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.990 
thought there's no way you can feed some
oil<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.680> Bowl<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.340> magically<00:01:14.880> all

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
oil into a little Bowl and magically all

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.310 
oil into a little Bowl and magically all
the<00:01:15.119> crap<00:01:15.330> flies<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.170> good

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the crap flies out and you get good

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.620 
the crap flies out and you get good
clean<00:01:16.560> oil<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.909> gave<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.659> try<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:20.600> ran<00:01:21.600> some

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
clean oil so I gave it a try I ran some

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.080 
clean oil so I gave it a try I ran some
oil<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:22.890> ran<00:01:23.070> through<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.490> still

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
oil in that I had ran through my still

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.380 
oil in that I had ran through my still
set<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.080> 5<00:01:25.320> micron<00:01:25.830> filter<00:01:26.250> bag<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.759> ran

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
set up with my 5 micron filter bag I ran

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.760 
set up with my 5 micron filter bag I ran
it<00:01:27.540> through<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> centrifuge<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> was

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it through the centrifuge and I was

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.830 
it through the centrifuge and I was
surprised<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.970> crap<00:01:30.360> flung

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
surprised that what kind of crap flung

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.800 
surprised that what kind of crap flung
out<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.950> oil<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:33.299> stuck<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
out of the oil and got stuck to the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.350 
out of the oil and got stuck to the
walls<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> bowl<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> centrifuge

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
walls on the bowl of the centrifuge

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.469 
walls on the bowl of the centrifuge
amazing<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:37.640> just<00:01:38.640> couldn't<00:01:38.820> believe<00:01:39.000> what

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
amazing I just couldn't believe what

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
amazing I just couldn't believe what
kind<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.840> crap<00:01:40.110> came<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.710> oil<00:01:40.979> stuff

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
kind of crap came out of that oil stuff

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
kind of crap came out of that oil stuff
that<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.119> passing<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> running<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.110> my

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that I was passing and running in my

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
that I was passing and running in my
truck<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> decided<00:01:45.270> never<00:01:45.600> again<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:46.200> not

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
truck so I decided never again I'm not

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.249 
truck so I decided never again I'm not
going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.619> run<00:01:46.880> less<00:01:47.880> than<00:01:48.149> good<00:01:48.479> oil<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.110> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
going to run less than good oil in my

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.510 
going to run less than good oil in my
truck<00:01:49.290> I'm<00:01:49.770> gonna<00:01:49.979> run<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> through<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
truck I'm gonna run it through a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.889 
truck I'm gonna run it through a
centrifuge<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.270> impressed<00:01:54.570> with

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
centrifuge so I was very impressed with

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
centrifuge so I was very impressed with
the<00:01:55.049> results<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.390> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the results that I got from the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
the results that I got from the
centrifuge<00:01:57.899> amazing<00:01:58.649> yeah<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.460> cost<00:01:59.790> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
centrifuge amazing yeah they cost a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.819 
centrifuge amazing yeah they cost a
little<00:02:00.060> bit<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.329> money<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.719> at<00:02:01.079> first<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.680> if

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
little bit of money up at first but if

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.050 
little bit of money up at first but if
you're<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> stick<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.310> oil<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.909> any

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you're going to stick with oil for any

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.780 
you're going to stick with oil for any
length<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.479> time<00:02:03.740> definitely<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:05.310> yourself<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
length of time definitely get yourself a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.839 
length of time definitely get yourself a
centrifuge<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.899> will<00:02:07.020> quickly<00:02:07.320> work<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
centrifuge it will quickly work for it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.390 
centrifuge it will quickly work for it
will<00:02:08.940> quickly<00:02:09.090> pay<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.750> itself<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.400> quality

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
will quickly pay for itself in quality

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.960 
will quickly pay for itself in quality
oil<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:12.000> you'll<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.330> running<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.750> your

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
oil that you'll be running in your

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.590 
oil that you'll be running in your
truck<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.560> also<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.730> kind<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.120> hands

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
truck and also it's just kind of hands

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.570 
truck and also it's just kind of hands
off<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:17.080> mean<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.500> fill<00:02:17.830> up<00:02:17.950> my<00:02:17.980> water<00:02:18.100> heater

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
off I mean I fill up my water heater

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.850 
off I mean I fill up my water heater
here<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.930> gravity<00:02:20.320> feed<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.650> down

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
here and then I gravity feed it down

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.800 
here and then I gravity feed it down
into<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.520> centrifuge<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.270> about<00:02:22.510> eight

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
into the centrifuge at about eight

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.530 
into the centrifuge at about eight
gallons<00:02:23.140> an<00:02:23.470> hour<00:02:23.560> or<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.310> then<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:25.300> tote

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
gallons an hour or so and then this tote

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.930 
gallons an hour or so and then this tote
down<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:25.990> catches<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.040> then<00:02:27.700> from<00:02:27.910> here

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
down here catches it and then from here

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.090 
down here catches it and then from here
I<00:02:28.120> use<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.540> pump<00:02:28.750> down<00:02:28.870> there<00:02:29.350> if<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:29.980> see

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
I use the pump down there if you can see

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.240 
I use the pump down there if you can see
it<00:02:30.960> it's<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:31.990> little<00:02:32.200> pump<00:02:32.440> down<00:02:32.590> there<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> pull

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
it it's a little pump down there I pull

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.880 
it it's a little pump down there I pull
it<00:02:33.400> out<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.760> tote<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.720> pump<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.110> into<00:02:35.380> my

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
it out of the tote and I pump it into my

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.980 
it out of the tote and I pump it into my
truck<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.370> didn't<00:02:37.030> bother<00:02:37.150> testing<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.810> oil

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
truck I didn't bother testing the oil

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.050 
truck I didn't bother testing the oil
anymore<00:02:38.320> for<00:02:38.650> water<00:02:38.860> because<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.850> going<00:02:40.000> to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
anymore for water because it's going to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.390 
anymore for water because it's going to
pull<00:02:40.270> out<00:02:40.480> any<00:02:40.630> water<00:02:40.960> that's<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.530> oil<00:02:41.740> any

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
pull out any water that's in the oil any

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.220 
pull out any water that's in the oil any
kind<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.730> chunks<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.240> crap<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.810> would<00:02:44.110> have

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
kind of chunks and crap that would have

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.620 
kind of chunks and crap that would have
passed<00:02:44.530> through<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.950> filter<00:02:45.430> or<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.000> filter<00:02:46.390> bag

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
passed through a filter or a filter bag

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.630 
passed through a filter or a filter bag
all<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.800> stuff's<00:02:48.040> going<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.250> come<00:02:48.400> out<00:02:48.550> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
all that stuff's going to come out and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.190 
all that stuff's going to come out and
get<00:02:48.730> stuck<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.209> walls<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.690> centrifuge

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
get stuck to the walls of the centrifuge

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
centrifuge and they'll get a little

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.110 
centrifuge and they'll get a little
crazy<00:03:01.540> about<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.140> upfront<00:03:02.470> cost<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.550> but

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120
