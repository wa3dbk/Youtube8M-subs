the picture and see exactly where these

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.039 
the picture and see exactly where these
divisions<00:02:18.189> goes<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.209> then<00:02:19.659> I'm<00:02:19.780> gonna<00:02:19.870> be

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
divisions goes and then I'm gonna be

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.530 
divisions goes and then I'm gonna be
starting<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.530> plug<00:02:20.999> applying<00:02:21.999> the<00:02:22.120> black<00:02:22.299> all

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
starting the plug applying the black all

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.839 
starting the plug applying the black all
over<00:02:22.749> this<00:02:23.049> Napa<00:02:23.349> color<00:02:23.650> all<00:02:24.159> over<00:02:24.219> the<00:02:24.579> area

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
over this Napa color all over the area

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.239 
over this Napa color all over the area
isn't<00:02:25.090> gonna<00:02:25.269> be<00:02:25.420> showing<00:02:25.780> also<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.980> ears

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
and on the bald cap on the NAG

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:51.629 
and on the bald cap on the NAG
everywhere<00:02:49.799> well<00:02:50.799> I'm<00:02:50.889> gonna<00:02:50.980> be<00:02:51.159> using<00:02:51.489> a

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
everywhere well I'm gonna be using a

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.490 
everywhere well I'm gonna be using a
bigger<00:02:51.849> brush<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.419> cover<00:02:52.569> more<00:02:52.900> area<00:02:53.199> and<00:02:53.230> then

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
bigger brush to cover more area and then

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.199 
bigger brush to cover more area and then
I'm<00:02:53.590> gonna<00:02:53.709> move<00:02:53.949> to<00:02:54.010> smaller<00:02:54.459> brush<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.000> go<00:02:55.180> a

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
I'm gonna move to smaller brush to go a

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.509 
I'm gonna move to smaller brush to go a
little<00:02:55.510> deeper<00:02:55.659> into<00:02:55.930> detail<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.889> then<00:02:57.069> why<00:02:57.219> a

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
little deeper into detail but then why a

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.399 
little deeper into detail but then why a
tan<00:02:57.790> after<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.329> play<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.719> red<00:02:58.900> I'm<00:02:59.079> gonna<00:02:59.230> go

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
tan after I play the red I'm gonna go

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.349 
tan after I play the red I'm gonna go
back<00:02:59.590> once<00:02:59.829> again<00:03:00.069> with<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.790> fine<00:03:01.030> brush<00:03:01.329> and

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
back once again with the fine brush and

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.809 
back once again with the fine brush and
really<00:03:02.260> define<00:03:02.739> all<00:03:03.189> the<00:03:03.370> lines

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
really define all the lines
