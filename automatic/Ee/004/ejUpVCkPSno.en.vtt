absolutely<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.139> think<00:05:31.229> it's<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:32.550> is<00:05:32.669> it's<00:05:33.300> good

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
absolutely I think it's it is it's good

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.300 
absolutely I think it's it is it's good
because<00:05:33.690> it<00:05:33.960> allows<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.949> take<00:05:35.159> your

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
because it allows you to take your

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.159 
because it allows you to take your
aggression<00:05:35.940> out<00:05:36.060> or<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.720> know<00:05:36.780> you've<00:05:36.990> had<00:05:37.110> a

all<00:05:41.190> in<00:05:41.340> good<00:05:41.460> measure<00:05:41.639> when<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.300> first<00:05:42.509> game
