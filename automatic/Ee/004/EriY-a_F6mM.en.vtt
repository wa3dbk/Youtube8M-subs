00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
strong enough you get a lot of bounce

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.070 
strong enough you get a lot of bounce
when<00:02:10.340> you're<00:02:10.460> running<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.150> really<00:02:11.360> is

when you're running so it really is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.830 
when you're running so it really is

you're not going to get thrown out or
throwing<00:03:38.989> down<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.910> guess<00:03:41.630> last<00:03:41.810> bit<00:03:41.959> ly<00:03:42.050> we

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
throwing down I guess last bit ly we

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.090 
throwing down I guess last bit ly we
should<00:03:42.260> probably<00:03:42.440> show<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.680> our<00:03:42.800> pistol

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
laners because that's kind of where we

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.030 
laners because that's kind of where we
came<00:03:44.330> from

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.039
