00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.230
 main livelihood 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.910
 or percent 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.970
 we can 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 three quotes scientifically 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.039
 quite certainly is planned that is happening in every organism have 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.039
 tissue type of stimuli 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.589
 because the science of garbage eats to predict what is happening 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.999
 but actually 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.500
 the prince leading individualities does not say what good 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.690
 the one that actually see individual part and can change one subject to another 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 by simple sight for example we will see 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 we can say that certain people can have 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.700
 ease to comment muscle mass 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.839
 I can also tell you at a glance 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.090
 that this other person for example 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.560
 certain teenagers it would cost me a lot to mind 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.420
 percent in muscle mass 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
 by more than 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.250
 ee well answers that are individual 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670
 and that it depends on me a little bit 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.600
 of the t of the genetic status 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.050
 p of each person and people 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.700
 quilmes costs a lot 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.810
 percent 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.999
 descend weight there are other people who maintain the pulse very easily 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.270
 there are people who have a lot of mental muscle mass, there are people who lose 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.830
 muscle mass very quickly 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.020
 people who maintain muscle mass is very good and surprising 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.360
 a little bit of one of the things that are commented on previously of the statut 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.960
 Physiological of the individual 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.350
 their sociological status of what one can 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 in little it would depend on the sports history 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.399
 what this person did previously 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.540
 and also 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.250
 ingram she also of the genetic part 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.990
 that is an Olympic champion surely that input for no will not be champion 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.399
 Olympic nothing more 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.399
 training well for many years there has to be a component 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.439
 unquestionable genetic 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.590
 that does not come up to that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.360
 percent but inside everything we can predict and know 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.730
 thanks to the denunciations of the sports 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.730
 Per hundred we have to take into account that each individual 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.299
 he is a particular being 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 we have to keep in mind 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.839
 principle of res rÃ©ver civilidad 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.439
 while physical activity is a very good thing 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.369
 because certain changes we will do quickly in a few weeks with few 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.280
 months we can see competitions 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.669
 and feel changes really deep inside a person 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:39.060
 but just as those changes can be achieved 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.529
 in relatively short time weeks months in a few years this serious error 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.620
 what has been achieved with physical activity 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.299
 this relatively 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.060
 percent much easier 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.189
 d 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.870
 of what it costs to earn as 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.829
 the times 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.429
 of adaptation in general are 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.899
 longer than the times of mismatch 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.870
 percent is very 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.910
 common to see how it costs a person to earn 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.400
 kilos of muscle weight 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.340
 for then it is with a simple cold with a simple 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.519
 percent 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.409
 we neglected a week 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.999
 today they start a trip of 15 days 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.240
 it cost him to climb 4 5 kilos of weight 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.720
 for a year 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.709
 and in two weeks in three weeks he lost 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.309
 those kilos of weight very quickly like people who for months 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:34.729
 percent 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:39.329
 they lose a percent a couple of percent weight percent of weight and I put 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.140
 and in relation to mind 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.290
 by 100 very good very easily they recover it again 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.209
 ok people that understand athletes that 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.829
 work the technique 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.009
 during 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.409
 during color certain technical aspect 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.399
 and later 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:59.679
 with a small change 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:04.449
 in little oversight the stoke city managed to recover with so much was achieved 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:05.280
 move along 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.279
 with so much fossil 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.409
 sacrifice is quickly lost towards 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.349
 physical activity luckily improve vii 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.760
 do not see changes 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.590
 by the way relatively fast shakes 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.639
 does not feel also relatively fast 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.340
 that adaptation finally longer and more expensive 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.219
 that maladaptation is much easier to lose 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.120
 it's much harder 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.030
 certainly praying i what is progressed can be 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.590
 quickly 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.550
 by this principle networks of reversibility 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.770
 porsche that take it into account 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.900
 and that to speak with sportsmen but of opportunists 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.000
 percent for how do you think sometimes for a certain weeks of vacation 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.879
 why a week a trip 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.710
 hong kong and simple cold a simple triquis a simple 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.750
 33 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.650
 can for sara lose the effort and sacrifice of several years with several 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.770
 months at least does 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.770
 the intense work liquidated 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.379
 overload prince 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.379
 this is another basic principle of milk what the exercise where they have to 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:20.469
 see the physical stimulus have to fear repetitive habitual sequence with 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.959
 high degree of other progressivity and Augustine harmonic development 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.180
 percent in the variables that we discussed earlier in relation to the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.250
 intensive training volume training 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.370
 that the stimuli frequency, that is, there must be a blunt or in the 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.409
 training planning 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.150
 there must be pneumonia 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.360
 Indians in the training cycles 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.059
 in train career 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:49.530
 carved by the volume amount also intends to also sto 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.110
 after stimuli 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.469
 on the day of the week in 8 months 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:00.270
 for what percent this principle of overload is this is favorable 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.760
 to the athlete because 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.130
 a bad planning nothing 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.210
 of training load can lead to a single workout 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.470
 instead of having an improvement in physical aptitudes having a crash 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.580
 Have a loss for poor planning 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.539
 Sports training
