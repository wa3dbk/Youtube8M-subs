00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.379
 hello to youtube without tricks 1000 and good 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.360
 Today I'm still very interesting 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.160
 completely new on the mule truck 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.600
 and is that a friend of ours as you can 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.300
 see can be put in the back 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.859
 and can shoot the best of all this 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.019
 is that you can open the door with a 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.570
 button by pressing a button will take the 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.099
 door and you can aim with the gun a 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.650
 which I really liked 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.420
 and this function is completely new 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.250
 one thing also very interesting is that 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.390
 while I'm inside the truck like 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.940
 you can see it's going to be completely 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.800
 immortal, unless you do justly 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.600
 like me that I take a change of weapon I put on 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.520
 to the mini with and just start to 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.960
 shoot at the moment my friend opens 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.940
 the door fixed that is closed 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.230
 start here to shoot and my friend then 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.270
 the idea of ​​opening the door and 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.710
 Automatically I kill him but also 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.109
 If the door is closed we will be 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.670
 completely immortal then we go 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.000
 to see if we are going to reach 1000 likes by 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.100
 this other saucepan and let's go to it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 to start simply a friends or 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 climb up as a mule truck driver and go to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.930
 hit the passenger door against a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.490
 wall fix very well that is attached to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 the passenger door against a wall 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.910
 and we will simply go to the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 back we'll see the button 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.450
 get on the truck and you can see that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.400
 it seems that we are in the place of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.470
 copilot but if we put for example the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 first person we will realize that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 we're going to be right in the part of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.900
 back that this by the way the old 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.400
 generation is a little bit uncomfortable but 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.260
 As you can see I'm right here 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.380
 it's okay that I can be seen and if I get 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.759
 here the first person I know perfectly 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.350
 and as you can see if we turn what is 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.450
 the camera we can see the whole interior 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.410
 of the truck and it was a lot of people to ask 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.300
 how can the door be opened 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.100
 we are simply going to press the button 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.140
 point out that you can see that my friend 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.240
 was blocking the door and just 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.740
 as soon as we pointed the door opened and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.020
 as soon as we stop pointing the door 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.360
 is going to close and this is one thing that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.369
 nobody knows me at least has not seen 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 never and the truth is very cool 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.600
 so let's see if we're going to get to 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.039
 thousand likes for this piece of true dipper and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.200
 I recommend with stockings just my 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.539
 previous video because we can get 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.130
 the bag of bank robberies 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.190
 completely without help and in addition to a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.770
 way very but what 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.970
