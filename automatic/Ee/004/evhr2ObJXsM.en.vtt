00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
about connecting people I think of my

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.580 
about connecting people I think of my

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
would be off to college and I can

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.170 
would be off to college and I can
imagine<00:01:16.660> being<00:01:16.870> able<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.140> call<00:01:17.650> them<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.220> see

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
imagine being able to call them and see

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.170 
imagine being able to call them and see
them<00:01:19.510> but<00:01:20.170> also<00:01:20.320> look<00:01:21.160> into<00:01:21.400> their<00:01:21.520> eyes<00:01:21.640> and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
them but also look into their eyes and

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.070 
them but also look into their eyes and
see<00:01:22.690> how<00:01:22.870> are<00:01:22.990> they<00:01:23.110> really<00:01:23.350> doing<00:01:24.870> what<00:01:25.870> makes

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
see how are they really doing what makes

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.740 
see how are they really doing what makes
it<00:01:26.229> even<00:01:26.410> better<00:01:26.620> is<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:28.240> switches<00:01:28.600> from

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
it even better is that it switches from

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.380 
it even better is that it switches from
the<00:01:28.960> front<00:01:29.290> camera<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.160> back<00:01:30.340> camera<00:01:30.640> so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
the front camera to the back camera so

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.990 
the front camera to the back camera so
you<00:01:31.420> can<00:01:31.540> show<00:01:32.320> someone<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:33.520> you're<00:01:33.729> seeing

and<00:04:43.090> we<00:04:43.270> started<00:04:43.840> with<00:04:44.490> completely<00:04:45.490> opposing

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
and we started with completely opposing

and we started with completely opposing
goals<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:47.169> wanted<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.500> make<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:47.860> iPhone

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340

more<00:04:48.970> capable<00:04:49.509> we<00:04:49.780> wanted<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.169> add<00:04:50.319> more

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
more capable we wanted to add more

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.400

feature<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.849> yet<00:04:52.270> at<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.479> same<00:04:52.509> time<00:04:52.720> we

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
feature and yet at the same time we

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.900 
feature and yet at the same time we
wanted<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.740> make<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:53.979> smaller<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.550> even

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
wanted to make it smaller and even

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.300 
wanted to make it smaller and even
thinner<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:56.349> lets<00:04:56.560> us<00:04:56.680> some<00:04:56.889> really

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
thinner and that lets us some really

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.809 
thinner and that lets us some really
surprising<00:04:57.490> innovation<00:04:59.250> and<00:05:00.250> we<00:05:00.370> developed

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
surprising innovation and we developed

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.029 
surprising innovation and we developed
an<00:05:00.910> entirely<00:05:01.479> new<00:05:01.810> grade<00:05:02.139> of<00:05:02.440> stainless<00:05:02.860> steel

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
an entirely new grade of stainless steel

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.210 
an entirely new grade of stainless steel

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
steel frame functions as the antenna but

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.180 
steel frame functions as the antenna but
also<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.419> primary<00:05:13.720> structure<00:05:14.440> giving<00:05:15.069> us

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
also the primary structure giving us

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.469 
also the primary structure giving us
more<00:05:15.400> internal<00:05:15.940> volume<00:05:17.639> we<00:05:18.639> also<00:05:18.789> developed<00:05:19.389> a

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
more internal volume we also developed a

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.390
