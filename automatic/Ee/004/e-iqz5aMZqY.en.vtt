wrestling at at the time like for

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.340 
wrestling at at the time like for
instance<00:03:06.090> Florida<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.270> doesn't<00:03:08.020> have<00:03:08.170> any

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
instance Florida it doesn't have any

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.250 
instance Florida it doesn't have any
mountains<00:03:08.770> but<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.070> has<00:03:09.250> Space<00:03:09.760> Mountain<00:03:10.360> so

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
mountains but it has Space Mountain so

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.790 
mountains but it has Space Mountain so
were<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.770> king<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.490> Space<00:03:13.000> Mountain<00:03:13.770> yeah<00:03:14.770> I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
were you king of Space Mountain yeah I

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.290 
were you king of Space Mountain yeah I
know<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.340> would<00:03:15.490> be<00:03:15.520> gimmick<00:03:16.120> infringement

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
know that would be gimmick infringement

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.600 
know that would be gimmick infringement
with<00:03:16.990> Flair<00:03:17.380> but<00:03:17.680> that's<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.160> only<00:03:18.400> thing

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
with Flair but that's the only thing

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.070 
with Flair but that's the only thing
that<00:03:18.760> makes<00:03:18.970> sense<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.450> me<00:03:19.570> because<00:03:19.900> there's

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
that makes sense to me because there's

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.620 
that makes sense to me because there's
no<00:03:20.230> other<00:03:20.380> Mountains<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.310> Florida<00:03:22.209> where<00:03:22.420> you

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
no other Mountains in Florida where you

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.660 
no other Mountains in Florida where you
won<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.110> king<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.530> mountain<00:03:23.950> title<00:03:24.340> now

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
won that king of the mountain title now

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.910 
won that king of the mountain title now
that<00:03:24.989> immediately<00:03:25.989> then<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.739> what<00:03:26.890> I

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that immediately then you know what I

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.190 
that immediately then you know what I
thought<00:03:27.220> about<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.520> wrote<00:03:27.820> about<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.330> too<00:03:28.630> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
thought about I wrote about this too the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.870 
thought about I wrote about this too the
fact<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.890> know<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.070> live<00:03:30.489> in<00:03:30.640> Nashville

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
fact that you know you live in Nashville

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.720
