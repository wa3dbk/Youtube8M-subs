scale them down more effectively and it
will<00:03:08.010> keep<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.909> quality<00:03:09.450> better<00:03:09.599> instead<00:03:10.349> of

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
will keep the quality better instead of

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.259 
will keep the quality better instead of
scaling<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.829> up<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.489> hope<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:12.060> tutorial
