00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.490
 brain and spinal disease 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.219
 she with the immune system attacks the myelin 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.219
 a layer around the nerves and the same 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.829
 when milene attacked 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.779
 transmit PT's information 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.220
 this may occur when the immune system 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 It's even a table. 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.020
 sends white blood cells called a symposium that macrophages to 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.870
 to combat the tax 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.250
 and repair damage 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.440
 these cells are programmed to attack the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.570
 some others 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.440
 fight the specifics 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.060
 it is not known what causes the disease 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.690
 researchers suspect that a vehicle protein an organism 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 similar 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.790
 the root of the disease 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.140
 This causes the immune system to attack the tissues of the body in the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 multiple sclerosis the target can 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.510
 in promotion allows 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.650
 that these cells with 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.060
 light blood-brain barrier 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.050
 are of the central nervous system 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.310
 by first binding to the blood cell such as Velcro 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 and then passing the brain tissue 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.960
 destroys myelin protein with the release of toxins and by attack 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.330
 direct 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.310
 The attack is melina damaging the protection of nerves and may even carry 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.510
 the nerves themselves 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.910
 these damages can be seen in a 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.540
 magnetic resonance 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.680
 the result is a series of symptoms 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.260
 of cementum of the hands and feet to vision and speech problems
