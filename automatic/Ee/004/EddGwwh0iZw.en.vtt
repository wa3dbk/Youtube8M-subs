for the sake of our recipe I'm going to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.460 
for the sake of our recipe I'm going to
use<00:02:36.580> two<00:02:36.850> smaller<00:02:37.270> leaves<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.900> place<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.320> this

notice<00:03:07.360> here<00:03:07.510> with<00:03:07.989> Austin<00:03:08.380> with<00:03:08.500> these

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
notice here with Austin with these

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.860 
notice here with Austin with these
degrees<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.190> advanced<00:03:09.580> movie<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.239> we're

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
degrees and this advanced movie is we're

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.449 
degrees and this advanced movie is we're
gonna<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.110> using<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> entire<00:03:11.739> leaf<00:03:11.950> no<00:03:12.280> need

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
gonna be using the entire leaf no need

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.940 
gonna be using the entire leaf no need
to<00:03:12.700> measure<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.660> leaves<00:03:13.870> out<00:03:14.080> anymore<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.830> so

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
to measure the leaves out anymore and so

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.800 
to measure the leaves out anymore and so
we're<00:03:15.100> measuring<00:03:15.310> cup<00:03:15.640> not<00:03:16.239> necessary

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
we're measuring cup not necessary

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.370 
we're measuring cup not necessary
because<00:03:17.350> we<00:03:17.739> are<00:03:17.980> advanced<00:03:18.580> now<00:03:18.850> and

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
because we are advanced now and

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
because we are advanced now and
depending<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.470> what<00:03:20.650> type<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:20.890> blender<00:03:21.310> you

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
depending on what type of blender you

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.490 
depending on what type of blender you
have<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:22.270> may<00:03:22.390> want<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.720> go<00:03:22.870> ahead<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.140> take

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
have you may want to go ahead and take

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.290 
have you may want to go ahead and take
off<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> stalk<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.820> blend<00:03:25.120> up<00:03:25.270> the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
off the stalk and just blend up the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.210 
off the stalk and just blend up the
leaves<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> we<00:03:27.760> will<00:03:28.060> start<00:03:28.330> with<00:03:28.450> one

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
leaves so we will start with one

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.070 
leaves so we will start with one
charlief<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:31.330> char<00:03:31.600> these<00:03:32.519> three

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
charlief to char these three

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.990 
charlief to char these three
and<00:03:35.560> why<00:03:35.800> not<00:03:36.010> afford<00:03:38.430> now<00:03:39.430> I'm<00:03:39.610> gonna<00:03:39.790> blend

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
and why not afford now I'm gonna blend

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.030 
and why not afford now I'm gonna blend
this<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.390> for<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:41.260> gonna<00:03:41.410> be<00:03:41.590> over<00:03:41.710> 30

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
this up for it's gonna be over 30

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.430 
this up for it's gonna be over 30
seconds<00:03:42.460> because<00:03:42.940> we're<00:03:43.690> using<00:03:43.900> work<00:03:44.170> grains

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
seconds because we're using work grains

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.320 
seconds because we're using work grains
so<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.160> would<00:03:45.490> say<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.700> might<00:03:45.910> want<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.180> blend

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
so I would say you might want to blend

00:03:46.330 --> 00:04:01.410 
so I would say you might want to blend
this<00:03:46.420> for<00:03:46.480> about<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.900> minute<00:03:47.140> or<00:03:47.290> so<00:04:00.420> this

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
this for about a minute or so this

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.490 
this for about a minute or so this
recipe<00:04:01.690> makes<00:04:02.580> seven<00:04:03.580> cups<00:04:04.170> each<00:04:05.170> cup

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
recipe makes seven cups each cup

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.230 
recipe makes seven cups each cup
totaling<00:04:06.010> less<00:04:06.370> than<00:04:07.140> 59<00:04:08.310> calories<00:04:09.310> so<00:04:10.000> it's

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
totaling less than 59 calories so it's

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.630 
totaling less than 59 calories so it's
an<00:04:10.390> excellent<00:04:10.870> meal<00:04:11.170> replacement<00:04:11.770> excellent

now this is a green shake right here and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.540 
now this is a green shake right here and
it's<00:04:25.510> amazing<00:04:25.750> because<00:04:25.990> most<00:04:26.980> people<00:04:27.370> think

that green some movies are terrible and

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.560 
that green some movies are terrible and
I<00:04:29.620> understand<00:04:30.070> because<00:04:30.310> then<00:04:31.090> we<00:04:31.300> need<00:04:31.480> to

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
I understand because then we need to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.110 
I understand because then we need to
build<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:32.020> exact<00:04:32.350> measurements<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:33.190> recipes

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
build the exact measurements and recipes

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.690 
build the exact measurements and recipes
on<00:04:34.570> how<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.810> make<00:04:35.020> these<00:04:35.200> things<00:04:35.260> but<00:04:35.830> once<00:04:36.520> you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
on how to make these things but once you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.820
