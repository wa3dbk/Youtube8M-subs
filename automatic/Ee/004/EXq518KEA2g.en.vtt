00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.639
 World children who can not go to school 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:21.140
 There are many children in the world who can not go to school 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:29.919
 The number is 67 million, which is more than half of 127 million in Japan 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.919
 In the southern countries of the Saharan Desert on the African continent , 1 in 5 children do not go to school 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:40.200
 Why so many children can not go to school 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:49.620
 There are many poor countries in the world 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:54.530
 In poor countries, older children take care of younger brothers and sisters, help with field work, and are far from home 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:01.510
 We do work to get important water to the place 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.510
 I am busy helping with my work at home so I don't have time to go to school 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 In poor countries there are few schools and there are no schools near the house so I can not go to schools 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.100
 Because the number of teachers is also very small 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:23.270
 One teacher teaches many parties 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.950
 I will teach outside where there is no school building 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 There is also no Kamiya pencil 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:40.300
 There are 800,000 children working in the military around the world 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:43.909
 Of course, children fighting in war don't go to school 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:50.720
 What if I can not go to school ? 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:54.860
 If you can not go to school, you can not read or write characters as an adult 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.560
 Then I can not get important information 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.560
 I can not do a job to get a lot of money 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:09.170
 America and Japan are very rich countries where all children can go to school 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:16.480
 I'm lucky 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.480
 What can we do for the poor children?
