application is very easy and if you need

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
application is very easy and if you need
to<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.289> an<00:00:49.410> application<00:00:49.559> demo<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.730> can

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
to see in an application demo you can

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.580 
to see in an application demo you can
check<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.570> other<00:00:51.690> videos<00:00:52.289> so

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
check out some of my other videos so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.450 
check out some of my other videos so
this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.940> three<00:00:54.390> part<00:00:54.690> case<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
this is a three part case just like the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.150 
this is a three part case just like the
linear<00:00:56.850> crystal<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.739> only<00:00:58.920> difference

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
linear crystal and the only difference

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.479 
linear crystal and the only difference
really<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.530> crystal<00:01:02.100> version

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
really here is that the crystal version

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
really here is that the crystal version
had<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> clear<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
had a clear back and this one is a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.640 
had a clear back and this one is a
colored<00:01:05.610> full<00:01:06.150> back<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> won't<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.590> able

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
colored full back so you won't be able

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.740 
colored full back so you won't be able
to<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.920> through<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.549> i<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.630> will

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to see through it but i think it will

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.660 
to see through it but i think it will
definitely<00:01:09.960> help<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> scratches<00:01:11.490> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
definitely help with the scratches that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.020 
definitely help with the scratches that
were<00:01:12.119> prone<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.200> crystal<00:01:13.560> version<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
were prone to the crystal version so the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
were prone to the crystal version so the
application<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> case<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.530> exactly<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
application of the case is exactly the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.820 
application of the case is exactly the
same<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.240> three<00:01:18.509> part<00:01:18.720> case<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
same it's a three part case where the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.580 
same it's a three part case where the
linear<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.659> easiest<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
linear back just it's easiest if you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.160 
linear back just it's easiest if you
just<00:01:22.710> hold<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.340> place<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.970> take<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> top

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
just hold it in place and take the top

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
just hold it in place and take the top
and<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:25.619> sure<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.159> line<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and make sure you line it up with the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
and make sure you line it up with the
sleep/wake<00:01:27.960> button<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> top<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
sleep/wake button on the top there and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.090 
sleep/wake button on the top there and
it<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:30.990> tricky<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.680> just

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it can be a little bit tricky but just

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.649 
it can be a little bit tricky but just
make<00:01:32.280> sure<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.579> put<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> side

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
make sure you put it right to the side

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
make sure you put it right to the side
and<00:01:34.220> all<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.820> make<00:01:35.939> sure<00:01:35.970> it's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
and all you do is just make sure it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
and all you do is just make sure it's
lined<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.659> put<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.350> bit<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> pressure<00:01:37.829> on

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
lined up put a little bit of pressure on

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:38.480 
lined up put a little bit of pressure on
it

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.120 
it
so<00:01:38.640> it'll<00:01:38.909> slide<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so it'll slide in just like that and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
so it'll slide in just like that and
what<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.720> flip<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.229> right

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
what I like to do is just flip it right

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.639 
what I like to do is just flip it right
over<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.299> take<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.479> bottom<00:01:45.899> piece<00:01:46.110> there

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
over and take that bottom piece there

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.560 
over and take that bottom piece there
it<00:01:46.860> does<00:01:47.070> also<00:01:47.250> come<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> silver<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.299> or

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it does also come with a silver one or

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.870 
it does also come with a silver one or
to<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> corresponding<00:01:49.920> color<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.640> buy

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to the corresponding color that you buy

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.300 
to the corresponding color that you buy
you<00:01:51.479> stick<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.140> side<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.890> clip

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you stick it on one side and just clip

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950 
you stick it on one side and just clip
it<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.670> other<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.119> you'll<00:01:54.210> feel<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.570> clip

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it on the other and you'll feel it clip

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.740 
it on the other and you'll feel it clip
in<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> install<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.719> very

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
in and that is it so the install is very

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.319 
in and that is it so the install is very
easy<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:59.100> looks<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.520> good<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.090> is

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
easy and it looks really good this is

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.209 
easy and it looks really good this is
the<00:02:00.509> gold<00:02:00.780> version<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> pretty

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the gold version and this is pretty

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
the gold version and this is pretty
unique<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.880> thought<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> looked<00:02:03.479> really<00:02:03.689> good

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
unique I thought it looked really good

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.440 
unique I thought it looked really good
on<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.649> black<00:02:05.009> iPhone<00:02:05.490> 5<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.969> well<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
on the black iPhone 5 as well and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
on the black iPhone 5 as well and
definitely<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.409> scratches<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.069> much<00:02:08.399> much

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
definitely the scratches are much much

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.780 
definitely the scratches are much much
better<00:02:08.970> than<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.080> linear<00:02:10.679> crystal<00:02:11.400> version

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
better than the linear crystal version

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.520 
better than the linear crystal version
so<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> way<00:02:13.050> this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so I really like the way this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.460 
so I really like the way this
and<00:02:13.860> I'll<00:02:14.580> show<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:14.970> here<00:02:15.540> what<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.050> crystal

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and I'll show you here what the crystal

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.070 
and I'll show you here what the crystal
version<00:02:16.800> looked<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:18.930> also

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
version looked like and you can also

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.200 
version looked like and you can also
check<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.620> video<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.310> well<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.970> did<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
check that video out as well for I did a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.200 
check that video out as well for I did a
review<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.670> tell<00:02:23.910> that

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
review on that and you can tell that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.750 
review on that and you can tell that
this<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.600> clear<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.380> does<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.860> pretty

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
this is clear and it does have pretty

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.310 
this is clear and it does have pretty
good<00:02:26.940> amount<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.270> scratches<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.140> back

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
good amount of scratches on the back

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.400 
good amount of scratches on the back
which<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:29.010> one<00:02:29.250> alleviates<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.840> overall

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
which this one alleviates so overall

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.710 
which this one alleviates so overall
there's<00:02:31.740> really<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.370> many<00:02:32.820> changes<00:02:33.240> here

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
there's really not many changes here

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
there's really not many changes here
from<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> linear<00:02:34.530> crystal<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> iPhone<00:02:35.730> 5

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
from the linear crystal for the iPhone 5

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.290 
from the linear crystal for the iPhone 5
but<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.810> one<00:02:36.990> carries<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.860> entire<00:02:38.300> metallic

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
but this one carries the entire metallic

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.330 
but this one carries the entire metallic
finish<00:02:39.660> look<00:02:39.959> through<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.620> entire<00:02:41.010> case

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
finish look through the entire case

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.370 
finish look through the entire case
which<00:02:41.910> some<00:02:42.150> people<00:02:42.420> might<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.870> because

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
which some people might like because

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.680 
which some people might like because
some<00:02:43.680> people<00:02:43.980> did<00:02:44.130> not<00:02:44.310> like<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:45.090> plastic

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
some people did not like the plastic

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.660 
some people did not like the plastic
back<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.110> was<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.380> there<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:47.070> all<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> ports

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
back that was on there but all the ports

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
back that was on there but all the ports
are<00:02:47.820> good<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:49.140> buttons<00:02:49.709> are<00:02:49.860> very

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
are good and the buttons are very

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.100 
are good and the buttons are very
tactile<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.239> can<00:02:51.390> see<00:02:51.540> here<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.900> some

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
tactile and you can see here is some

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.260 
tactile and you can see here is some
people<00:02:52.410> really<00:02:52.739> might<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.730> flat

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
people really might like this flat

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.170 
people really might like this flat
finish<00:02:54.959> look<00:02:55.260> throughout<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.190> case<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
finish look throughout the case and I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.870 
finish look throughout the case and I
think<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.510> looks<00:02:57.660> very<00:02:57.810> good<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.520> can<00:02:59.550> tell

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
think it looks very good so you can tell

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.270 
think it looks very good so you can tell
here<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.300> there<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.080> no<00:03:01.230> flex<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.100> case

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
here that there is no flex in this case

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.970 
here that there is no flex in this case
whatsoever<00:03:02.640> no<00:03:03.300> creeks<00:03:03.780> or<00:03:03.989> anything<00:03:04.410> very

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
whatsoever no creeks or anything very

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.580 
whatsoever no creeks or anything very
very<00:03:05.340> solid<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.720> only<00:03:06.900> thing<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.470> I've

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
very solid and the only thing that I've

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.560 
very solid and the only thing that I've
noticed<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.190> these<00:03:08.370> cases<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.180> if<00:03:09.420> you

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
noticed with these cases is that if you

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.780 
noticed with these cases is that if you
were<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.840> have<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.050> really<00:03:10.530> hard<00:03:10.860> drop<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
were to have a really hard drop on the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.260 
were to have a really hard drop on the
surface<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:13.350> might<00:03:13.680> come<00:03:13.890> apart<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.940> read

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
surface this might come apart and I read

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.509 
surface this might come apart and I read
that<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.050> seen<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.709> in<00:03:16.890> some<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.100> them<00:03:17.340> I

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
that and seen that in some of them I

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.000 
that and seen that in some of them I
have<00:03:17.910> dropped<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.510> case<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.110> couple<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.709> times

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
have dropped this case a couple of times

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.310 
have dropped this case a couple of times
especially<00:03:20.760> with<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.269> crystal<00:03:21.660> version<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
especially with the crystal version and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.160 
especially with the crystal version and
I<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.920> not<00:03:23.190> had<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.459> come<00:03:23.640> apart<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.840> never

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
I have not had to come apart but I never

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.470 
I have not had to come apart but I never
had<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> really<00:03:25.769> hit<00:03:26.130> concrete<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:27.239> that

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
had it really hit concrete but that

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.090 
had it really hit concrete but that
might<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.959> only<00:03:28.019> thing<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.860> may

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
might be the only thing that you may

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.039 
might be the only thing that you may
need<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.519> know<00:03:29.549> about<00:03:29.970> these<00:03:30.239> cases<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
need to know about these cases is that
