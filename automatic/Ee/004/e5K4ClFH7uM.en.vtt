four-channel analog or MIDI controlled
this<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.740> MIDI<00:02:10.979> log<00:02:11.250> mixer<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.569> use

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
this was a MIDI log mixer so I can use

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600 
this was a MIDI log mixer so I can use
this<00:02:12.810> control<00:02:13.200> my<00:02:13.319> software<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.459> it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
this control my software or I can use it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.270 
this control my software or I can use it
to<00:02:14.930> basically<00:02:15.930> be<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> real<00:02:16.350> mixer<00:02:16.709> which<00:02:17.190> is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
to basically be a real mixer which is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.820 
to basically be a real mixer which is
what<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.490> currently<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.440> your<00:02:19.560> effect

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
what I currently do you have your effect

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.560 
what I currently do you have your effect
controls<00:02:20.220> basically<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.940> either<00:02:21.090> side<00:02:21.420> right

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
controls basically on either side right

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.810 
controls basically on either side right
here<00:02:21.750> either<00:02:22.470> deck<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.950> taking<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.640> MIDI

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
here either deck is taking the MIDI

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.630 
here either deck is taking the MIDI
controller<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.540> that's<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:26.250> either<00:02:26.340> side

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
controller and that's it for either side

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.570 
controller and that's it for either side
the<00:02:27.150> middle<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.780> analog<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.800> MIDI<00:02:29.100> at<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the middle is analog and MIDI at the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.540 
the middle is analog and MIDI at the
same<00:02:29.730> time<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.180> media<00:02:30.420> log<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:32.370> it's

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
same time so it's media log but it's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.010 
same time so it's media log but it's
still<00:02:32.730> lightweight<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.600> not<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.840> heavy

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
still lightweight it's not that heavy

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.160 
still lightweight it's not that heavy
compared<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.650> 10<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> 7<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.340> not<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.610> heavy

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
compared to a 10 a 7 it's not that heavy

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.840 
compared to a 10 a 7 it's not that heavy
this<00:02:37.170> thing<00:02:37.350> weighs<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.530> barely<00:02:38.520> anything

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
this thing weighs like barely anything

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.460 
this thing weighs like barely anything
this<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.150> about<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.900> everything<00:02:40.140> in

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
this is about if you have everything in

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.530 
this is about if you have everything in
your<00:02:40.560> rack<00:02:40.790> which<00:02:41.790> will<00:02:41.820> leave<00:02:42.090> up<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.300> this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
your rack which will leave up to this

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.800 
your rack which will leave up to this
put<00:02:42.989> into<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:44.130> everything<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.519> drag<00:02:44.810> this

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
put into you everything you drag this

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.900 
put into you everything you drag this
weighs<00:02:46.019> less<00:02:46.260> than<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:46.560> rack<00:02:46.790> weight<00:02:47.790> small

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
weighs less than your rack weight small

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.150 
weighs less than your rack weight small
beginning<00:02:48.840> 18<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.709> 25<00:02:50.010> pounds<00:02:51.860> not<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.010> much

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
beginning 18 to 25 pounds not that much

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040 
beginning 18 to 25 pounds not that much
at<00:02:53.280> all<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.820> all<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.150> do<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.540> throw<00:02:54.840> us<00:02:55.019> on
