way that is much more refined than you
would<00:01:59.600> normally<00:01:59.630> see<00:01:59.959> a<00:02:00.109> sort<00:02:00.439> of<00:02:00.499> like<00:02:00.619> a

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
would normally see a sort of like a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.649 
would normally see a sort of like a
flannel<00:02:00.950> shirt<00:02:01.100> event<00:02:01.639> so<00:02:01.819> you<00:02:02.240> know<00:02:02.359> that<00:02:02.569> the

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
flannel shirt event so you know that the

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.269 
flannel shirt event so you know that the
back<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:02.869> very<00:02:03.200> simple<00:02:03.469> but<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.859> front<00:02:04.130> is

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.279 
back is very simple but the front is

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.699 
back is very simple but the front is
very<00:02:04.490> beautifully<00:02:05.029> constructed<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.049> I

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
very beautifully constructed and and I

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.139 
very beautifully constructed and and I
think<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.039> sort<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.429> is<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.939> good

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
think that that sort of is a good

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.550 
think that that sort of is a good
marriage<00:02:08.300> between<00:02:08.599> punk<00:02:09.049> and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
marriage between punk and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.110 
marriage between punk and
and<00:02:09.679> refinement<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.520> think<00:02:10.910> you've<00:02:11.000> achieved

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
and refinement I think you've achieved

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.630 
and refinement I think you've achieved
so<00:02:11.930> beautifully<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.800> idea<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> grunge

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
so beautifully the idea of the grunge

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.300 
so beautifully the idea of the grunge
flannel<00:02:14.270> shirt<00:02:14.630> but<00:02:15.319> feminized<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.130> with<00:02:16.220> that

flannel shirt but feminized it with that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.640 
flannel shirt but feminized it with that
front<00:02:16.910> draping<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.660> ruffle<00:02:18.020> beautifully
