00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.080 

okay<00:00:04.080> so<00:00:04.140> I've<00:00:04.440> got<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.680> intake<00:00:05.609> valve<00:00:05.970> on

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
okay so I've got the intake valve on

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.499 
okay so I've got the intake valve on
cylinder<00:00:09.090> number<00:00:10.040> five<00:00:11.120> I've<00:00:12.120> got<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
cylinder number five I've got the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.099 
cylinder number five I've got the
exhaust<00:00:12.840> opening<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.420> so<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> intake<00:00:15.900> should

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
exhaust opening and so the intake should

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.510 
exhaust opening and so the intake should
be<00:00:16.260> closed<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:19.050> trying<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.590> measure<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
be closed so I'm trying to measure to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
be closed so I'm trying to measure to
see<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:20.730> much<00:00:20.970> preload<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
see how much preload I have on the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.840 
see how much preload I have on the
lifters<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.279> have<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.550> push

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
lifters to see if I have the right push

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.800 
lifters to see if I have the right push
rod<00:00:24.029> length<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:26.510> just<00:00:27.510> wanna<00:00:27.689> make<00:00:27.720> sure

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
rod length and I just wanna make sure

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.370 
rod length and I just wanna make sure
I'm<00:00:28.050> doing<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:29.449> because<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.050> have

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I'm doing this right because it I have

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.520 
I'm doing this right because it I have
way<00:00:31.650> too<00:00:31.679> much<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:32.640> because

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
way too much because I think because

getting it nice and warm it has a I mean
it's<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:44.450> bad<00:00:45.450> noise<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.800> like

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
it's just a bad noise it's just like

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
it's just a bad noise it's just like
clanking<00:00:47.489> honestly<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.930> hear<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
clanking honestly like I can hear if I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.610 
clanking honestly like I can hear if I
kind<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> accelerate<00:00:50.329> if<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
kind of accelerate if I have like a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.520 
kind of accelerate if I have like a
metal<00:00:53.399> bridge<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:54.539> metal<00:00:54.870> rails<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
metal bridge like metal rails up on a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.979 
metal bridge like metal rails up on a
bridge<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.579> both<00:00:56.850> sides<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.360> hear<00:00:57.840> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
bridge on both sides I can hear it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.740 
bridge on both sides I can hear it's
like<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> clanking<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.030> it's<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
like a clanking and it's I know it's a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.380 
like a clanking and it's I know it's a
valve<00:01:00.930> train<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:03.260> I'm<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.680> sure<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:06.150> why

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
valve train and I'm just not sure of why

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.090 
valve train and I'm just not sure of why
because<00:01:06.810> every<00:01:07.049> time<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.350> measure<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:07.770> coming

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
because every time I measure I'm coming

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.080 
because every time I measure I'm coming
up<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:08.549> 80,000<00:01:09.360> preload<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
up with about 80,000 preload which is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.530 
up with about 80,000 preload which is
fine<00:01:12.090> I've<00:01:12.600> heard<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.260> ls7<00:01:13.799> lifters<00:01:14.540> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
fine I've heard with the ls7 lifters so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
fine I've heard with the ls7 lifters so
I'm<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> show<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> method<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> make

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
I'm going to show you the method to make

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.030 
I'm going to show you the method to make
sure<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:17.909> doing<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> correctly

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.300 

okay<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.310> have<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.299> zero<00:01:26.630> lash<00:01:27.070> have<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
okay I have it on zero lash have the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.830 
okay I have it on zero lash have the
rocker<00:01:29.180> arm<00:01:29.420> at<00:01:29.570> zero<00:01:29.780> lash<00:01:30.610> so<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.330> 22

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
rocker arm at zero lash so I it's a 22

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.719 
rocker arm at zero lash so I it's a 22
foot<00:01:33.049> pounds<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:33.619> what<00:01:33.649> torque<00:01:34.189> wrench<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.520> set

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
foot pounds is what torque wrench is set

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:48.390 
foot pounds is what torque wrench is set
at<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:36.020> I'm<00:01:36.080> going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.229> go<00:01:36.670> quarter<00:01:42.490> half

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.469 

3/4

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.459 

one

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.410 

one<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.340> quarter

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.400 

one<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> half

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.880 

and<00:02:09.690> almost<00:02:10.690> one<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.140> three<00:02:11.170> quarters<00:02:13.350> so

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.300 

let's<00:02:17.890> say<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.700> three<00:02:18.910> quarters<00:02:20.310> that

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
let's say one in three quarters that

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.100 
let's say one in three quarters that
would<00:02:22.210> put<00:02:22.570> me<00:02:22.810> at<00:02:23.440> about<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.730> think<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.690> if

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
would put me at about I think it's if

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.850 
would put me at about I think it's if
I've<00:02:26.260> done<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.530> math<00:02:26.650> correctly<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.370> 80<00:02:27.760> mm

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
I've done the math correctly it's 80 mm

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.020 
I've done the math correctly it's 80 mm
preload<00:02:29.860> which<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:33.040> doesn't<00:02:33.430> seem<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.850> it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
preload which it doesn't seem like it

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.660 
preload which it doesn't seem like it
should<00:02:34.210> make<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.540> kind<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.870> noise<00:02:34.930> with<00:02:35.410> that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
should make that kind of noise with that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.300 
should make that kind of noise with that
preload<00:02:36.670> setting<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.620> don't<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.740> though<00:02:38.950> I'm

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
preload setting I don't know though I'm

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.680 
preload setting I don't know though I'm
thinking<00:02:39.370> about<00:02:39.820> trying<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.210> seven<00:02:40.540> point

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
thinking about trying a seven point

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.720 
thinking about trying a seven point
three<00:02:41.880> seven<00:02:42.880> five<00:02:43.410> push<00:02:44.410> rod<00:02:44.710> what<00:02:45.430> I've<00:02:45.550> got

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
three seven five push rod what I've got

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.030 
three seven five push rod what I've got
in<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:45.970> are<00:02:46.090> seven<00:02:46.810> point<00:02:47.110> four<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:49.680> I'm<00:02:50.680> not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
in it are seven point four so I'm not

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.290 
in it are seven point four so I'm not
sure<00:02:51.280> I'm<00:02:51.460> just<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.760> post<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.120> video

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
sure I'm just going to post this video

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.970 
sure I'm just going to post this video
up<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.570> see<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.810> guys<00:02:53.050> think<00:02:53.410> make<00:02:53.740> sure<00:02:53.920> I'm
