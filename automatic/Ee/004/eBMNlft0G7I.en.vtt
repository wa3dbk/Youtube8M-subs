snaking before this one popped up of

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:44.720 
snaking before this one popped up of
course<00:03:43.739> we<00:03:43.859> had<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.010> have<00:03:44.129> a<00:03:44.280> color<00:03:44.519> display

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
here and some other things but I mean

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.860 
here and some other things but I mean
speed<00:03:47.459> we<00:03:47.760> got<00:03:47.879> to<00:03:47.970> argue<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.450> speed<00:03:48.750> is

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
speed we got to argue that speed is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.000 
speed we got to argue that speed is
probably<00:03:49.049> one<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.439> more<00:03:49.590> important

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
probably one of the more important

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.970 
probably one of the more important
