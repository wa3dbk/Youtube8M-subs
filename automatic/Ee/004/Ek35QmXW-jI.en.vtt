00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.050
 at 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.470

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.270
 nickel 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.200
 new video on gta 5 online for a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.750
 new slips so looked at the first 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.740
 part is the saying is the little 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.419
 waele place breach that I you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.380
 had shown in the team this tower the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.270
 previous video 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.470
 but thanks to this guide certain person 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.840
 did not know him and could 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.530
 discover a little secret room in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.149
 the team this tower 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
 so little secret room that we are 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.120
 really not bad for being trolls and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.989
 online mode players or any 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.730
 simply your friends 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.580

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.130
 go see that frankly that's 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.360
 really a little goal really finished you 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.920
 can as I wanted said role and not 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.910
 badly of people or so present if 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.230
 you put a bonus on your head or 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.730
 what are you going to hide quickly at 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.950
 inside and you will earn that money 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.900
 at the kc part look i just went up 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.550
 on the small the small ceiling 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.750
 the store team look not up balls at 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.079
 alexi i do not know what he did he has 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.189
 bugged already crossed the wall what has been 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.689
 so here it's like the old video 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.520
 look here I'm going to speed up and I 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.170
 going to have to actually go back in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.909
 the angle that has just here hop there 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 I accelerate I turn around I you 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.130
 advise the little time that right so 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.870
 you are doing to the left 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.050
 your character that he tries on the bike 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.250
 can fall we will say to the fallout in 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.540
 done on the road and you will have everything 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.979
 restart 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.870
 hopper look here we come for sure 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.400
 on the small ceiling of the clips 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.540
 sound that's right here like we 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.250
 know a glitch for now nothing has 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.110
 changed just waiting for alex us 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.940
 join here is the dish you just need 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 that he turns around and in fact we go for 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.200
 go behind the windows of the team this 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.340
 tower so the windows that has hobo at 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 ground floor during when you 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.400
 go back to your apartment 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 not by your garage but by the door 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.580
 entrance look right here we have them 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.900
 small windows case from the side and you 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.070
 can have fun putting yourself 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.810
 behind his windows 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.799
 frankly it's really finished the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.960
 look first of all you 're going to have to 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.150
 walk here like me in the video the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 know how to get down then I 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.670
 advise you to move in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.500
 aiming with a weapon 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.060
 little advice if I find that it's 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.560
 much more accurate 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.729
 there you're going to have to head as 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.490
 me in the video look there I 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.750
 walked on the glass that just right here and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.959
 at the last moment actually I'm going to have to 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.849
 move back and forth Alexis he did 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.680
 anything but he managed by 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.500
 against then he moved back and he's 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.090
 fell and I asked him actually 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.689
 not be below me for that 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.609
 I can arrive 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.260
 and instead of going to the left or the 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.050
 right and the remote and that did it 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.970
 fall into a black hole 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.400
 there actually look at what is really 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.090
 easy you will want to back off and as soon as 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.370
 you feel that your character 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.050
 begins to fall or descend for 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.430
 advance your joystick to stick the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.770
 window like me in the video look 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.660
 up and there I'm placed behind the window 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.610
 there I saw expect that xxx arrives 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.010
 for me you to show you already 2 1 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.600
 who see me and two that behind 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.550
 this little window I am invincible 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.380
 that bullets do not pass it's 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.420
 really we'll say a little godmode 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.190
 without being able to piss off the others you 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.750
 is invincible but you can not kill 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.400
 no one no case you're here I'm going to you 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.840
 show that bullets do not pass 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.220
 any case alex must try to kill me 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.950
 you will see that I'm not going 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.080
 lose health so we have 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.370
 made several times the first time 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.870
 I'm going to show squids so I wanted 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.620
 not me in the video you will put 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.720
 maybe at the end of the video 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.920
 I wanted to taunt so I had fun 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.170
 to do the little dance with the guitar 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.670
 guitar and I'm having fun and I taunt 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.990
 young people argued and it's not at the end 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.460
 for a moment I have my head or my arm 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.020
 had to go past he put me a valve and I 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.270
 am dead so if you really want 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.310
 taunt someone to have fun stop 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.470
 role remained as motionless me 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.240
 behind the green the glass and that's that 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.890
 while your hands or your head do not 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.200
 not exceed the pulls out a glass 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.459
 animation otherwise you will die and 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.420
 here we come to the end of this video 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.520
 in any case I really hope that this 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.930
 little manipulation will have pleased you do not hesitate 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.760
 to let go a little central blue thumb 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.200
 really pleasure do not hesitate either 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.550
 to the trolls and a lot of people in 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.440
 online mode I think it can be 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.420
 really finished and here I am, I tell you 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.750
 all edges gainbourg glitch and you have 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.750
 everyone 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.190
 Yes
