00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.309 

first<00:00:00.359> one<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:00.719> to<00:00:00.810> show<00:00:00.930> you<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.140> gonna

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
first one I'm going to show you is gonna

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.840 
first one I'm going to show you is gonna
come<00:00:01.530> around<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.860> right<00:00:02.100> side<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.580> set<00:00:02.760> of

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
come around the right side of a set of

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.970 
come around the right side of a set of
rings<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.300> hopefully<00:00:04.049> hit<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.589> target

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
rings and hopefully hit in the target

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.070 
rings and hopefully hit in the target
there<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.700> line<00:00:05.910> will<00:00:06.180> wrap<00:00:06.390> around<00:00:06.420> and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
there and the line will wrap around and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.709 
there and the line will wrap around and
hit<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.589> spot<00:00:07.799> behind<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:09.150> other<00:00:09.300> one<00:00:09.480> is

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
hit the spot behind it the other one is

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.020 
hit the spot behind it the other one is
going<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.380> strategic<00:00:10.650> cast<00:00:11.160> around<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
going to be a strategic cast around the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.610 
going to be a strategic cast around the
other<00:00:12.240> side<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.719> Rings<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.139> hopefully

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
other side of the Rings and hopefully

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.350 
other side of the Rings and hopefully
hit<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> target<00:00:14.190> behind<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
hit the target behind it so I'm going to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000 
hit the target behind it so I'm going to
show<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.570> those<00:00:16.170> casts<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.740> then<00:00:16.830> I'm<00:00:16.920> going

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
show you those casts and then I'm going

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.439 
show you those casts and then I'm going
to<00:00:17.070> demonstrate<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.789> little<00:00:17.970> bit<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.270> how

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to demonstrate just a little bit on how

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:45.790 
to demonstrate just a little bit on how
to<00:00:18.510> achieve<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.900> effect

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.980 

so<00:00:46.400> that<00:00:46.520> was<00:00:46.640> a<00:00:46.670> demonstration<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.420> bringing

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
so that was a demonstration of bringing

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.690 
so that was a demonstration of bringing
a<00:00:48.050> fly<00:00:48.290> around<00:00:48.350> an<00:00:48.650> obstacle<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:49.640> said

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
a fly around an obstacle and like I said

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.090 
a fly around an obstacle and like I said
that<00:00:49.850> could<00:00:50.060> be<00:00:50.180> sticks<00:00:50.480> trees<00:00:50.810> brush<00:00:51.140> or

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
that could be sticks trees brush or

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.530 
that could be sticks trees brush or
maybe<00:00:52.310> you<00:00:52.460> just<00:00:52.610> want<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> little<00:00:53.240> curve<00:00:53.390> in

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
maybe you just want a little curve in

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.180 
maybe you just want a little curve in
your<00:00:53.600> cast<00:00:53.900> to<00:00:54.260> accommodate<00:00:54.680> some<00:00:54.860> current

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
your cast to accommodate some current

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.190 
your cast to accommodate some current
and<00:00:55.310> get<00:00:55.640> a<00:00:55.670> nice<00:00:55.820> float<00:00:56.090> I<00:00:56.540> would<00:00:56.930> consider

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
and get a nice float I would consider

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.690 
and get a nice float I would consider
that<00:00:57.320> an<00:00:57.530> overpowered<00:00:58.070> curve<00:00:58.310> and<00:00:58.489> what<00:00:58.580> that

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
that an overpowered curve and what that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.490 
that an overpowered curve and what that
means<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.210> in<00:00:59.480> comparison<00:00:59.810> to<00:01:00.050> other<00:01:00.260> reach

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
means is in comparison to other reach

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.350 
means is in comparison to other reach
casts<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.070> you've<00:01:01.280> seen<00:01:01.460> are<00:01:01.610> gonna<00:01:01.700> see<00:01:01.940> the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
casts that you've seen are gonna see the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.299 
casts that you've seen are gonna see the
fly<00:01:02.600> comes<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:03.140> at<00:01:03.260> relatively<00:01:03.680> high<00:01:03.800> speed

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
fly comes in at relatively high speed

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.890 
fly comes in at relatively high speed
which<00:01:04.489> is<00:01:04.520> very<00:01:04.729> accurate<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.720> also

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
which is very accurate and it also

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.440 
which is very accurate and it also
deters<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.100> wind<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.550> you<00:01:07.760> can<00:01:07.970> do<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.240> with

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
deters the wind and you can do that with

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.160 
deters the wind and you can do that with
like<00:01:08.720> indicators<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.770> other<00:01:09.950> weighted<00:01:10.430> flies

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
like indicators and other weighted flies

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.359 
like indicators and other weighted flies
so<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.229> can<00:01:12.410> bring<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.590> fly<00:01:12.920> in<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:13.250> some

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
so you can bring that fly in with some

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.070 
so you can bring that fly in with some
velocity<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:13.970> very<00:01:14.180> very<00:01:14.390> accurate<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:14.990> you

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
velocity is very very accurate and you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.330 
velocity is very very accurate and you
can<00:01:15.229> hook<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.470> around<00:01:15.530> different<00:01:15.800> obstacles

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
can hook it around different obstacles

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.030 
can hook it around different obstacles
the<00:01:16.880> way<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.090> get<00:01:17.420> an<00:01:17.630> over<00:01:18.259> power<00:01:18.470> curve<00:01:18.800> to

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
the way you get an over power curve to

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.620 
the way you get an over power curve to
hook<00:01:19.220> around<00:01:19.550> is<00:01:19.850> going<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.210> be<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.540> I'm<00:01:20.600> going

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
hook around is going to be and I'm going

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.430 
hook around is going to be and I'm going
to<00:01:20.780> try<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:20.930> do<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.259> just<00:01:21.729> impromptu<00:01:22.729> here

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
to try to do this just impromptu here

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.080 
to try to do this just impromptu here
when<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.590> fly<00:01:25.100> comes<00:01:25.399> around<00:01:25.729> or<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:25.940> rod

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
when the fly comes around or the rod

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.160 
when the fly comes around or the rod
comes<00:01:26.330> around<00:01:26.540> you're<00:01:26.630> gonna<00:01:26.720> be<00:01:26.899> at<00:01:26.960> about<00:01:27.050> a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
comes around you're gonna be at about a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.070 
comes around you're gonna be at about a
75%<00:01:27.920> angle<00:01:28.460> your<00:01:29.149> develop<00:01:29.479> some<00:01:29.660> good<00:01:29.840> line

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
75% angle your develop some good line

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.990 
75% angle your develop some good line
speed<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.649> you're<00:01:30.770> gonna<00:01:30.890> make<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.100> hard<00:01:31.490> crisp

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
speed and you're gonna make a hard crisp

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.620 
speed and you're gonna make a hard crisp
stop<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:33.229> hard<00:01:33.619> crisp<00:01:34.009> stop<00:01:34.520> on<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:35.030> 75%

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
stop that hard crisp stop on that 75%

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.219 
stop that hard crisp stop on that 75%
angle<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:36.560> gonna<00:01:37.190> force<00:01:38.149> that<00:01:38.450> fly<00:01:38.750> around<00:01:38.899> in

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
angle is gonna force that fly around in

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.440 
angle is gonna force that fly around in
kind<00:01:39.440> of<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.680> centrifugal<00:01:40.550> fashion<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.420> that

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
kind of a centrifugal fashion and that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.600 
kind of a centrifugal fashion and that
fly<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.840> gonna<00:01:42.080> rotate<00:01:42.320> around<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.009> obstacle

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
fly is gonna rotate around the obstacle

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.550 
fly is gonna rotate around the obstacle
and<00:01:43.790> hopefully<00:01:44.509> land<00:01:44.750> where<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.290> trout's

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and hopefully land where the trout's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.350 
and hopefully land where the trout's
hiding<00:01:46.070> or<00:01:46.340> whatever<00:01:46.610> target<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:47.210> you're

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
hiding or whatever target is you're

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.420 
hiding or whatever target is you're
casting<00:01:47.869> at<00:01:48.020> that's<00:01:48.710> how<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:48.979> would<00:01:49.130> bring<00:01:49.310> it

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
casting at that's how you would bring it

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.910 
casting at that's how you would bring it
around<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.729> right<00:01:49.880> side<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.240> obstacle<00:01:50.860> 75%<00:01:51.860> on

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
around the right side of obstacle 75% on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.669 
around the right side of obstacle 75% on
the<00:01:52.009> rod<00:01:52.160> stroke<00:01:52.520> hard<00:01:53.119> stop<00:01:53.479> let<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.350> fly

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
the rod stroke hard stop let that fly

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.320 
the rod stroke hard stop let that fly
wrap<00:01:54.920> around<00:01:55.250> through<00:01:55.429> centrifugal<00:01:55.940> force

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
wrap around through centrifugal force

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.169
