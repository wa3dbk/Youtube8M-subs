00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.080
 the pond is ice-free the air is relative 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.630
 warm 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 after these extremely cold winters we 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.589
 had 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.089
 would say brittle five degrees plus 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.800
 and of course I have the water 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.929
 I want a lot more today though 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.599
 try here if the carp already 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.480
 are happy 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.290
 I'm just doing it today 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.760
 behind posen montage here i have one 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.080
 I do not have to do a three gram pose 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.860
 I do not necessarily have to 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.280
 to take 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.520
 but I have to throw and shoot relatively accurately 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.950
 then a little bit weight down 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.660
 already advantageous 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.950
 yes and because that's because of your reason 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.840
 I just got muddy here 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.269
 on the hook in smaller or larger 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.850
 Bleischrot mouth clamped 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.289
 that is not so deep one can do with it 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.359
 I then the water depth very well 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:15.569
 determine 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.569
 I have fed with mostly easier 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.789
 Take a thousand times supermarket and 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.789
 Let's see what the carp like 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.149
 even in the primeval times we have to try 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.149
 it out 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:55.540
 I just have the temperature 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.140
 measured as smells in here 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.790
 modest 73 degrees of course that for 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.880
 carp still pretty fresh 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.880
 but perhaps is indeed still a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:04:07.810
 because I purely test the route quite well 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:16.650
 first fight after a long long 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:18.030
 long winter and you have to say that 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.919
 they have a cold time very well 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.740
 survived 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:26.780
 power have so lovely for two, yes 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.780
 is a little five kilo gunther and 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.630
 made
