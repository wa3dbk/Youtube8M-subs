the primary lock on the terminal fails

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
the primary lock on the terminal fails
so<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.770> first<00:01:11.010> thing<00:01:11.190> we're<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.550> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.840 
so the first thing we're going to do is
take<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.910> wide<00:01:12.630> Pig<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> we're<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.580> open

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
take a wide Pig and we're going to open

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.590 
take a wide Pig and we're going to open
a<00:01:15.420> secondary<00:01:15.840> lock<00:01:16.110> from<00:01:16.350> both<00:01:16.560> sides

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.120 

you'll<00:01:24.600> hear<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> distinct<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.350> click<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you'll hear a distinct and click when it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:35.630 
you'll hear a distinct and click when it
releases

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.039 

and<00:01:36.640> then<00:01:36.759> we'll<00:01:36.880> slide<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.149> secondary<00:01:37.810> lock

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
and then we'll slide that secondary lock

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.249 
and then we'll slide that secondary lock
off<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.740> wires<00:01:38.950> like<00:01:39.399> that<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.840> next<00:01:41.109> thing

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
off the wires like that the next thing

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.240 
off the wires like that the next thing
we're<00:01:41.409> going<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.679> do<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.009> we're<00:01:42.100> going<00:01:42.189> to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.600 
we're going to do is we're going to
insert<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.609> small<00:01:43.119> pic<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.799> slot<00:01:45.189> on<00:01:45.490> the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.140 
terminal on the end of the wire and then
pull<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.540> back<00:04:13.570> in<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.340> problem<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:15.910> the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
pull it back in the the problem is the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.520 
pull it back in the the problem is the
crimpers<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.660> are<00:04:16.750> used<00:04:16.900> for<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.200> are<00:04:17.320> very

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
crimpers that are used for this are very

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.560 
crimpers that are used for this are very
small<00:04:17.799> it's<00:04:18.100> it's<00:04:18.580> very<00:04:18.640> easy<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.209> break<00:04:19.390> the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
small it's it's very easy to break the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.969 
small it's it's very easy to break the
terminal<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:20.560> we<00:04:20.769> use<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.900> repair<00:04:22.979> terminal

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
terminal so we use a repair terminal

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.680 
terminal so we use a repair terminal
that<00:04:24.100> has<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.610> terminal<00:04:25.030> Hardy<00:04:25.270> Krypton

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
that has the terminal Hardy Krypton

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.469 
that has the terminal Hardy Krypton
piece<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.620> wire<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:27.640> case<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.090> pull<00:04:28.330> the

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
piece of wire in this case you pull the

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.810 
piece of wire in this case you pull the
wire<00:04:28.630> through<00:04:29.190> lock<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.400> terminal<00:04:30.729> in<00:04:30.790> the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
wire through lock the terminal in the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.490 
wire through lock the terminal in the
housing<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.510> then<00:04:31.600> make<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:31.930> repair<00:04:32.290> back

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
housing and then make you repair back

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.950 
housing and then make you repair back
here<00:04:32.740> by<00:04:32.890> splicing<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.550> white<00:04:33.820> wire<00:04:34.090> onto<00:04:34.510> the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
here by splicing the white wire onto the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.409 
here by splicing the white wire onto the
existing<00:04:35.260> wire<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.190> connector<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:37.270> this

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
existing wire in the connector in this

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.420 
existing wire in the connector in this
case<00:04:37.690> since<00:04:37.960> we're<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:38.140> rinsed<00:04:38.590> reinserting

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
case since we're just rinsed reinserting

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.480 
case since we're just rinsed reinserting
this<00:04:39.580> terminal<00:04:40.390> we<00:04:41.020> will<00:04:41.229> fit<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.130> primary

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
this terminal we will fit the primary

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.860 
this terminal we will fit the primary
lock<00:04:42.700> back<00:04:42.910> up<00:04:43.090> just<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.330> little<00:04:43.360> bit<00:04:43.540> so<00:04:43.720> it's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
lock back up just a little bit so it's

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.290 
lock back up just a little bit so it's
up<00:04:43.990> past<00:04:44.200> flush<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.919> then<00:04:45.520> pull<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.910> terminal

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
up past flush and then pull the terminal

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.500 
up past flush and then pull the terminal
back<00:04:46.450> into<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.870> housing<00:04:47.050> until<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.590> locks<00:04:47.740> and

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
back into the housing until it locks and

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.719 
back into the housing until it locks and
then<00:04:49.510> test<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.990> make<00:04:50.020> sure<00:04:50.169> it's<00:04:50.440> locked<00:04:50.729> we
