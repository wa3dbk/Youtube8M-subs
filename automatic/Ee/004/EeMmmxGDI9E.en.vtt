00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
dark pretty pretty good in size they're

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.440 
dark pretty pretty good in size they're
not<00:02:26.530> too<00:02:26.770> small<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.730> could<00:02:27.880> actually<00:02:28.030> tie

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
not too small so you could actually tie

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.300 
not too small so you could actually tie
it<00:02:28.510> fairly<00:02:28.840> comfortably<00:02:29.380> with<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.280> I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
it fairly comfortably with it and like I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.070 
it fairly comfortably with it and like I
said<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.760> think<00:02:31.150> shares<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.630> some<00:02:31.810> sort<00:02:32.020> of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
said I think shares like some sort of

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.890 
said I think shares like some sort of
magnet<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.610> fairly<00:02:33.970> easy<00:02:34.150> for<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.720> most

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
magnet so it's fairly easy for the most

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.080 
magnet so it's fairly easy for the most
part<00:02:35.200> once<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.400> snap<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.820> in

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
part once you have it so you snap it in

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.360 
part once you have it so you snap it in
and<00:02:37.330> there<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.959> go<00:02:38.110> automatically<00:02:38.920> will<00:02:39.130> just

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and there you go automatically will just

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.790 
and there you go automatically will just
hold<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.820> place<00:02:40.030> like<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:41.290> sparked<00:02:41.590> by<00:02:41.680> an

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800

keyboard dock has a built-in USB port a
full-size<00:02:53.680> one<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.580> had<00:02:54.790> that

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
full-size one so you had that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.640 
full-size one so you had that
flexibility<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.810> functionality<00:02:56.110> of

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
attaching the different purpose to it so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.130 
attaching the different purpose to it so
it<00:02:59.650> has<00:02:59.799> some<00:02:59.980> cool<00:03:00.220> form<00:03:00.700> factors<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.750> price

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
it has some cool form factors the price

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.410 
it has some cool form factors the price
is<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.680> know<00:03:02.830> pretty<00:03:03.070> competitive<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.970> it's
