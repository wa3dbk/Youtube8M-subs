 thanks to the weather we were able to do this 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.240
 stretch that was longer than 1030 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.650
 especially overcoming kilometers 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.660
 and that actually does too 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.440
 speed so you lie a day 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.720
 make 150 kilometers over 200 kilometers 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.450
 then you can be very fast because 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.310
 one on the difficult transitions the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.190

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.350

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.360
 everyone wants a lot of pressure before starting 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.959
 expect me to go that if 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.390
 you already fly 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.510

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:27.830

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.830
