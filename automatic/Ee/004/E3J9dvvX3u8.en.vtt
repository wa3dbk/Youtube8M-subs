 remember metal slug is not classic a 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.430
 idea was playstation 1 a gel anyway a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.040
 different things made from the team 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.680
 also metal slug né 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.150
 in that half -hit kick you can look 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.979
 with up to four characters at the same 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.460
 time you connect four controls to your 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 videogame plays with friends so goes 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.650
 help to pass objective phase well if 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.420
 You're going to go and shoot the robots. 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.470
 so our team and clothes books are 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 robots right 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.100
 and you get the movie, it's easy for you to see 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 How do you grove a business that will 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.240
 give a reward then you can 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 evolve through newspapers touching their weapons 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.690
 changing clothes armor picking up 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 special skills 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.370
 Finally you will give upgrade your 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.340
 character is one he said that the rp one 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.300
 kick is basically because you 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.100
 can evolve 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.350
 You have a map where you follow. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.600
 the phases you have been doing less and less 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 stronger or challenge will 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.920
 consequently increasing as 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.960
 you will pass in the prep pb guns 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.180
 special but more powerful we'll say 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.680
 cinema and I played really fun game 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.260
 It's really worth your while. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.780
 dropping by almost 40 megs it guarantees 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.030
 that everyone should have spaces in their 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.070
 4GB console must have a espaçozinho 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.869
 4gb low pen drive game worth the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.959

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.269
 It's hard to find a good one to have fun. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.709
