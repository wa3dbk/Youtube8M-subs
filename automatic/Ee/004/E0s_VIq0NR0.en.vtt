00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
relative that means that the score is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
relative that means that the score is
actually<00:01:46.619> increasing<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:47.670> 5<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.360> being

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
actually increasing by 5 not just being

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
actually increasing by 5 not just being
set<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.810> 5<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> didn't<00:01:50.250> check

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
set to 5 because if I didn't check

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.700 
set to 5 because if I didn't check
relative<00:01:50.880> every<00:01:51.090> time<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> got<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> guy

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
relative every time I got a guy

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.130 
relative every time I got a guy
my<00:01:51.950> score<00:01:52.250> would<00:01:52.310> be<00:01:52.370> set<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.700> five<00:01:52.909> oh<00:01:53.240> yes

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
my score would be set to five oh yes

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.210 
my score would be set to five oh yes
it's<00:01:54.950> going<00:01:55.190> five<00:01:55.369> ten<00:01:55.670> fifteen<00:01:56.150> etc<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.740> let's

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
it's going five ten fifteen etc so let's

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.280 
it's going five ten fifteen etc so let's
run<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.030> less<00:01:59.240> test<00:01:59.570> students<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.140> make<00:02:00.260> sure

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
run that less test students to make sure

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.340 
run that less test students to make sure
we<00:02:00.530> get<00:02:00.619> five<00:02:00.860> points<00:02:01.070> per<00:02:01.250> lb<00:02:01.400> diamonds<00:02:05.350> here

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
we get five points per lb diamonds here

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.430 
we get five points per lb diamonds here
we<00:02:06.470> go<00:02:06.650> first<00:02:07.400> time<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.330> have<00:02:08.450> five<00:02:08.660> five

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
we go first time in a we have five five

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.760 
we go first time in a we have five five
points<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.270> another<00:02:11.270> diamond<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.989> ten

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
points and another diamond and ten

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.590 
points and another diamond and ten
points<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:14.060> we've<00:02:14.270> done<00:02:14.450> our<00:02:14.959> diamond<00:02:15.709> score

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
points so we've done our diamond score

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.260 
points so we've done our diamond score
now<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.660> want<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.930> give<00:02:18.640> twenty<00:02:19.640> five<00:02:19.790> points

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
now I want to give twenty five points

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.540 
now I want to give twenty five points

gratulations<00:03:04.189> on<00:03:04.609> being<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.939> level<00:03:05.680> look

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
gratulations on being the level look

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.000 
gratulations on being the level look
okay<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.870> remember<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.530> had<00:03:09.739> this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
okay and you remember that we had this

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.390 
okay and you remember that we had this
go<00:03:10.879> to<00:03:10.939> next<00:03:11.269> room<00:03:11.480> if<00:03:11.629> the<00:03:11.719> next<00:03:11.930> room<00:03:12.400> exists

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
go to next room if the next room exists

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.339 
go to next room if the next room exists
and<00:03:14.019> we<00:03:15.019> want<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:16.030> have<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.269> do<00:03:17.810> both<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.049> these

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
and we want to have it do both of these

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.050 
and we want to have it do both of these
things<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:20.060> we<00:03:20.780> go<00:03:21.139> to<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.650> control<00:03:22.159> and<00:03:22.430> you

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
things so we go to this control and you

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.089 
things so we go to this control and you
see<00:03:23.239> these<00:03:23.389> two<00:03:23.599> triangles<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.409> I<00:03:24.859> want<00:03:25.040> to

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
see these two triangles and I want to

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.470 
see these two triangles and I want to
drag<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.489> first<00:03:25.879> triangle<00:03:26.859> right<00:03:27.859> here<00:03:27.889> and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
drag this first triangle right here and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.410 
drag this first triangle right here and
this<00:03:29.480> next<00:03:29.810> triangle<00:03:30.370> right<00:03:31.370> here<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:32.239> so

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
this next triangle right here and so

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.210 
this next triangle right here and so
that<00:03:32.780> means<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.170> everything<00:03:33.409> between<00:03:33.709> these

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
that means is everything between these

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.929 
that means is everything between these
two<00:03:34.609> triangles<00:03:34.939> is<00:03:35.540> going<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.280> happen<00:03:37.280> if<00:03:37.760> the

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
two triangles is going to happen if the

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.339 
two triangles is going to happen if the
next<00:03:38.150> room<00:03:38.269> exists<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:38.930> if<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.049> next<00:03:39.200> room

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
next room exists so if the next room

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.740 
next room exists so if the next room
exists<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.829> display<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.250> message<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.480> go<00:03:41.689> to

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
exists I display the message and go to

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.490 
exists I display the message and go to
the<00:03:41.840> next<00:03:42.019> room

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
the next room

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.890 
the next room
and<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.489> else<00:03:43.669> member<00:03:44.180> ends<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.720> game

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and then the else member ends the game

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.129 
and then the else member ends the game
but<00:03:45.859> I<00:03:45.889> also<00:03:46.069> want<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:47.659> we<00:03:47.750> have<00:03:47.900> what<00:03:48.049> we

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
but I also want to and we have what we

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.479 
but I also want to and we have what we
want<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.379> show<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> high<00:03:48.799> score<00:03:49.069> table<00:03:49.219> right

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
want to show a high score table right

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.879 
want to show a high score table right
right<00:03:50.139> so<00:03:51.139> we<00:03:51.620> use<00:03:52.340> these<00:03:52.579> triangles<00:03:53.180> again

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
right so we use these triangles again

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.789 
right so we use these triangles again
drag<00:03:54.889> start<00:03:55.310> dragon<00:03:55.879> end<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.659> to<00:03:57.379> show<00:03:57.590> that<00:03:57.620> I

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
drag start dragon end and to show that I

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.080 
drag start dragon end and to show that I
score<00:03:58.129> we<00:03:58.250> go<00:03:58.370> into<00:03:58.519> this<00:03:58.700> score<00:03:59.230> and<00:04:00.230> we<00:04:00.560> have

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
score we go into this score and we have

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.759 
score we go into this score and we have
this<00:04:02.090> show<00:04:02.450> high<00:04:02.659> score<00:04:03.019> I'm<00:04:03.169> gonna<00:04:03.319> drag<00:04:03.560> it
