minecraft<00:00:29.400> 1.5.2<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.330> using<00:00:30.869> Forge<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> I'm

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
minecraft 1.5.2 on using Forge so I'm

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
minecraft 1.5.2 on using Forge so I'm
gonna<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> assume<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.040> know<00:00:35.070> how

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
gonna going to assume that you know how

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.069 
gonna going to assume that you know how
to<00:00:37.190> setup<00:00:38.190> Forge<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.930> pretty

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
to setup Forge because it's pretty

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
to setup Forge because it's pretty
simple<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> install<00:00:41.670> 2<00:00:41.790> CMD

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
simple you just get the install 2 CMD

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.160 
simple you just get the install 2 CMD
and<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:42.600> Eclipse<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> equally<00:00:43.710> simple<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
and then Eclipse is equally simple and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
and then Eclipse is equally simple and
then<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.980> once<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.280> set<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.610> well<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.149> would

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
then so once that's set up well I would

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.630 
then so once that's set up well I would
recommend<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.289> setting<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.829> into<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.340> MC

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
recommend you setting it up into an MC

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.020 
recommend you setting it up into an MC
forge<00:00:50.910> folder<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.280> just<00:00:53.280> set<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
forge folder and just set it all up and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
forge folder and just set it all up and
so<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:57.590> whenever<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> want<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so here so that way whenever you want to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.459 
so here so that way whenever you want to
make<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> new<00:00:59.730> mob<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.870> drag<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> drop

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
make a new mob you just drag and drop

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.020 
make a new mob you just drag and drop
this<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.000> copy<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
this in here and copy that in there and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
this in here and copy that in there and
then<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.680> continue<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.799> your

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
then you can just continue with your

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.469 
then you can just continue with your
development<00:01:08.400> without<00:01:08.520> having<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> run<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
development without having to run the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
development without having to run the
install<00:01:09.900> script<00:01:10.080> over<00:01:10.650> again<00:01:12.470> ok<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.500> I'm

mod not many people will stress this but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.179 
mod not many people will stress this but
it<00:01:56.969> does<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.020> way<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.439> order<00:01:59.009> use

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
it does have to be that way in order use

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.469 
it does have to be that way in order use
textures<00:01:59.670> with<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> new<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:03.119> new<00:02:05.479> rendering

sheet<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
sheet so it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.480

finish<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.600> will<00:02:14.630> create<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:16.100> package

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
finish and it will create this package

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.980 
finish and it will create this package
just<00:02:17.000> click<00:02:17.360> just<00:02:17.780> go<00:02:17.990> new<00:02:18.230> class<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.690> where
