00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.229
 after the last uploaded video 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:11.489
 in which you 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.389
 I was talking about a promotion 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.319
 the various games thirteen of the 90 as is usually usual lately in 

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.239
 our time 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.239
 more than one provider thought 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.779
 I forget my commitment 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.779
 with jesús suárez of the stolen tricks 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.490
 here you have me again 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.570
 the explanation of the mojo 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 but taking advantage of the promotions that will take place the store 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.420
 and taking advantage of the promotion of the low 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.610
 beveled once more I'll show you a game that is done with a deck 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.670
 salad 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.070
 this game 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.280
 the stab deck 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.559
 So much is done with the common deck 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.830
 that you can find it if I'm not wrong 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.970
 on the other hand 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.170
 on my channel 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.390
 and you can use it with a Fernandes deck 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.420
 we do not lower year that has it 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.520
 If you observe its properties with this program, it is carried out with much 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.690
 ease 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.110
 with the resignation of the Senate 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 It has a somewhat different format 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690
 but not for that reason more complex 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.490
 for these as he said we are interested not to go down and a knife is going 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.580
 with which to cross and without its moment 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.160
 I have to prepare 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.130
 The deck 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.600
 and a seriousness with which as we will see 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 to give leinster in the eviction 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.720
 osiris in the following realistic way a fan 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.620
 and offers public space choose a letter 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.990
 the stand on demand to the point you want 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.020
 it does not need to be forced 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.910
 you watch as I always say 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.660
 the conditions in which the card is folded little by little each contingent 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.810
 explained 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.740
 observing the letter 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.110
 four of hearts at this time 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.930
 and of the receipts that it receives 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 this website the same position where I am saying that I have not modified 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:11.730
 Your order is to say 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.709
 if the viewer turned the letter 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.169
 in this sense 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.339
 let's be better this way 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.739
 the fan should not move 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.199
 everything which is 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:26.629
 but if the viewer returns the letter to you in the same position that it will be 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.759
 the most common and most competent 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.079
 you must close the fan to the right so that your letters that 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.270
 funny 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.270
 about the field to the viewer 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.009
 may return 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.119
 the letter 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.030
 on the point 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.759
 of what you want 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.539
 at any point in the deck 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.809
 and not only will we keep controlled 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.019
 as always commented thanks to him 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.689
 that is produced 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.959
 in the letter 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.969
 how can you observe very small 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.069
 not satisfied with that 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.599
 even if you wish it in the polis will deliver public to mix 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.269
 postulate that they are not going to kill him 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:09.660
 I remember 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.659
 well done this 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.659
 that's why we see the technical part closer to the eye 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.979
 and they will be back down 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.309
 the base ray liotta 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.309
 for the goverment 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.559
 we can not 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.439
 no we do not owe completely 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.439
 although we do not have much time 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.889
 the case the following at the time of the low 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.439
 palumbo see how it's closed 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.669
 the letter 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.079
 selected should exit 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.079
 approximately one centimeter 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.539
 out to maintain perfect control over it 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.039
 without pretending like posts alba 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.419
 we will hold 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.519
 with a blanket that better controls 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.640
 in fact so old schools to right 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.090
 but that have been given in this case of mosul is cheered from my hand 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.910
 right with which this country the letter to a centimeter 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.679
 and as you can see it is not observed 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.229
 the extraction by mom herself dad 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.279
 so that's why the salambó height 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.440
 with the napkin and then they want to go back 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.740
 the Mossos to achieve this agreement in each case with that 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.529
 when you see on the other side so that the letter does not slip 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.990
 and go back to your place 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.349
 ferrer a good pressure 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.210
 the low 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.629
 for that to happen 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.629
 so that does not happen 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.169
 once back 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.069
 double the napkin 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.210
 so things do not happen inside 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.800
 we have pressures 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.559
 because as you can see here 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:53.039
 we have the escalo 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.039
 photo leaves true a napkin 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.300
 da rocha from here 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.300
 in a legal sense in the knife 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.469
 search is a point 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:06.889
 where 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.889
 you can find the letter 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.580
 and introduce them 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.909
 the knife 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.439
 just london ap the step because the chosen letter 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.199
 we have it extracted 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.460
 out 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.569
 when 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.629
 enter is the knife inwards 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.740
 then take advantage of it for the bidding a la carte to your interior and make your 

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:33.099
 place 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.430
 i always 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.430
 murillo very slowly very little by little 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.569
 to give you the greatest mystery 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.219
 is about 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.659
 and finish breaking 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.499
 Napkin 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:50.460
 just for the place 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.559
 these short courses and show 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.279
 to our spectators 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.909
 we want even looked that exactly 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.449
 for the place where 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.119
 that introduced your letter as you can see its as simple 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.839
 now it is very important 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.639
 it's very simple very simple Monday 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.599
 very fast 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.800
 but it does not mean you should do it quickly 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.400
 calmly fulfilled 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.520
 for 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.689
 I thought it was climate is necessary 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.249
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:29.839
 thank you 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.059
 we are not our phones
