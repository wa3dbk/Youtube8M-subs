00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.259
 in this critical and game vision noted tb we have reviews of 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:04.210
 products 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.210
 confront 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 and it's clear it was bush we started 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.000
 among its good games that few know this time the voice 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.730
 released in 2008 for wii 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.570
 but that did not stop a sequel being made reaching more platforms of 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.130
 lead 2 pretoma all the good of the original 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.230
 and it does not improve you are a gelatinous creature that changes color yes 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.089
 and a couple of years ago they beat the corporation inc evil company that 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.120
 had stolen the color of the world on the island mysterious events make them 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.719
 suspect one thing 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.449
 the comrade plate is back doing his thing and the worst thing is that 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.539
 elections are coming up so they will have to use their 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.170
 ability to absorb color from different sources and restore life to 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.920
 objects inhabitants and buildings although this time the environments are much 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.960
 more extensive and in addition to the mentions to advance in history 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.510
 There are numerous additional tasks that will allow them to obtain improvements 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.420
 elements that should have a certain color 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.720
 so they should take the appropriate obvian to combine the one they take away from 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.550
 certain enemies because now important new avoid being captured foca ere in 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.490
 Water 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.140
 except when they want to hang the color the biggest change is that certain 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.240
 segments develop in horizontal advance in 2d taking interesting 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.040
 riddles the dynamics of the game becomes a victim and more with controls 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.549
 sensitive to movement 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.009
 and someone doing pinky 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.530
 the game score is for you temples 2 this 8 points 5 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.200
 the answer contains some funds from thq is called john fox 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.549
 give yourself trigger in the first person in which in a fictional future the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.680
 America has been the next target of the forces of the great 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.620
 Republic of Korea 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.400
 which after the invasion from north to south has become a power that 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.660
 has conquered other countries like Japan 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.070
 the developers trained in zamora worked with a story written by 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.290
 trucks and in view of the movies where I already paco state so it was 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.220
 Although the premise of the alternative future is not novel, it is well thought out 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.390
 to be the role of the former seafarer americas and when the Korean army reaches its 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.050
 Colorado house are taken prisoner to 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.330
 like many being sent to a concentration camp but after a 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.870
 shock they manage to escape and they join the resistance which will take them to 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.280
 travel different states and facilities weakening the enemy 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.750
 more like a guerrilla than an army which implies that not always 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.650
 they have to shoot like insane however the chances go unnoticed 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.630
 for your enemies or ska punk to go to a strategic position even if you do not 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.709
 worry ain 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.529
 a lot of lead guns 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.569
 explosives machine guns grenades sniper rifles 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.530
 the school campaign 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.360
 and difference from other titles artificial intelligence is not so 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.930
 smart let's say although the multiplayer mode is quite attractive 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.970
 allowing up to 32 participants the basin rating pointed out that 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.899
 will vete confront this 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.899
 7 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.019
 ap 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.840
 one of the pillars of role-playing video games with explicit content has a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.540
 restored 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.250
 it's about clarifying aus 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.020
 you are victims who accompanies your steer or fluently to the mansion 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.459
 of an eccentric scientist 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.039
 Regrettably Mr. Judge is more common Doctor Nutty and takes his 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.549
 loved 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.979
 letting them die slowly in the room clear until a mask 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.909
 demonic speaks to them and tells them that it is the only way to recover yesterday 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.760
 place it on your face undergoes a transformation that gives them tremendous 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.229
 force but still monsters and cadiz of all kinds will try to stop them in 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:34.329
 its role the dialogues are raw and the sherpas like the fights in 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.790
 which if there is no better weapon until their severed limbs will use 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.059
 graphically it is very attractive the displaced art has a lot of style 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.569
 said bloodlines everywhere but the frames per second are not constant what 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.870
 that removes dynamism from the action, and the audio becomes bad 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.840
 mixed and the test difficulty is balanced this will get them killed in 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.129
 certain areas after losing health in others by forcing them 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.919
 often to repeat the last one and endure very slow loading times 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.229
 the original unlockable game or the soundtrack with mastodon metal and 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.059
 lamb of god are motivation the qualification of can point you prepare 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.439
 planned this 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.019
