00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.139
 Earth's winter is usually the time when 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.009
 so many transfer rumors are yours 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.980
 the transition happened quite suddenly and 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.600
 data was unexpected as far as 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.270
 Do negotiations really go fast? 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.029
 in such silence or just because 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.529
 very quickly everything was decided did not have time 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.349
 go to the press but not rumors went here but 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.890
 it's all just rumors but then when 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.630
 the last game was finished on December 8th 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.739
 Immediately they called me Samara and not even 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.230
 bloated responded and signed my 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.510
 quick agreement so no 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 there were no problems and so quickly you 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.950
 decided what it is connected with 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 and Samara know the reasons and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 easily agreed let's say here to play 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.600
 but I always knew it was good 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 good team with a good story and from 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.489
 Sasha Polinka I knew it was good 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 the team the team is good so i 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.240
 I think that I should immediately take 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.650
 ponder 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 now as if I appreciated my physical 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.950
 state of how easy tales 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.570
 get involved in work as i'm ready 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.229
 took a vacation well this is only 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.119
 runs here when the ball was given first so 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.080
 unusual because mrs rest 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.530
 to accommodate and of course the game exercise 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.220
 drawn out collection is so light and thought 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.979
 I think that 2 be heavier in the wings 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.520
 last season in the first stage were 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.770
 foot problems defense injury 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.130
 was there at one of the key defenders 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.840
 salaga you had to change flank you 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.219
 how much can you say that 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.380
 universal soccer players 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.350
 both flank you can close or all the same 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.850
 you feel comfortable playing about a week 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.759
 I can handle it all the same for me 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.950
 there are no problems except Pavlenko 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.079
 some friends may be friends 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.939
 there is a team 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.789
 which will help adapt as far as 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.340
 let's say this process has already gone but 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.880
 Sanka and we folded played still nalchike 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.790
 so yes and ruslana gin is pathetic well and 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.530
 so familiar with the guys so the problem 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.730
 communicating 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.730
 all the football players know each other
