00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.309
 good afternoon, let's see today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.510
 to work the smartphone meizu mx 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:23.119
 my guest is a quad version 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:28.670
 This unit 60 is four with three 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.670
 gigabytes of internal flash memory 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.450
 This video is full 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 review is only an opportunity for me 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.290
 show you this unit as far as it is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.450
 is fast 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:53.780
 or maybe the opposite is given 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.780
 really quite fast smartphone 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.620
 he is a pair of his rigidity to his 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.900
 power 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.060
 let's compare it to galaxy s3 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.060
 unknown flagship from samsung 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.550
 the parade is powerful but relatively 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 small screen he has 4 inch here 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.790
 let's curiosity around with him 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.810
 I'll put the device with a 5-inch screen 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.810
 feel the difference in size 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:48.000
 military stuffing as I mentioned 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:51.479
 about the same as he galaxy s3 in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.039
 The settings in the manor have a very interesting 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.350
 parameter called performance 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:06.390
 processor 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:13.560
 now I left her low and now go 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:19.010
 count pi number a million characters after 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.010
 a comma to some slow algorithm 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.939
 one full six tenths of a second 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.549
 return to the settings set high 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.549
 performance 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.620
 count pi again 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:52.280
 835 milliseconds almost double 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:56.780
 faster but in real life I am constantly 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.590
 walked with high performance in 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.819
 principle to me 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.220
 The battery charge was quite enough, we did not 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:09.560
 there was a need to slow down 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.310
 the processor we are for is very interesting 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.049
 feature 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.329
 he can record phone conversations 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.500
 does it well and appropriate 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:34.760
 software him 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:47.049
 preinstalled let's try two times 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:47.049
 three 4 5 when we called voice recorder 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.340
 as you noticed it was heard and me and well 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.099
 let's say we are his interlocutor ado.net 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.140
 speakerphone 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.910
 interlocutor's voice is more 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.910
 pleasant and not so sonorous 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.350
 farther 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.720
 couple of words about camera camera here 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.940
 8 megapixel but can't say that 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.940
 he is on me she is very impressed me 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.530
 here's a flash nice she is very good 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.889
 can work as a flashlight 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.889
 brightly 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:04.000
 view video as the unit is powerful 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.280
 no problem with the video is not possible 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.510
 watch even full hd 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:17.169
 if you need it for some reason very much 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:24.220
 pleased the built-in video player he 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:27.090
 turned out to be quite axis 1 let's run 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.090
 full hd video 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.780
 finally traditionally let's play 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.780
 a couple of toys 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.030
 but 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.370
 that's all I wanted for you today 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.370
 to show 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.920
