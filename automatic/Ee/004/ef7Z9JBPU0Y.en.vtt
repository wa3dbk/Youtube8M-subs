00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 hi today we are testing burgundy 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.899
 horse axes is a burgund unit 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.840
 which was added in the first gone and for 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.120
 body it has over seven hundred and twenty five 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 coins which distinguishes high 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 punching armor we test it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.910
 we will be against the German riders 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.590
 German cavalry which 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.810
 present in many Germanic factions 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.660
 for 625 coins per 100 coins 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.279
 cheaper and this is a great unit one of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 most effective for your money and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.750
 In general, in principle, this is one of the most 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 efficient investment of money German 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 Sannikov is an excellent indicator 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.809
 health attack against cavalry 20 units 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.280
 and high armor meaning they are all over the place 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.800
 Used is Judith which you 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 meeting me was interesting 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 can burgundy horse ax nicks 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.550
 given that they have melee damage 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 half i.e. 16 units go through 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 armor 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.640
 plus they are more expensive for them let's compare 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.180
 characteristics here 48 melee 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.210
 here 70 higher damage 32 32 but burgundy 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 more punching onslaught 10 by 48 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.369
 lose defense 43 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.710
 by 20 wins armor 42 by 53 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:14.299
 lose health 215 to 247 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.830
 lose morale higher and speed 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.330
 also higher than the bargonists in general 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 You can say the characteristics are higher 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.060
 lose more than just charger but they 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.689
 no voice against cavalry but in this 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 video we test 8 squads four 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.150
 combat situations of two units for each 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.720
 normal attack in a normal rhombus attack 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 usual rhombus on rhombus and usual rhombus 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.670
 but believe me having changed the mirror 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.840
 let's see can 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.240
 burgundy icons are greenhouses can 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.070
 they are not looking at the fact that they are one hundred coins 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.479
 more expensive and their characteristics are higher 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.299
 stand against with super effective 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.460
 German garden in which none 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.350
 less there are hidden bonuses such as 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.969
 attack against anyone in 20 units as well 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 burgundy horse ax nicks will 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.600
 use the ability frenzy which 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.119
 gives them a plus 10 melee 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.000
 that is, their superior superior to their neighbor 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.599
 Combat with almost double 80 against 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.599
 48 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.189
 as we see the German garden very 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.049
 steadfastly holds charge 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.019
 and there are 60 people left enough 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:24.079
 long time in a normal situation if 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.530
 do they go in a diamond they keep it charge 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.299
 even better almost all the time 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.659
 about the belkin from the composition of it do not live 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.680
 losing no one diamond on rum situation 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.829
 more neutral 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.280
 the battle goes very smoothly and where the robe came in 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:44.590
 Burgundians, too, we see that they are very 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.590
 evenly gradually but lose 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.370
 look at it until the end but I tell you 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.489
 a little bit of it already going through all 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.750
 situations in absolutely all Germanic 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.069
 riders are won 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.540
 that is, despite the fact that they are cheaper 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.310
 despite the fact that they have a number 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.500
 characteristics below is all but 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.790
 super efficient unit which due to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.239
 your bonus against cavalry 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.060
 wins and new deals burgundy 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.069
 horse greenhouses in battle against cavalry 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.469
 did not seem very good to me 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.629
 This Judit which will be more effective 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:19.150
 to attack infantry it must be in 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:21.650
 couple to lead with someone for example super 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.209
 super cool lansk cavalry who 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.010
 have burgundov in this dlc 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.260
 the exact name I do not remember there for 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.989
 my royal warriors with darts or 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.549
 what is it that they can stand against 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.040
 all enemy cavalry practically 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.629
 against except so math and a burgundy 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.120
 horse axes will be designed 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.370
 to destroy the infantry on this from me 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.109
