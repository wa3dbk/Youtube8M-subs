00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
going to try to pull her off balance a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.789 
going to try to pull her off balance a
little<00:01:33.450> bit<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.140> she's<00:01:34.350> definitely<00:01:34.530> gonna

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
little bit so she's definitely gonna

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.160 
little bit so she's definitely gonna
work<00:01:34.950> those<00:01:35.159> quads<00:01:35.310> everything

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
work those quads everything

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.440 
work those quads everything
more<00:01:36.619> but<00:01:37.250> just<00:01:37.460> kind<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.820> really<00:01:38.420> just

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
more but just kind of really just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.780 
more but just kind of really just
slightly<00:01:39.049> tug<00:01:39.439> to<00:01:39.710> pull<00:01:39.920> her<00:01:40.009> off<00:01:40.040> balance<00:01:40.580> so

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
slightly tug to pull her off balance so

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.789 
slightly tug to pull her off balance so
I'll<00:01:41.180> do<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.390> for<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.630> period<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.930> time<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
I'll do that for a period of time and

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.950 
I'll do that for a period of time and
during<00:01:43.009> that<00:01:43.189> 30<00:01:43.400> seconds<00:01:43.820> I'm<00:01:43.939> crossover<00:01:44.540> and

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
during that 30 seconds I'm crossover and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.480 
during that 30 seconds I'm crossover and
those<00:01:45.049> are<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.259> exact<00:01:45.560> same<00:01:45.770> thing<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.280> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
those are the exact same thing so the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.710 
those are the exact same thing so the
main<00:01:46.640> thing<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:46.880> I'm<00:01:47.060> going<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.210> be<00:01:47.450> that

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
main thing is I'm going to be that

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.590 
main thing is I'm going to be that
further<00:01:47.930> tuck<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:49.100> deep<00:01:49.460> Google+<00:01:50.299> journey

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
we're just going to just kind of work

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.719 
we're just going to just kind of work
within<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.850> man<00:01:53.060> okay<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:55.460> next<00:01:55.670> thing

crate<00:01:55.970> view<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.360> great<00:01:56.780> core<00:01:57.110> exercise<00:01:57.140> it's

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
crate view is a great core exercise it's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.980 
crate view is a great core exercise it's
pretty<00:01:58.759> difficult<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.240> do<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.450> make<00:01:59.720> sure<00:01:59.750> you

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
pretty difficult to do so make sure you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.550 
pretty difficult to do so make sure you
try<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:00.229> one<00:02:00.500> out<00:02:00.560> first<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:02.289> Swiss<00:02:03.289> ball

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
try this one out first it's a Swiss ball

so<00:02:07.189> we're<00:02:07.310> get<00:02:07.490> just<00:02:07.729> been<00:02:07.939> basically<00:02:08.660> the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so we're get just been basically the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.080 
so we're get just been basically the
front<00:02:08.989> leg<00:02:09.289> position<00:02:09.830> she's<00:02:10.310> gonna<00:02:10.429> be<00:02:10.610> same

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
front leg position she's gonna be same

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.550 
front leg position she's gonna be same
position<00:02:11.630> she<00:02:11.810> would<00:02:11.870> normally<00:02:12.050> be<00:02:12.380> on<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
position she would normally be on the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.320 
position she would normally be on the
ground<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.160> only<00:02:13.220> difference<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.790> she<00:02:13.819> now

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
ground the only difference is she now

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.780 
ground the only difference is she now
has<00:02:14.540> her<00:02:14.690> back<00:02:15.319> feet<00:02:15.560> elevated<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.519> I'm<00:02:16.640> gonna

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
has her back feet elevated and I'm gonna

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.300

go<00:02:16.940> 30<00:02:17.209> 30<00:02:17.299> low<00:02:17.750> on<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:18.200> make<00:02:18.769> sure<00:02:18.950> she's<00:02:19.130> got

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
go 30 30 low on here make sure she's got

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.130 
go 30 30 low on here make sure she's got
good<00:02:19.489> form<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.940> once<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.360> turn<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.750> machine<00:02:20.989> on

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
good form and once I turn the machine on

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.920 
good form and once I turn the machine on
she<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.799> going<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.370> do<00:02:22.580> some<00:02:23.360> slow<00:02:23.720> methodical

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
a little pre activation we double core

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.860 
a little pre activation we double core
now<00:03:25.790> we're<00:03:26.000> going<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> go<00:03:26.299> into<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.660> couple

to thirty thirty high in this room
a little<00:03:39.450> bit<00:03:39.569> more<00:03:39.719> intensity<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.069> we're

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:41.219 
a little bit more intensity so we're

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.709 
a little bit more intensity so we're
gonna<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.519> her<00:03:41.640> jessica's<00:03:42.120> make<00:03:42.299> sure<00:03:42.510> she's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
in a right angle in the front key right

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.459 
in a right angle in the front key right
angle<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.000> back<00:03:45.180> knee<00:03:45.420> but<00:03:46.019> she<00:03:46.140> did<00:03:46.319> stay

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:46.469 
angle in the back knee but she did stay

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:47.990 
angle in the back knee but she did stay
upright<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.040> then<00:03:47.189> once<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.430> turned<00:03:47.670> machine

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
upright and then once I turned machine

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.250 
upright and then once I turned machine
on<00:03:48.239> she's<00:03:48.930> gonna<00:03:49.109> drop<00:03:49.349> up<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.890> down<00:03:51.260> so

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
on she's gonna drop up and down so

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.259 
on she's gonna drop up and down so
progression<00:03:52.980> could<00:03:53.219> be<00:03:53.370> she<00:03:53.549> put<00:03:53.819> her<00:03:53.879> arms<00:03:54.150> in

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
progression could be she put her arms in

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.619 
progression could be she put her arms in
front<00:03:54.480> their<00:03:55.230> arms<00:03:55.500> overhead<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:56.450> can<00:03:57.450> do

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
front their arms overhead I can do

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.539 
front their arms overhead I can do
anything<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:58.739> challenge<00:03:59.159> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
anything to to really challenge the

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.250 
anything to to really challenge the
execution<00:04:00.329> before<00:04:00.689> I<00:04:00.719> add<00:04:00.900> any<00:04:01.079> more

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
execution before I add any more

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.599 
execution before I add any more
intensity<00:04:01.709> all<00:04:02.250> right

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
intensity all right

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.190 
intensity all right
so<00:04:02.939> we'll<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.120> 30<00:04:03.389> seconds<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.989> then<00:04:04.079> we'll

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
so we'll do 30 seconds and then we'll

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.819 
so we'll do 30 seconds and then we'll
switch<00:04:04.439> sides<00:04:04.790> okay<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.480> then<00:04:06.659> finally<00:04:07.109> this

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
switch sides okay and then finally this

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.559 
switch sides okay and then finally this
is<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:08.040> unique<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.579> just<00:04:08.849> because<00:04:08.969> of<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.299> snow

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
is a unique one just because of the snow

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.869 
is a unique one just because of the snow
boot<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.049> really<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:11.129> those<00:04:11.250> who<00:04:11.400> skied<00:04:11.669> you

know the tight calves and Achilles so

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.479 
know the tight calves and Achilles so
this<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.400> squat<00:04:14.879> to<00:04:15.359> reference<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:16.889> we're

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
this is a squat to reference so we're

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.890 
this is a squat to reference so we're
gonna<00:04:17.579> set<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.000> same<00:04:18.209> setting<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:18.780> it's

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
gonna set the same setting so it's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.150 
gonna set the same setting so it's
thirty<00:04:19.310> thirty<00:04:20.310> low<00:04:20.930> 30<00:04:21.930> Hertz<00:04:22.199> 30<00:04:22.770> seconds

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
thirty thirty low 30 Hertz 30 seconds

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.860 
thirty thirty low 30 Hertz 30 seconds
time<00:04:23.310> high<00:04:23.550> amplitude<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.330> we<00:04:24.449> keep<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.720> same

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
time high amplitude so we keep the same

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.080 
time high amplitude so we keep the same
setting<00:04:25.289> as<00:04:25.770> we<00:04:25.979> did<00:04:26.130> for<00:04:26.340> these<00:04:26.550> split<00:04:26.820> squat

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
setting as we did for these split squat

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.290 
setting as we did for these split squat
so<00:04:27.720> Jessica's<00:04:28.139> gonna<00:04:28.320> get<00:04:28.620> down<00:04:28.830> into<00:04:29.039> a<00:04:29.099> squat

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300

so Jessica's gonna get down into a squat
we're<00:04:30.300> gonna<00:04:30.389> turn<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.780> machine<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.440> she

about<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.470> stability<00:04:47.070> we're<00:04:47.250> focusing<00:04:47.639> on

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
about the stability we're focusing on

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.149 
about the stability we're focusing on
it's<00:04:48.180> really<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.720> squat<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.409> the<00:04:49.530> cap<00:04:49.740> reason

it's really the squat to the cap reason
to<00:04:50.310> really<00:04:50.550> extend<00:04:50.970> them<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:51.900> those<00:04:52.080> are<00:04:52.260> some

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
to really extend them so those are some

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.800 
to really extend them so those are some
really<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:52.949> pre<00:04:53.610> activation<00:04:54.210> from<00:04:54.479> whatever<00:04:54.630> a

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
really a pre activation from whatever a

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.409 
really a pre activation from whatever a
couple<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.409> core<00:04:55.770> great<00:04:56.039> core<00:04:56.250> exercises<00:04:56.729> and
