hi I'm lassi and I'm teaching people in
metal<00:00:06.460> shaping<00:00:06.940> and<00:00:07.359> I<00:00:07.960> have<00:00:08.170> done<00:00:08.320> that<00:00:08.500> for

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
metal shaping and I have done that for

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.799 
metal shaping and I have done that for
many<00:00:08.800> years<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:09.370> we<00:00:09.490> are<00:00:09.610> back<00:00:10.059> here<00:00:10.330> again<00:00:10.630> on

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
many years and we are back here again on

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.539 
many years and we are back here again on
YouTube<00:00:11.049> with<00:00:11.500> some<00:00:11.650> more<00:00:11.860> tips<00:00:11.889> and<00:00:12.340> tricks

on<00:00:12.789> this<00:00:13.600> little<00:00:14.160> video<00:00:15.840> clip<00:00:16.840> I'm<00:00:17.619> going<00:00:17.680> to

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
on this little video clip I'm going to

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.310 
on this little video clip I'm going to
show<00:00:18.580> you<00:00:19.150> a<00:00:19.270> little<00:00:19.480> more<00:00:19.630> what<00:00:19.840> we<00:00:19.990> can<00:00:20.170> do

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
show you a little more what we can do

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.839 
show you a little more what we can do
with<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:20.619> second-generation<00:00:21.099> bead<00:00:21.640> roller

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
with the second-generation bead roller

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.230 
with the second-generation bead roller
that<00:00:22.240> I<00:00:22.269> came<00:00:22.449> up<00:00:22.810> with<00:00:23.310> probably<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.640> year<00:00:25.000> ago

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
that I came up with probably a year ago

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.419 
that I came up with probably a year ago
or<00:00:25.269> something<00:00:25.720> like<00:00:25.869> that<00:00:26.320> now<00:00:26.529> and<00:00:26.769> we<00:00:27.220> have

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
or something like that now and we have

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.060 
or something like that now and we have
worked<00:00:28.150> on<00:00:28.330> it<00:00:28.539> then<00:00:28.810> we<00:00:29.080> have<00:00:29.230> changed<00:00:29.830> things

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
worked on it then we have changed things

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.220 
worked on it then we have changed things
and<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:30.640> now<00:00:31.240> we<00:00:31.300> are<00:00:31.539> finally<00:00:32.020> we're

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
and and now we are finally we're

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.740 
and and now we are finally we're
producing<00:00:33.190> it<00:00:34.650> so<00:00:35.650> in<00:00:36.240> the<00:00:37.240> second-generation

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
producing it so in the second-generation

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.770 
producing it so in the second-generation
bead<00:00:38.350> roller<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:39.580> shaft<00:00:39.850> here<00:00:40.210> drops<00:00:40.510> down

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
bead roller the shaft here drops down

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.200 
bead roller the shaft here drops down
and<00:00:41.140> it's<00:00:41.800> go<00:00:42.010> over<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.370> size<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.090> then<00:00:43.180> I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
and it's go over to that size and then I

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.150 
and it's go over to that size and then I
have<00:00:43.420> gears<00:00:43.780> there<00:00:44.020> so<00:00:44.170> both<00:00:44.410> shafts<00:00:44.860> are

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
have gears there so both shafts are

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.280 
have gears there so both shafts are
driven<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:47.200> have<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.460> third<00:00:49.120> axle<00:00:49.990> coming

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
driven and I have this third axle coming

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.650 
driven and I have this third axle coming
up<00:00:50.440> here<00:00:50.830> and<00:00:51.010> I<00:00:51.580> can<00:00:51.820> put<00:00:51.850> any<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.540> other

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
up here and I can put any of the other

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.140 
up here and I can put any of the other
dies<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.320> top<00:00:53.590> here<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.220> can<00:00:54.460> have<00:00:54.610> support

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
dies on top here so I can have support

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.080 
dies on top here so I can have support
on<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.450> outside<00:00:55.900> if<00:00:56.590> I<00:00:56.920> need<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:57.640> the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
on the outside if I need to and the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.820 
on the outside if I need to and the
reason<00:00:58.420> why<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.540> came<00:00:58.810> up<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.320> is<00:00:59.560> that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
reason why I came up with this is that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.030 
reason why I came up with this is that
through<00:01:00.700> the<00:01:00.850> years<00:01:01.090> of<00:01:01.300> teaching<00:01:01.510> I<00:01:02.040> have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
through the years of teaching I have

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.460 
through the years of teaching I have
seen<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:03.460> we<00:01:03.670> had<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.850> demand<00:01:04.119> sometimes<00:01:05.110> a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
seen that we had a demand sometimes a

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.910 
seen that we had a demand sometimes a
few<00:01:05.710> times<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.640> we<00:01:07.240> need<00:01:07.510> some<00:01:08.050> support<00:01:08.560> on

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
few times that we need some support on

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.860 
few times that we need some support on
the<00:01:09.010> outside<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.150> that's<00:01:10.330> why<00:01:10.510> we<00:01:10.660> came<00:01:10.810> up

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
the outside so that's why we came up

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.060 
the outside so that's why we came up
with<00:01:11.170> this<00:01:11.350> I<00:01:11.590> can<00:01:12.400> change<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:13.030> angle<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.660> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
with this I can change the angle here so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.780 
with this I can change the angle here so
I<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.480> change<00:01:16.480> that<00:01:16.780> easy<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.470> I<00:01:18.070> can<00:01:18.340> adjust

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
I can change that easy and I can adjust

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.510 
I can change that easy and I can adjust
this<00:01:19.270> up<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.840> down<00:01:20.050> as<00:01:20.440> well<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:23.190> then<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.220> can

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
this up and down as well and then I can

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.300 
this up and down as well and then I can
adjust<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:25.090> in<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.690> out<00:01:25.810> here<00:01:26.440> too<00:01:26.740> so

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
adjust this in and out here too so

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.580 
adjust this in and out here too so
that's<00:01:27.490> why<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.700> have<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.210> extension<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:29.050> here

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
that's why I have this extension on here

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.410 
that's why I have this extension on here
and<00:01:29.770> on<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.430> video<00:01:31.120> later<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.880> what<00:01:34.120> I'm<00:01:34.240> going

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
and on the video later so what I'm going

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.950 
and on the video later so what I'm going
to<00:01:34.510> do<00:01:34.750> here<00:01:35.020> now<00:01:35.229> I'm<00:01:35.650> going<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.220> open<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.729> up

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
to do here now I'm going to open this up

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.870 
to do here now I'm going to open this up
hold<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:38.470> it's<00:01:38.590> it's<00:01:38.890> parallel<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
hold this so it's it's parallel to the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.360 
hold this so it's it's parallel to the
guide<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.600> then<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.470> adjust<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.729> M<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.960> it

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
guide and then I adjust this M so it

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.830 
guide and then I adjust this M so it
touching<00:01:45.370> there<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:45.909> I<00:01:45.940> have<00:01:46.150> support<00:01:46.600> there

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
touching there so I have support there

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.200 
touching there so I have support there
then<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:48.040> can<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:50.430> turn<00:01:51.430> this<00:01:51.640> either<00:01:51.970> up

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
then I can I can I turn this either up

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.230 
then I can I can I turn this either up
or<00:01:52.450> down<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.680> can<00:01:53.950> keep<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.610> piece<00:01:54.940> in

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
or down so I can keep that piece in

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.719 
or down so I can keep that piece in
level<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.560> run<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.010> bead

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.700 

sometimes<00:02:04.729> if<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.510> only<00:02:05.720> have<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.200> guide<00:02:06.409> it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
sometimes if you only have the guide it

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.160 
sometimes if you only have the guide it
can<00:02:06.979> be<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.190> little<00:02:07.460> difficult<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.270> run<00:02:09.140> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
can be a little difficult to run a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.800 
can be a little difficult to run a
straight<00:02:09.560> line<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.729> as<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.360> see<00:02:11.569> now

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
straight line but as you can see now

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.990 
straight line but as you can see now
because<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:12.980> support<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> outside

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
because I have support on the outside

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.980 
because I have support on the outside
here<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.450> goes<00:02:15.140> straight<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.860> guide
