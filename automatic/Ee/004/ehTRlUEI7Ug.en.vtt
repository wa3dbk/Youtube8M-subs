I want to put an image out in this
background<00:00:14.160> area<00:00:14.870> so<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> go<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> your

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
background area so to do that go to your

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.470 
background area so to do that go to your
shader<00:00:19.010> go<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> your<00:00:20.279> world<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.359> always

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
shader go to your world and I always

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.269 
shader go to your world and I always
like<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:22.050> start<00:00:22.289> off<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> blend<00:00:23.840> and

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
like to just start off with a blend and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.730 
like to just start off with a blend and
then<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:27.359> little<00:00:27.750> leopard<00:00:28.320> icon

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
then go to your little leopard icon

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.889 
then go to your little leopard icon
texture<00:00:29.480> with<00:00:30.480> Avenue<00:00:32.000> go<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> none<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
texture with Avenue go to none and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
texture with Avenue go to none and
change<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> image<00:00:35.450> go<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.480> load<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.530> then

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
change it to image go to load and then

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.619 
change it to image go to load and then
hopefully<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.090> textures<00:00:39.480> folder

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
hopefully have a textures folder

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.750 
hopefully have a textures folder
somewhere<00:00:39.960> i'm<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.620> grab<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.219> sky

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
somewhere i'm going to grab a sky

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.880 
somewhere i'm going to grab a sky
picture<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.360> my<00:00:42.480> textures<00:00:43.129> go<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.750> nature

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
picture for my textures go into nature

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.240 
picture for my textures go into nature
the<00:00:46.890> sky<00:00:47.870> i'll<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.110> pick<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.559> these<00:00:49.739> random

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the sky i'll just pick one these random

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
the sky i'll just pick one these random
skies<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.739> select<00:00:52.739> image<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.449> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
skies on here select image and that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560 
skies on here select image and that
should<00:00:55.199> put<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.949> background<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
should put it on my background I do I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
should put it on my background I do I
need<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.170> thing<00:00:58.500> before<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.859> do

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
need to do one more thing before I do

need to do one more thing before I do
that<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.430> back<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.850> little<00:01:00.170> world

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

that so go back to your little world
button<00:01:02.030> go<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> map<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.979> n<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:06.320> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
button go to it to map to use n up and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.890 
button go to it to map to use n up and
then<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.159> place<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.479> for

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
then that will place that in there for

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
then that will place that in there for
you<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.590> shift<00:01:10.890> p<00:01:13.909> just<00:01:14.909> click<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> drag

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you if I do shift p just click and drag

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
you if I do shift p just click and drag
to<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.299> play<00:01:19.520> ok

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to kind of see that actually in play ok

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.510 
to kind of see that actually in play ok
that<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.759> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> basic<00:01:22.040> sky<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.430> if

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that was kind of a basic sky there so if

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
that was kind of a basic sky there so if
i<00:01:23.580> decide<00:01:23.820> i<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.380> get

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
i decide i don't like that one to get

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.550 
i decide i don't like that one to get
rid<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.720> then<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:27.960> i<00:01:27.990> need<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.409> go

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
back over here to my texture and come

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.410 
back over here to my texture and come
over<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.970> area<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.869> take<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> off

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
go to load and reload up that texture

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.980 
go to load and reload up that texture
that<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.979> I'll<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:41.990> my

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

that I have so I'll go back into my
nature<00:01:43.229> area<00:01:43.640> sky<00:01:45.020> look<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> different<00:01:46.680> one

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
nature area sky look at a different one

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
nature area sky look at a different one
that<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.159> fleas<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:47.820> better<00:01:48.439> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that will fleas a little bit better that

one works a little bit better come over
to<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:54.119> world<00:01:54.420> icon<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.520> make<00:01:56.520> sure<00:01:56.670> i<00:01:56.700> have

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
to my world icon and make sure i have

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.260 
to my world icon and make sure i have
those<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:59.270> horizontal

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270

those up it was then up the horizontal
and<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> plans<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> shift<00:02:02.399> p<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.750> check

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and then the plans do a shift p to check

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.770 
and then the plans do a shift p to check
that<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.700> see<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.060> looks

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.300 

and<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.840> wanted<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.230> play<00:02:12.409> some<00:02:12.739> lighting<00:02:13.040> on
