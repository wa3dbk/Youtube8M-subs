00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 so it's vital that we liked it 

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.379
 enter the game watching a game of 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.720
 champions or the tradition has to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.420
 leave then beat it 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.400
 they are not new no matter how easy 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.920
 have the line that we risk 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.030
 it is vital that in m3 and that budget of 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.610
 month and possibly continue we liked 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.530
 in transit moving the ball of a 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.120
 fast way but for others to like you 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.250
 he thinks that you want us 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.780
 we have three minutes the teams finish 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.940
 paying six minutes and it's a way 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.410
 worn out I would prefer it to be more 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.720
 direct and who have more chances to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.640
 principle and I think that especially the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.350
 first part we missed ketchup 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.330
 the intel circuit simplified area 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.370
 in a bed and will be used audience with 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.890
 the calculator for you was in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 get the first goal which is that if not 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.190
 the division from if it would be easier 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.710
 because toxic blacksmith and always 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.840
 such a creative team hold watch 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.500
 tells the press conference that his coach 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.899
 I work back so it's easy 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.170
 in the end I know that it is vital 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.940
 he has to risk a great rhythm because 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.340
 just as the yokes tradition passed very 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.840
 powerful and fast to 102 and effective of 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:20.130
 I refresh three defenses but 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 if lost point 3 is important 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.350
 15 point infection 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 at the beginning I do not feel in compression 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.869
 and in that the publication is to say I gave 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.299
 the presentation the turn to edit 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.539
 I knew about the difficulty I had here 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 so that you put in another life to 0 and a 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:43.950
 number in both trading but also 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.260
 in medical and psychologically this is not 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.980
 I would be here but I sing what I'm going to 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.720
 have some extra good pressure 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.150
 yes I know there has been a bit of debate 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.250
 with this topic but at the end it takes the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.030
 decisions are me and I think it's better 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.030
 for the team 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.620
 the first one that I think has more 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.970
 experience and at the time we said 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.310
 that we bring to you to play central- 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.810
 not only to play pivot for me from 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.220
 playing pivot would not have come to have 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.290
 a player too good in front as 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.610
 sergio Busquets that to play three 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.950
 or four five parties a year do not 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.600
 we would not have brought it and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.130
 I think the two ways for it to 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.840
 adapt better or faster what 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.400
 need is to play because all the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.990
 defensive concepts that we can say 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.940
 the small failures that you can have from 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.030
 adjust to adjust the only way that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.500
 has to do it is playing and I think that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.780
 is what I have to do 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 as you can put it in the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.270
 maximum possible minutes for it to be 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.270
 adapt fast
