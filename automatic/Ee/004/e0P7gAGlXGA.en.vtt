this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.480> a<00:00:00.870> sector<00:00:01.350> 9<00:00:01.560> ala<00:00:01.979> moana<00:00:02.570> with<00:00:03.950> stock

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
this is a sector 9 ala moana with stock

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.379 
this is a sector 9 ala moana with stock
wheels<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.759> they<00:00:06.540> change<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.930> berries<00:00:07.500> to

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
wheels and they change the berries to

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.030 
wheels and they change the berries to
Boeing<00:00:09.389> threads<00:00:09.679> even<00:00:10.679> though<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.889> doesn't

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
Boeing threads even though it doesn't

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.830 
Boeing threads even though it doesn't
make<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> difference<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.240> good<00:00:12.420> carving

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
make a difference it's a good carving

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.279 
make a difference it's a good carving
board<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.980> has<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:15.049> Sidewinder<00:00:16.049> trucks

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
board it has a going Sidewinder trucks

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.279 
board it has a going Sidewinder trucks
so<00:00:17.039> they're<00:00:17.220> really<00:00:17.369> turning<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.960> want<00:00:19.230> to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so they're really turning if you want to

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.660 
so they're really turning if you want to
get<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> check<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.250> isn't<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
get a check for this really isn't it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
get a check for this really isn't it
because<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:22.289> mainly<00:00:22.560> for

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because this is just it's mainly for

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
because this is just it's mainly for
carving<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:24.869> commuting<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.599> there's<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
carving and commuting and there's the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
carving and commuting and there's the
thing<00:00:28.650> about<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.949> board<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:30.199> there's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
thing about this board is that there's

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.470 
thing about this board is that there's
no<00:00:31.380> tail<00:00:32.059> at<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> can't<00:00:35.399> pop<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.690> or

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
no tail at all so you can't pop it up or

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
no tail at all so you can't pop it up or
anything<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.719> could<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
anything you could do you do one of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.529 
anything you could do you do one of
these<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.489> it's<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:45.149> probably<00:00:45.270> not

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
these but the it's it's probably not

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.049 
these but the it's it's probably not
safe<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.730> when<00:00:47.730> you're<00:00:47.910> moving

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
safe to do that when you're moving

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.319 
safe to do that when you're moving
because<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> way<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.190> board<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.460> set<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
because the way this board is set up the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
because the way this board is set up the
Sidewinder<00:00:51.870> truck<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> make<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.680> high

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Sidewinder truck to make it really high

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.979 
Sidewinder truck to make it really high
so<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.590> stable<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.570> ever<00:00:57.719> try

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so it's not as stable and don't ever try

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.910 
so it's not as stable and don't ever try
to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.609> downhill<00:00:59.809> with<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.960> board<00:01:01.260> because

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to go downhill with this board because

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.000 
to go downhill with this board because
you<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.460> speed<00:01:02.820> wobble<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> comes

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you will get speed wobble and it comes

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
you will get speed wobble and it comes
with<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.510> really<00:01:06.510> high<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.170> quarter<00:01:07.710> inch<00:01:08.600> or<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
with a really high a quarter inch or a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
with a really high a quarter inch or a
half<00:01:09.720> inch<00:01:10.080> comes<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> half<00:01:11.280> inch<00:01:11.400> risers

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
half inch comes with a half inch risers

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.980 
half inch comes with a half inch risers
and<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.619> no<00:01:13.860> wheel<00:01:14.100> bite<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.780> bought

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and you get no wheel bite if you bought

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
and you get no wheel bite if you bought
this<00:01:16.200> board<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.400> wanted<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.030> think

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
this board and you wanted to you think

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.609 
this board and you wanted to you think
you're<00:01:18.600> thinking<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.960> making<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.470> bit

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you're thinking of making a little bit

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.490 
you're thinking of making a little bit
lower<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.570> suggest<00:01:21.750> taking<00:01:22.229> off<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
lower and I don't suggest taking off the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.810 
lower and I don't suggest taking off the
riders<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> might<00:01:23.189> crack<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.580> board

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
riders can you might crack your board

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.350 
riders can you might crack your board
but<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.290> could<00:01:25.470> make<00:01:25.710> I've<00:01:26.640> done<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
but you could make I've done this and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
but you could make I've done this and
you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.659> take<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.530> middle<00:01:28.890> thing<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you can take out this middle thing of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.830 
you can take out this middle thing of
the<00:01:29.520> Sidewinder<00:01:29.970> truck<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.170> could<00:01:32.840> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the Sidewinder truck and you could you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.060 
the Sidewinder truck and you could you
take<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.530> put<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
take it out and they just put it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480 
take it out and they just put it
regularly<00:01:35.689> but<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:38.280> will

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
regularly but if you do do that you will

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.940 
regularly but if you do do that you will
get<00:01:38.640> wheels<00:01:38.939> lines<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.780> suggest<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.229> keep

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
get wheels lines so I suggest you keep

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.450 
get wheels lines so I suggest you keep
it<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.189> double<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.270> high<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.750> like

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
it a double it's really high it's like

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.789 
it a double it's really high it's like
yeah<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:44.479> bet<00:01:44.630> double<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.380> if<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.590> want<00:01:45.740> to

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
yeah you bet double and if you want to

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.140 
yeah you bet double and if you want to
get<00:01:45.890> tricked<00:01:46.100> Lord<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.909> tricks

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
get tricked Lord is one of the tricks

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.500 
get tricked Lord is one of the tricks
that<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.869> suggest<00:01:48.229> getting<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.680> different<00:01:48.830> board

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
that I suggest getting a different board

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.270 
that I suggest getting a different board
it's<00:01:50.510> alright<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:50.810> slides<00:01:51.170> it's<00:01:51.619> really

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's alright for slides it's really

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.710 
it's alright for slides it's really
turning<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:52.760> I<00:01:52.790> don't<00:01:53.119> know<00:01:53.210> how<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.420> is

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
turning so I don't know how that is

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.640 
turning so I don't know how that is
for<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:54.820> I've<00:01:55.820> written<00:01:56.200> busting<00:01:57.200> my<00:01:57.380> show

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
for that I've written busting my show

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.249 
for that I've written busting my show
board<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:59.060> was<00:01:59.180> easier<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.840> do<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> slide<00:02:00.229> on

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
board and it was easier to do a slide on

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.810 
board and it was easier to do a slide on
that<00:02:00.380> board<00:02:00.710> because<00:02:01.250> there's<00:02:01.400> lower<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.729> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
that board because there's lower to the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.850 
that board because there's lower to the
ground<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.270> go<00:02:02.780> chucks<00:02:03.080> for<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:03.470> as<00:02:03.590> turning

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
ground and go chucks for it as turning

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.609 
ground and go chucks for it as turning
of<00:02:04.009> these<00:02:04.869> slides<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:06.409> made<00:02:06.619> my<00:02:06.770> own<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:08.410> went<00:02:09.410> to

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
of these slides I made my own I went to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.620 
of these slides I made my own I went to
Home<00:02:10.160> Depot<00:02:10.190> got<00:02:11.120> these<00:02:11.840> gloves<00:02:12.170> leather<00:02:13.010> and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
Home Depot got these gloves leather and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.190 
Home Depot got these gloves leather and
I<00:02:14.630> got<00:02:15.190> Korean<00:02:16.190> samples<00:02:17.200> industrial-strength

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
I got Korean samples industrial-strength

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.240 
I got Korean samples industrial-strength
velcro<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.070> put<00:02:19.790> them<00:02:19.940> on<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:22.160> good

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
velcro and put them on and the good

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.470 
velcro and put them on and the good
thing<00:02:22.370> about<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.910> if<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.120> can

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
thing about this is if you can

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.590 
thing about this is if you can
experiment<00:02:24.320> with<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.860> placement<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:26.540> you

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
experiment with the placement so you

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600 
experiment with the placement so you
could<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:27.170> try<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.739> out<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.340> can<00:02:28.459> move

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
could just try it out and you can move

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.060 
could just try it out and you can move
it<00:02:28.760> let<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.330> do<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.900> was<00:02:30.350> gonna<00:02:30.500> do<00:02:30.739> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
it let you do it I was gonna do the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.910 
it let you do it I was gonna do the
cutting<00:02:31.430> board<00:02:31.640> style<00:02:31.910> but<00:02:32.769> it's<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.830> little

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
cutting board style but it's a little

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.310 
cutting board style but it's a little
bit<00:02:34.070> harder<00:02:34.430> than<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.700> one<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.930> suggest

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
bit harder than this one and I suggest

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.650 
bit harder than this one and I suggest
getting<00:02:36.470> leather<00:02:36.739> gloves<00:02:37.070> because<00:02:37.660> cloth

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
getting leather gloves because cloth

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.410 
getting leather gloves because cloth
gloves<00:02:38.870> will<00:02:39.650> rip<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.180> get<00:02:41.330> to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
gloves will rip and then you just get to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.240 
gloves will rip and then you just get to
end<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.690> by<00:02:41.840> another<00:02:42.110> one<00:02:42.319> these<00:02:42.890> are<00:02:42.920> actually

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
end up by another one these are actually

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.090 
end up by another one these are actually
cheaper<00:02:43.519> than<00:02:43.670> copper<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:45.050> suggest<00:02:45.830> doing

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
cheaper than copper so I suggest doing

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.039 
cheaper than copper so I suggest doing
it<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.400> way<00:02:46.459> unless<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.840> another

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
it this way unless you like it another

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.860 
it this way unless you like it another
way<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:48.350> this<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.709> really<00:02:48.920> good<00:02:49.040> way

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
way but this is a really good way

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.910 
way but this is a really good way
basically<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:51.110> look<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.650> same

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
basically they look the same

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.259 
basically they look the same
nothing<00:02:52.280> really<00:02:52.400> scratched<00:02:52.760> off<00:02:52.970> too<00:02:53.120> much

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
nothing really scratched off too much

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.090 
nothing really scratched off too much
and<00:02:53.660> I'm<00:02:54.200> pretty<00:02:54.380> sure<00:02:54.440> these<00:02:54.620> will<00:02:54.769> last<00:02:54.920> a

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
and I'm pretty sure these will last a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.740 
and I'm pretty sure these will last a
really<00:02:55.220> long<00:02:55.310> time<00:02:55.610> if<00:02:56.000> they<00:02:56.239> don't<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.570> just

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
really long time if they don't you just

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.120 
really long time if they don't you just
get<00:02:56.930> another<00:02:56.989> one<00:02:57.290> home<00:02:57.440> debug<00:02:58.120> alright
