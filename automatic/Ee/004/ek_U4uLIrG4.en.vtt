expert guys are still confused about
post-workout<00:00:05.460> drinks<00:00:05.940> they're<00:00:06.540> not<00:00:06.660> sure

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
post-workout drinks they're not sure

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.980 
post-workout drinks they're not sure
whether<00:00:07.109> they<00:00:07.290> need<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.710> protein<00:00:08.309> shake<00:00:08.610> or<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
whether they need a protein shake or a

whether they need a protein shake or a
carbohydrate<00:00:09.990> drink<00:00:10.320> let<00:00:11.130> me<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.580> can

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
carbohydrate drink let me see if I can

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.400 
carbohydrate drink let me see if I can
explain<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.719> because<00:00:12.960> there's<00:00:13.259> so

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
explain some of this because there's so

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.820 
explain some of this because there's so
much<00:00:13.559> myth<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.280> misinformation<00:00:14.880> about<00:00:15.540> it

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
much myth and misinformation about it

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.830 
much myth and misinformation about it

the only time you're going to need a

the only time you're going to need a
post-workout<00:00:18.840> drink<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:20.160> you're<00:00:20.460> training

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
post-workout drink is if you're training

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.050 
post-workout drink is if you're training

to need is a carbohydrate drink and
here's<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> reason<00:00:32.219> why<00:00:33.140> when<00:00:34.140> you're

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
here's the reason why when you're

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.930 
here's the reason why when you're
training<00:00:34.590> whether<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.100> weight<00:00:35.340> lifting<00:00:35.760> or

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
training whether it's weight lifting or

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.830 
training whether it's weight lifting or
cardio<00:00:36.260> your<00:00:37.260> body<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> using<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.160> glycogen

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
cardio your body is using up glycogen

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
cardio your body is using up glycogen
then<00:00:39.840> after<00:00:40.469> your<00:00:40.590> workout<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.280> body<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
then after your workout your body is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.270 
then after your workout your body is
struggling<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.629> replace<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.410> glycogen<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
struggling to replace that glycogen and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
struggling to replace that glycogen and
the<00:00:45.270> problem<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.870> training<00:00:46.200> day<00:00:46.559> after<00:00:46.890> day

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the problem with training day after day

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
the problem with training day after day
after<00:00:47.190> day<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:48.120> tremendous<00:00:48.600> intensity<00:00:49.440> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
after day with tremendous intensity is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.279 
after day with tremendous intensity is
that<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.520> body<00:00:50.730> never<00:00:51.030> recovers<00:00:51.539> fully<00:00:51.989> or

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that the body never recovers fully or

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
that the body never recovers fully or
completely<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.550> you're<00:00:53.730> always<00:00:53.879> running<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
completely so you're always running a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
completely so you're always running a
glycogen<00:00:54.960> deficit<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.010> might<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.550> bother<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
glycogen deficit it might not bother you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
glycogen deficit it might not bother you
this<00:00:57.329> week<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> could<00:00:58.590> bother<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
this week but it could bother you the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
this week but it could bother you the
following<00:00:59.699> week<00:00:59.879> we've<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.570> had<00:01:00.690> those<00:01:00.750> weeks

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
following week we've all had those weeks

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.930 
following week we've all had those weeks
where<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.410> feel<00:01:01.649> great<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.219> feel<00:01:02.370> incredible

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
where we feel great we feel incredible

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
where we feel great we feel incredible
and<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> next<00:01:03.719> week<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> feel<00:01:04.439> kind<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and then the next week we feel kind of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
and then the next week we feel kind of
punky<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> same

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
punky we just don't have the same

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
punky we just don't have the same
strength<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> same<00:01:06.810> snap<00:01:07.200> that's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
strength of the same snap that's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
strength of the same snap that's
typically<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.330> haven't<00:01:09.630> replaced

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
typically because you haven't replaced

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380 
typically because you haven't replaced
all<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> glycogen<00:01:10.939> when<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.090> done

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
all the glycogen when you're done

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
all the glycogen when you're done
working<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> two-hour<00:01:14.040> glycogen

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
working out you have a two-hour glycogen

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.020 
working out you have a two-hour glycogen
window<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.960> means<00:01:16.320> during<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.250> two<00:01:17.640> hours

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
window that means during that two hours

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.480 
window that means during that two hours
after<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.630> workout<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.860> muscles<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.430> much

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
after a workout the muscles are much

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.039 
after a workout the muscles are much
more<00:01:20.820> receptive<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.100> absorbing<00:01:23.100> glycogen

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
more receptive to absorbing glycogen

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
more receptive to absorbing glycogen
therefore<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> had<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.909> carbohydrate

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
therefore if you had a carbohydrate

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.600 
therefore if you had a carbohydrate
drink<00:01:27.270> two<00:01:27.869> hours<00:01:28.259> after<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.710> workout<00:01:29.130> your

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
drink two hours after your workout your

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.780 
drink two hours after your workout your
ability<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.180> replace<00:01:30.630> used<00:01:31.439> glycogen<00:01:32.009> happens

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
ability to replace used glycogen happens

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.260 
ability to replace used glycogen happens
much<00:01:33.090> faster<00:01:33.860> after<00:01:34.860> two<00:01:35.040> hours<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.909> really

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
much faster after two hours it really

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.719 
much faster after two hours it really
doesn't<00:01:36.570> make<00:01:36.630> much<00:01:36.810> difference<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.860> after<00:01:38.549> an

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
doesn't make much difference so after an

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.630 
doesn't make much difference so after an
intense<00:01:39.240> workout<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.079> again<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.890> talking

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
intense workout and again I'm talking

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.660 
intense workout and again I'm talking
about<00:01:41.700> hard<00:01:42.390> intense<00:01:43.079> training<00:01:43.590> day<00:01:44.280> after

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
about hard intense training day after

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
about hard intense training day after
day<00:01:44.880> after<00:01:45.060> day<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.570> most<00:01:45.720> important<00:01:46.229> thing

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
day after day the most important thing

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.770 
day after day the most important thing
is<00:01:46.619> some<00:01:47.070> type<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> carbohydrate<00:01:48.030> drink<00:01:48.329> like

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
is some type of carbohydrate drink like

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
is some type of carbohydrate drink like
let's<00:01:49.049> say<00:01:49.140> Gatorade<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.579> didn't<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
let's say Gatorade if I didn't have a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120 
let's say Gatorade if I didn't have a
Gatorade<00:01:51.390> I'd<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.840> three<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:52.619> four<00:01:52.799> ounces

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
Gatorade I'd have three or four ounces

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.170 
Gatorade I'd have three or four ounces
of<00:01:53.310> coke<00:01:53.549> yes<00:01:54.540> something<00:01:55.259> sugary<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.860> sweet

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
of coke yes something sugary and sweet

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
of coke yes something sugary and sweet
again<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> replace<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.930> glycogen<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the day and then you're probably going

to<00:02:08.129> eat<00:02:08.310> dinner<00:02:08.520> after<00:02:08.910> your<00:02:09.030> workout<00:02:09.479> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
to eat dinner after your workout so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.630 
to eat dinner after your workout so
there<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.200> more<00:02:10.679> than<00:02:10.860> enough<00:02:10.920> protein

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640

losing any weight so after an intense
workout<00:02:32.120> carbohydrates<00:02:33.120> are<00:02:33.120> probably<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
workout carbohydrates are probably the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.949 
workout carbohydrates are probably the
best<00:02:34.350> now<00:02:35.340> should<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.570> you're

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
best now should you do this if you're

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.740 
best now should you do this if you're
trying<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.410> lose<00:02:37.470> weight<00:02:38.540> probably<00:02:39.540> not

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
trying to lose weight probably not

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.199 
trying to lose weight probably not
because<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:41.069> you're<00:02:41.340> trying<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.700> lose<00:02:41.760> weight

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
because if you're trying to lose weight

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.900 
because if you're trying to lose weight
you've<00:02:42.690> got<00:02:42.930> extra<00:02:43.530> body<00:02:43.709> fat<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:44.730> not

you've got extra body fat and I'm not

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
important thing is a carbohydrate drink

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.729 
important thing is a carbohydrate drink
after<00:03:29.850> your<00:03:29.970> workout<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.690> starts<00:03:31.170> the
