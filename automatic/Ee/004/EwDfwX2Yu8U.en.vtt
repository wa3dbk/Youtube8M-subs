00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
most and i thought it looks really cool

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.380 
most and i thought it looks really cool
and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.369> there's<00:01:17.549> some<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.000> when<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> guy

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and then there's some like when the guy

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
and then there's some like when the guy
turns<00:01:18.840> around<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.680> catch<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.189> from<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
turns around or if you catch me from the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.539 
turns around or if you catch me from the
side<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.180> changes<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:22.650> animation

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
side you know it changes the animation

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.340 
side you know it changes the animation
and<00:01:23.759> i<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.180> that's<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.630> awesome<00:01:24.900> remix

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and i think that's really awesome remix

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.730 
and i think that's really awesome remix
again

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.460 

the<00:01:28.740> team<00:01:29.310> deathmatch<00:01:30.110> spawns<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.700> crazy<00:01:32.700> I

the team deathmatch spawns are crazy I
still<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.500> understand<00:01:34.890> how<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.160> work<00:01:35.190> yet

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.590 
it's it's like a free-for-all game in
quality<00:02:12.930> where<00:02:13.080> everything<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.620> just

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
quality where everything is just

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.449 
quality where everything is just
willy-nilly<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:16.260> everybody<00:02:16.770> scattered

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
willy-nilly like everybody scattered

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.460 
willy-nilly like everybody scattered
everywhere<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.940> enemies<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:19.050> scattered

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
everywhere to enemies or scattered

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.050 
everywhere to enemies or scattered
everywhere<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.070> right<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.790> spawn

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
everywhere if you right when you spawn

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.790 
everywhere if you right when you spawn
you<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.360> kill<00:02:21.570> an<00:02:21.690> enemy<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:22.200> quickly<00:02:22.620> and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
you can kill an enemy really quickly and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000 
you can kill an enemy really quickly and
then<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.690> game<00:02:24.840> progresses<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.620> spawns

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
then as the game progresses the spawns

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.000 
then as the game progresses the spawns
kind<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.489> shift<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.600> where<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.680> one

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
kind of like shift to where it's one

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.000 
kind of like shift to where it's one
side<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.440> teams<00:02:31.650> controlling

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
side like one if one teams controlling

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.350 
side like one if one teams controlling
one<00:02:32.130> side<00:02:32.340> they<00:02:32.459> spawn<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.090> another

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
one side they spawn there and another

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.759 
one side they spawn there and another
tank<00:02:33.660> controls<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.989> other<00:02:34.140> side<00:02:34.320> they<00:02:34.530> spawn

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
tank controls the other side they spawn

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.190 
tank controls the other side they spawn
there<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.280> think<00:02:35.730> they<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.660> won't

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
there I think they do that so it won't

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.199 
there I think they do that so it won't
have<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.830> won't<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> specific<00:02:38.519> spawn

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
have you won't have a specific spawn

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.660 
have you won't have a specific spawn
from<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.200> beginning<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:41.310> where<00:02:41.489> you

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
from the beginning and so where you

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.150 
from the beginning and so where you
don't<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.970> spawn<00:02:42.330> trapped<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.860> work

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
don't get spawn trapped and you work

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.370 
don't get spawn trapped and you work
like<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.390> get<00:02:45.510> spawn<00:02:45.720> trap<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.260> own

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
like if you get spawn trap it's your own

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.630 
like if you get spawn trap it's your own
fault<00:02:46.410> basically<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.220> not<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> game's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
fault basically it's not the game's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.270 
fault basically it's not the game's
fault<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.320> putting<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.739> those

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
fault for putting you in those

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.250 
fault for putting you in those
situations<00:02:51.380> but<00:02:52.380> um<00:02:52.880> yeah<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.570> that's<00:02:55.079> how

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
situations but um yeah that's that's how

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.170 
situations but um yeah that's that's how
I<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:55.950> work<00:02:56.250> about<00:02:56.489> correct

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
I think this one is work about correct

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.479 
I think this one is work about correct
me<00:02:57.269> if<00:02:57.329> I'm<00:02:57.540> wrong<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:57.950> that's<00:02:58.950> how<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.190> looks

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
me if I'm wrong but that's how it looks

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.510 
me if I'm wrong but that's how it looks
like<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.970> far<00:03:01.400> let's<00:03:02.400> see

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
like so far let's see

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.360 
like so far let's see
I'm<00:03:04.390> not<00:03:04.540> sure<00:03:04.600> for<00:03:04.810> cities<00:03:05.080> brom<00:03:05.260> i'm<00:03:06.010> using

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
I'm not sure for cities brom i'm using

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.170 
I'm not sure for cities brom i'm using
the<00:03:06.790> ump<00:03:07.330> with<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.320> laser<00:03:08.590> sight<00:03:09.120> that's<00:03:10.120> a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
the ump with the laser sight that's a

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.100 
the ump with the laser sight that's a
laser<00:03:10.420> sight<00:03:10.690> with<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.740> laser<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:13.020> with<00:03:14.020> the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
laser sight with the laser and with the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.410 
laser sight with the laser and with the
holographic<00:03:14.560> sight<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.100> I'm<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.490> I<00:03:15.880> chose<00:03:16.270> his

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
holographic sight and I'm I I chose his

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.040 
holographic sight and I'm I I chose his
gun<00:03:16.570> because<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.110> games<00:03:17.950> before<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:19.600> was

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
gun because the games before this I was

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.970 
gun because the games before this I was
using<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.950> m4<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.770> that<00:03:23.770> gun<00:03:23.950> was

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
using the m4 and that that gun was

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.770 
using the m4 and that that gun was
pretty<00:03:24.280> good<00:03:24.460> I<00:03:24.730> mean<00:03:25.030> afford<00:03:25.330> assault<00:03:25.600> class

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
pretty good I mean afford assault class

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.810 
pretty good I mean afford assault class
of<00:03:25.960> things<00:03:26.110> m16a3<00:03:27.040> or<00:03:27.400> something<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:27.760> that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
of things m16a3 or something like that

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.880 
of things m16a3 or something like that
that's<00:03:28.450> pretty<00:03:28.630> good<00:03:28.780> gun<00:03:28.960> but<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> unlocked

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
that's pretty good gun but I unlocked

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.320 
that's pretty good gun but I unlocked
this<00:03:30.070> one<00:03:30.250> for<00:03:30.400> all<00:03:30.490> classes<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.030> wanted<00:03:31.270> to

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
this one for all classes so I wanted to

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.730 
this one for all classes so I wanted to
figure<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.690> out<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.200> wanted<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.560> use<00:03:32.710> it

pour it up I think I'm going into the
cage<00:03:39.250> right<00:03:39.400> now<00:03:39.550> this<00:03:39.610> is<00:03:39.790> where<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.300> start

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
cage right now this is where I start

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.040 
cage right now this is where I start
like<00:03:41.170> tonight<00:03:41.500> was<00:03:41.680> really<00:03:41.980> they<00:03:42.250> just<00:03:42.280> knife
