00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.110
 king of moses that already only in his 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.819
 digital and physical format next year 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 What is missing your partner I will be 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.149
 satisfied certainly does not miss in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.130
 the personal plane you do not get used to 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.509
 many years many years we keep the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.619
 friendship agree to mention what 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.539
 more we find out friendship shows us 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.780
 with communication and if when he has ten 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.819
 years dividing the job oit has a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 format already established then how 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.200
 start over but otherwise everything 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.149
 It is very good 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.619
 we are in this very special project 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.450
 obviously because the first one like 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.950
 soloist and let's keep the wave 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.450
 romantic for everyone the variety 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.179
 musical that we always have bachata 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.159
 meringue ballad romantic reggaeton 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.229
 dense of all that kind of mind music 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.149
 always liked we will keep the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.220
 essence of what romanticism was in 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.230
 my lyrics indications but everything very 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.410
 well we are very happy because that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.700
 duo decides on each one you can take your 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.930
 course in their careers 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.410
 it was necessary since the group already 10 years 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.129
 we did many beautiful things 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.950
 practically everyone 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.050
 I remember a few years ago in Viña del Mar 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.239
 you ravaged they ate it thank you 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.760
 to God we have the blessing I have 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.959
 many beautiful memories that were 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.940
 they really served as a school for me 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.170
 then undertake this new stage all 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.450
 it was very cool is here is me 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.910
 doing his job too and I think that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.730
 it was already had to take new goals not 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.040
 then course is part of life not going 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.200
 touched at this time then take roads 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.730
 separately in the professional plane and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.110
 we are both doing the same for 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.180
 continue our solitary career 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.239
 this time as unreal 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.269
 when there are successful tubes in any 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.340
 music genre that separate the case 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.280
 of wisin and yandel good is every case 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.130
 obviously because it is different not on the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.590
 we did have a lot of success everything was 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.680
 cool a group that thank God we 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.750
 announced but there is already a moment in 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.120
 that you have your own dream your own 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.850
 mind then time is running no 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.120
 no no can not be selfish 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.110
 to retain someone or try to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.910
 stay in the same 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.430
 that number you get to invent and 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.870
 creating new new things because for 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.000
 survive in this industry so true 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.920
 so competitive and simply force what 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.460
 that we did each one is prayer that 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.690
 wants we say in harmony and 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.880
 as it deserves not as a pérez in finishing 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.160
 professional relationships that good 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.750
 they become family members 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.370
 because so much time dealing with the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.380

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.480
