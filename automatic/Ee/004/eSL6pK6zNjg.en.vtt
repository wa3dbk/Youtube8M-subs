00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
pretty cool too runes take a lot of work

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.790 
pretty cool too runes take a lot of work
to<00:00:21.090> balance<00:00:21.210> considering<00:00:22.020> every<00:00:22.320> champion

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
to balance considering every champion

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.439

needs to be checked with them for edge

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
needs to be checked with them for edge
cases<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.500> brokenness<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:27.000> it's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
cases and brokenness and you know it's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.720 
cases and brokenness and you know it's
complicated<00:00:28.130> everything<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.279> today<00:00:29.519> will

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
complicated everything here today will

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.310 
complicated everything here today will
be<00:00:29.820> concerned<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.300> Tier<00:00:30.660> three<00:00:30.750> because

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
be concerned with Tier three because

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.410 
be concerned with Tier three because
let's<00:00:31.859> face<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.340> runes<00:00:32.790> aren't<00:00:33.059> worth<00:00:33.180> buying

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
let's face it runes aren't worth buying

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.410 
let's face it runes aren't worth buying
for<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.930> point<00:00:34.160> we<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:35.280> begin<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.120> top

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
for that point we will begin at the top

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.630 
for that point we will begin at the top
of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> list<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.079> seals<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.129> riot<00:00:38.370> did

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of the list with seals just as riot did

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.479 
of the list with seals just as riot did
the<00:00:39.450> flat<00:00:39.899> armor<00:00:40.170> seals<00:00:40.200> got<00:00:40.770> significantly

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the flat armor seals got significantly

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.970 
the flat armor seals got significantly
nerfed<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.090> yet<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> same<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.440> they're

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
nerfed and yet at the same time they're

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880 
nerfed and yet at the same time they're
just<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.579> good<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:45.289> compensation<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
just as good as compensation for the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.310 
just as good as compensation for the
changes<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.550> champions<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.570> getting<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.960> plus

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
changes all champions are getting a plus

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.250 
changes all champions are getting a plus
for<00:00:49.649> armor<00:00:50.250> bonus<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> take<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> full

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
for armor bonus so if you take a full

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.080 
for armor bonus so if you take a full
set<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> them<00:00:52.800> you'll<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.879> much

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
set of them you'll have just as much

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.959 
set of them you'll have just as much
armor<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> did<00:00:55.770> before<00:00:55.969> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
armor going in as you did before this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
armor going in as you did before this
means<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.480> don't<00:00:57.809> lose<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.320> don't

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
means you don't lose out there don't

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
means you don't lose out there don't
have<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> change<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.059> want

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
have to change a thing if you don't want

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.020 
have to change a thing if you don't want
to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.170> main<00:01:01.590> point<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.190> change<00:01:02.489> then<00:01:02.789> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
to the main point of this change then is

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.969 
to the main point of this change then is
to<00:01:03.239> open<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.690> competitive<00:01:04.229> space<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to open up competitive space for the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.760 
to open up competitive space for the
other<00:01:05.189> seals<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.229> scaling<00:01:07.229> armor<00:01:07.500> for

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
other seals here scaling armor for

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.469 
other seals here scaling armor for
example<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> quite<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> bit<00:01:08.880> stronger<00:01:09.210> by

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
example is quite a bit stronger by

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
example is quite a bit stronger by
comparison<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.950> evaluating<00:01:11.520> scaling<00:01:11.970> runes

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
comparison when evaluating scaling runes

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
comparison when evaluating scaling runes
against<00:01:12.600> their<00:01:12.750> flat<00:01:12.990> counterparts<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.130> need

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
against their flat counterparts we need

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
against their flat counterparts we need
to<00:01:14.460> know<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:14.909> point<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.780> beat<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to know at what point they beat the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.830 
to know at what point they beat the
value<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.939> scaling<00:01:17.939> runes<00:01:18.119> become<00:01:18.509> stronger

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
value all scaling runes become stronger

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.740 
value all scaling runes become stronger
at<00:01:19.049> some<00:01:19.290> point<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.890> how<00:01:20.250> quickly<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
at some point but how quickly on that

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
at some point but how quickly on that
front<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> say<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> scaling<00:01:23.460> armor<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
front we can say that scaling armor is

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.170 
front we can say that scaling armor is
now<00:01:24.299> much<00:01:24.840> more<00:01:25.200> viable<00:01:25.520> where<00:01:26.520> previously<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
now much more viable where previously it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.999 
now much more viable where previously it
took<00:01:27.479> until<00:01:27.630> level<00:01:27.960> tin<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> match

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
took until level tin for them to match

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
took until level tin for them to match
up<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:29.880> equal<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> flat<00:01:30.720> rooms<00:01:31.049> at

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
up they now equal the flat rooms at

up they now equal the flat rooms at
level<00:01:31.560> 6<00:01:31.890> add<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> extra<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.840> armor
