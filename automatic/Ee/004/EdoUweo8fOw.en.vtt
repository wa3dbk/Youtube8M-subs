after<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.170> November<00:02:07.380> election<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.459> don't

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
after the November election and I don't

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.490

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.820 
I don't think that would be very fun but
hey<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:14.720> what<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> think<00:02:15.260> tell<00:02:15.470> me<00:02:15.560> what<00:02:15.709> you
