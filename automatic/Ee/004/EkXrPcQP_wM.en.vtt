bit about how you try to bounce a little
bit<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> both<00:00:56.039> while<00:00:56.309> bringing<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:56.910> adults

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bit of both while bringing more adults

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.209 
bit of both while bringing more adults
viewing<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.629> keeping<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> PG

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
viewing but keeping it kind of in the PG

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:09.260 
viewing but keeping it kind of in the PG
format<00:01:03.500> we<00:01:05.090> actually<00:01:07.400> used<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.670> used<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
format we actually used to be used to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
format we actually used to be used to
put<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.840> adult<00:01:10.200> stuff<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> more<00:01:10.920> squares

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
put more adult stuff and more squares

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.130 
put more adult stuff and more squares
and<00:01:11.610> things<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.049> naturally<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and things like that naturally that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
and things like that naturally that
you've<00:01:13.320> been<00:01:13.439> telling<00:01:13.650> us<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.979> rain<00:01:14.159> again

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.210 

but<00:01:18.870> ultimately<00:01:19.870> I<00:01:19.930> think<00:01:20.020> it's<00:01:20.290> really

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
but ultimately I think it's really

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:34.770 
but ultimately I think it's really
satisfying<00:01:32.370> like<00:01:33.370> shows<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.640> tremendous<00:01:33.910> image

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
satisfying like shows a tremendous image

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:52.520 
satisfying like shows a tremendous image
that<00:01:35.050> shows<00:01:35.260> like<00:01:35.380> funny<00:01:37.860> kids<00:01:38.860> show<00:01:49.229> voices

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.480 

there's<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.619> lot<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.890> times<00:01:54.100> where<00:01:54.400> this

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
there's a lot of times where this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.910 
there's a lot of times where this
alternate<00:01:55.000> line<00:01:55.180> master<00:01:55.630> I'll<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.500> line

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
alternate line master I'll have a line

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.070 
alternate line master I'll have a line
that<00:01:57.100> they<00:01:57.160> want<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.270> try<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.690> away<00:01:58.810> with

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
that they want to try and get away with

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.450 
that they want to try and get away with
and<00:01:59.259> then<00:01:59.350> they<00:01:59.440> have<00:01:59.590> like<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.220> that

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
and then they have like the one that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.090 
and then they have like the one that
they<00:02:00.850> think<00:02:01.060> they'll<00:02:01.479> be<00:02:01.600> allowed<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.140> or

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
they think they'll be allowed to do or

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.440 
they think they'll be allowed to do or
they<00:02:03.220> may<00:02:03.369> be<00:02:03.400> sometimes<00:02:03.910> someone<00:02:04.270> will<00:02:04.300> have

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
they may be sometimes someone will have

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.070 
they may be sometimes someone will have
like<00:02:04.900> JJ<00:02:05.259> or<00:02:05.380> somebody<00:02:05.680> will<00:02:05.800> have<00:02:05.890> an<00:02:06.009> idea

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
like JJ or somebody will have an idea

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.900 
like JJ or somebody will have an idea
get<00:02:08.080> away<00:02:08.259> with<00:02:08.470> but<00:02:08.709> ultimately<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:09.820> a

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
get away with but ultimately it's a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.449 
get away with but ultimately it's a
little<00:02:10.149> suggestive<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:11.590> what<00:02:12.100> kids<00:02:12.280> won't

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
little suggestive it's what kids won't

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.670 
little suggestive it's what kids won't
pick<00:02:12.640> up<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> but<00:02:13.959> sometimes<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.440> one's

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.150 
mean I just briefly as we can I guess
with<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.260> time<00:03:02.410> we<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.620> available

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
with the time we have available

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.470 
with the time we have available
I<00:03:03.190> say<00:03:03.400> we<00:03:03.520> through<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.670> process<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.270> making

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
I say we through the process of making

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.680 
I say we through the process of making
an<00:03:05.140> episode<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:07.360> show<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.760> at<00:03:10.060> first<00:03:10.330> we

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
an episode of the show so at first we

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.170 
an episode of the show so at first we
have<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.290> writers<00:03:13.170> write<00:03:14.170> an<00:03:14.350> outline<00:03:15.180> and
