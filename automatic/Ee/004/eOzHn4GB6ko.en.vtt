have plugin switches and modes you can

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.180 
have plugin switches and modes you can
select<00:00:38.989> that<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:39.530> you<00:00:39.620> actually<00:00:39.770> see<00:00:40.070> this

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
select a text layer so we're going to

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.829 
select a text layer so we're going to
create<00:00:44.390> some<00:00:44.570> text<00:00:44.899> over<00:00:45.079> here<00:00:46.780> we're<00:00:47.780> just

over here i'm going to select this
option<00:00:56.149> right<00:00:56.480> here<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.409> is<00:00:57.589> a<00:00:57.620> 3d<00:00:57.949> layer

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
option right here and this is a 3d layer

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.579 
option right here and this is a 3d layer
next<00:00:59.030> we're<00:00:59.179> going<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.329> select<00:00:59.539> raytrace<00:01:00.170> 3d

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
next we're going to select raytrace 3d

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.340 
next we're going to select raytrace 3d
and<00:01:01.149> then<00:01:02.149> over<00:01:02.269> here<00:01:02.390> we<00:01:02.539> can<00:01:02.629> select<00:01:02.780> options

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
right here i have a registration quality

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.850 
right here i have a registration quality
of<00:01:05.540> one<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.930> reason<00:01:06.200> why<00:01:06.320> we<00:01:06.470> have<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:06.770> like

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
of one the reason why we have it like

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.620 
of one the reason why we have it like
this<00:01:07.010> is<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:07.670> it's<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.880> lot<00:01:07.970> easier<00:01:08.150> faster

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
this is so it's a lot easier faster

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.149 
this is so it's a lot easier faster
they're<00:01:08.930> working<00:01:09.229> in<00:01:09.320> After<00:01:09.530> Effects<00:01:09.830> the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
they're working in After Effects the

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.280 
they're working in After Effects the
higher<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.520> quality<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.420> more<00:01:11.780> resources

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
higher the quality the more resources

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.840 
higher the quality the more resources
this<00:01:12.560> software<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:12.979> going<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.220> use<00:01:13.430> for<00:01:13.700> this

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
this software is going to use for this

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.160 
this software is going to use for this
feature<00:01:14.120> so<00:01:14.570> I'm<00:01:14.630> just<00:01:14.750> gonna<00:01:14.870> leave<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.080> at

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.210 
new and we're just select light and once
you<00:01:43.490> add<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.640> spotlight<00:01:44.200> tensity<00:01:45.200> says<00:01:45.470> 15<00:01:45.920> here

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
you add a spotlight tensity says 15 here

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.710 
you add a spotlight tensity says 15 here
but<00:01:46.400> let's<00:01:46.550> add<00:01:46.730> 50<00:01:47.680> select<00:01:48.680> ok<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:50.420> can<00:01:50.570> move

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
but let's add 50 select ok you can move

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.320 
but let's add 50 select ok you can move
the<00:01:50.870> light<00:01:51.020> around<00:01:51.140> if<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.470> want<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.860> then

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
the light around if you want to then

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.360 
the light around if you want to then
when<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.390> go<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.540> layer<00:01:53.810> new<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.130> select

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
when you go to layer new and select

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.550 
when you go to layer new and select
light<00:01:55.520> again<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:57.080> time<00:01:57.290> we're<00:01:57.410> going<00:01:57.500> to

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
light again this time we're going to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.060 
light again this time we're going to
select<00:01:57.680> point<00:01:58.570> let's<00:01:59.570> make<00:01:59.750> this<00:01:59.930> one<00:02:00.110> 25<00:02:03.070> then

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
select point let's make this one 25 then

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.040 
select point let's make this one 25 then
when<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.250> go<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.370> layer<00:02:04.580> new<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:05.810> slick

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
when you go to layer new and then slick

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.529 
when you go to layer new and then slick
light<00:02:06.230> again<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.060> this<00:02:08.060> time<00:02:08.119> we're<00:02:08.390> just

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
light again and this time we're just

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.530 
light again and this time we're just
like<00:02:08.659> ambient<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:10.090> we<00:02:11.090> can<00:02:11.239> make<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.540> one<00:02:11.980> 15

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
like ambient and we can make this one 15

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.119 
like ambient and we can make this one 15
now<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.599> lighting<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.379> applied<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.040> you

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
now the lighting is just applied so you

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.040 
now the lighting is just applied so you
have<00:02:16.370> different<00:02:16.610> lights<00:02:17.090> hitting<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.629> text

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
have different lights hitting the text

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.559 
have different lights hitting the text
because<00:02:18.379> it's<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.769> 3d<00:02:19.129> layer<00:02:19.340> net<00:02:19.640> next<00:02:20.480> what

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
because it's a 3d layer net next what

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.000 
because it's a 3d layer net next what
we're<00:02:20.660> going<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.110> apply<00:02:21.350> camera<00:02:21.860> where

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
we're going to do is apply camera where

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.370 
we're going to do is apply camera where
I'm<00:02:22.370> going<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> go<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.790> layer<00:02:23.000> new<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.990> then

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
I'm going to go to layer new and then

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.480 
I'm going to go to layer new and then
select<00:02:24.710> camera

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
select camera

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.590 
select camera
so<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.790> options<00:02:25.850> here<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.390> select

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
so you have options here to select

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.120 
so you have options here to select
different<00:02:26.630> ones<00:02:27.020> I'm<00:02:27.320> going<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.500> select<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.770> 15

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
different ones I'm going to select a 15

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.230 
different ones I'm going to select a 15
millimeter<00:02:28.430> camera<00:02:28.940> select<00:02:29.600> ok<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:31.240> then

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
millimeter camera select ok and then

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.350 
millimeter camera select ok and then
what<00:02:32.360> we<00:02:32.510> can<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.170> select<00:02:33.590> see<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.280> we<00:02:35.180> can

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
what we can do is select see and we can

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.770 
what we can do is select see and we can
move<00:02:35.510> around<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.900> text<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:37.450> that's<00:02:38.450> looking

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
move around the text and that's looking

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.510 
move around the text and that's looking
pretty<00:02:38.810> good<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.560> looks<00:02:39.740> like<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.890> 3d<00:02:40.280> layer

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
pretty good that looks like a 3d layer

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.910 
pretty good that looks like a 3d layer
and<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:41.900> hit<00:02:42.050> see<00:02:42.260> again<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.710> can<00:02:42.830> do

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
and if you hit see again you can do

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.610 
and if you hit see again you can do
different<00:02:43.070> things<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.640> spin<00:02:44.210> around<00:02:44.620> I'm

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
different things like spin around I'm

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.620 
different things like spin around I'm
gonna<00:02:45.710> hit<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:46.070> again<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.300> move<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
gonna hit see again you can move the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.380 
gonna hit see again you can move the
text<00:02:47.840> hit<00:02:48.590> see<00:02:48.830> again<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.840> can<00:02:50.930> zoom<00:02:51.140> in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
text hit see again and you can zoom in

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.490 
text hit see again and you can zoom in
so<00:02:53.390> that's<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.600> good<00:02:53.720> shortcut<00:02:54.080> if<00:02:54.380> you're

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
so that's a good shortcut if you're

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.280 
so that's a good shortcut if you're
working<00:02:54.620> with<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.890> camera<00:02:55.130> angle<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:57.170> next

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
working with a camera angle so next

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.360 
working with a camera angle so next
we're<00:02:57.470> going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.620> do<00:02:57.710> is<00:02:57.920> make<00:02:58.190> this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
we're going to do is make this

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.430 
we're going to do is make this
background<00:02:58.640> layer<00:02:58.970> three<00:02:59.360> day<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:03:00.110> going<00:03:00.350> to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
background layer three day I'm going to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.260 
background layer three day I'm going to
unlock<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.890> layer<00:03:01.010> right<00:03:01.730> click<00:03:01.790> on<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
unlock the layer right click on it and

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.950 
unlock the layer right click on it and
select<00:03:02.420> environment<00:03:03.410> layer<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.540> now<00:03:05.690> what<00:03:05.840> we

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
select environment layer so now what we

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.690 
select environment layer so now what we
can<00:03:06.110> do<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.500> select<00:03:06.740> this<00:03:06.920> camera<00:03:07.310> layer<00:03:07.490> and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
can do is select this camera layer and

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.400 
can do is select this camera layer and
then<00:03:08.090> what<00:03:08.270> happens<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.750> when<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.200> press

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
then what happens is that when we press

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.940 
then what happens is that when we press
C<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:09.950> then<00:03:10.130> spin<00:03:10.460> this<00:03:10.550> around<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:12.560> can<00:03:12.740> see

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
C and then spin this around you can see

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.460 
C and then spin this around you can see
all<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.370> background<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:15.020> looks<00:03:15.200> like

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
all of the background and it looks like

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.350 
all of the background and it looks like
you<00:03:15.680> know<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.920> text<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.460> spinning<00:03:16.790> around<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
you know the text is spinning around and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.150 
you know the text is spinning around and
the<00:03:17.720> background<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.200> 3d<00:03:18.560> now<00:03:18.740> rather<00:03:19.040> than

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
the background is 3d now rather than

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.370 
the background is 3d now rather than
just<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.520> flat<00:03:19.730> image<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.360> this<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.200> pretty

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
just a flat image and this is pretty

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.800 
just a flat image and this is pretty
cool<00:03:21.530> stuff<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.310> after<00:03:22.610> effects<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.240> then<00:03:23.690> if

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
cool stuff and after effects and then if

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.570 
cool stuff and after effects and then if
we<00:03:23.960> want<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.260> add<00:03:24.530> some<00:03:24.770> animation<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.430> this

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
we want to add some animation to this

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.890 
we want to add some animation to this
it's<00:03:25.760> pretty<00:03:25.910> easy<00:03:26.120> right<00:03:26.450> here<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
it's pretty easy right here on the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.750 
it's pretty easy right here on the
drop-down<00:03:27.140> layer<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.740> camera<00:03:28.100> we<00:03:28.610> can

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
drop-down layer of the camera we can

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.670 
drop-down layer of the camera we can
change<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.180> orientation<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:30.170> i<00:03:30.230> can<00:03:30.530> select

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
change the orientation so i can select

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.070 
change the orientation so i can select
one<00:03:30.980> keyframe<00:03:31.190> over<00:03:31.670> here<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.090> then<00:03:32.750> all<00:03:32.990> i

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
one keyframe over here and then all i

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.230 
one keyframe over here and then all i
have<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.260> do<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.860> adjust<00:03:34.340> this<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.150> going

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
to add another keyframe and then when i

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.590 
to add another keyframe and then when i
scrub<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.040> timeline<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.670> moves<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.390> camera

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
the position so i have one keyframe from

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.060 
the position so i have one keyframe from
there<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.450> let's<00:03:47.600> see<00:03:47.690> what<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:47.930> looks<00:03:47.990> like
