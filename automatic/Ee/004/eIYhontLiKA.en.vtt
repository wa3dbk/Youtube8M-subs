00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.790
 so hello everyone today I will show a little bit 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.599
 improved lesson on raising 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:18.619
 alpha channel using displacement map 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:22.410
 To do this, we create our normal Plain and 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:26.150
 further i did not made polymesh3d 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 translate it into a three-dimensional object and 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.489
 go to the geometry tab add 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.120
 tevaida 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.210
 stuff five 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.879
 further displacement map and before 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.550
 displacement map create a layer further go 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.469
 in alpha we take some standard 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:55.219
 alpha raise the intensity let's say 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:01.520
 to 0 4 let's say we press warm 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:04.409
 alpha channel is being received and 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.309
 it is further regulated by 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.309
 scroll 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.500
 that is, no brushes 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.799
 use given to get rid of 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.840
 rear play on push combination 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.759
 keys kontrol shift that is, doing here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 such here 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:31.220
 we hold down the frame alt and our 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.220
 frame 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.540
 so it is necessary to bake bake layer before this 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:44.270
 layer on the level at which we need 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:49.850
 further hide the backdrop go to the tab it 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:55.640
 the diameter and the mule of the fight executioners you years 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:59.000
 chitin so before the years we delete another level 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.390
 divides the hidden ie the whole backdrop 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.530
 removed he will say neither hide now 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 he removed and then just raise 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.150
 resolution level we press the dynamo and 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.800
 we have a backdrop 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.610
 then you can work with him as 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.610
 ordinary object 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.560
 that's all
