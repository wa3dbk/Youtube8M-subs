00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.450
 how to create a partition on a disk 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.090
 hard that is to divide a hard disk of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.420
 way it looks like two 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.550
 for this we are going to click on start and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.880
 says team where we will give click 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.060
 right in administer us appears the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 equipment management window 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.920
 let's give it in the option 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.840
 record management 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.390
 hard disks will appear 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.890
 installed on our computer in my 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.180
 case I have the disk 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.160
 with 140 gigas and the disk with 8 gigs 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.680
 and a little more 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.950
 to create a new partition we are going to 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.830
 right click on the disk that 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.020
 we want in this case the cy we are going to 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.090
 give you the option to reduce volume now it 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.250
 is scanning the volume size in 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.560
 this window we will choose the size of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.950
 our new partition 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.340
 for example if in the box here 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.790
 we put two thousand megabytes that means a 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.680
 partition of two gigas if we put ten 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.090
 thousand megabytes that means a partition of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.770
 10 gigas 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.040
 let's make a small partition of 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.130
 500 megabytes ie half way 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.000
 we put the 500 there and we give it to reduce 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.590
 we wait while you work ready 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.190
 we see that the new one has been created 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.010
 partition of 500 megabytes but still appears 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.350
 with a black stripe this means that 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.910
 yet we can use if we enter 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.640
 our disc we see that it still does not appear 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.220
 what we are going to do now is create it 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.480
 as a partition itself we click on 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.600
 right and let's go to new simple volume 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.580
 we give it to next that we leave it such 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 how is it 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.170
 here we assign the letter that goes to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.980
 have our new partition with this 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.980
 I'm going to put a glass here 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.189
 following 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.250
 here we have to choose the options of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.790
 format the file system that goes to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.520
 be ntfs the same the size of the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.300
 assignment the default and the name 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.300
 of our new volume 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.340
 we can choose to give you a quick format 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.349
 but to do the first time we have 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.269
 than to give it a full format without 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.950
 But this time I'm going to give you a 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.530
 Quick format so you can see how it is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.469
 we go to next and ready all the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.290
 configuration we give you to finalize and 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.540
 ready a new partition has been created 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.590
 it appears here but we see that it is still 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.780
 empty we just created it 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.930
 have we close our new 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.030
 partition if we want to eliminate the go 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.940
 to give it right click delete volume 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.040
 and we give it if it now appears as a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.110
 amount not allocated to recover that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.450
 space and integrate it back to the disk 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.660
 we are going to 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.730
 to give 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.690
 let's right click on the disk ce 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.840
 in extend next volume and here 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.270
 is the disk that we had created of 500 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.480
 megas is already selected we give to 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.120
 next and finalize and as we see the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.580
 disk has been returned to its original size 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.909
 that's all I hope to have explained 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.040
 well and as you can see it's easy to create 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.930
 a partition on a hard drive 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.000
 I hope you liked this 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.430
