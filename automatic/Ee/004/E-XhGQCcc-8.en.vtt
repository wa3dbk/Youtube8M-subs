hey<00:00:01.140> it's<00:00:01.319> Greek<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.770> jacuz<00:00:02.159> Roux<00:00:02.370> here<00:00:02.879> with<00:00:03.120> a

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hey it's Greek a jacuz Roux here with a

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.280 
hey it's Greek a jacuz Roux here with a
prototype<00:00:03.959> video<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.569> very<00:00:06.569> very<00:00:06.899> early

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
prototype video this is very very early

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.100 
prototype video this is very very early
stage<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.890> something<00:00:08.309> I'm<00:00:08.429> trying<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.760> build

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
stage of something I'm trying to build

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.640 
stage of something I'm trying to build
basically<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.550> miniature<00:00:12.509> scuba<00:00:13.410> tank

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
basically it is a miniature scuba tank

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.560 
basically it is a miniature scuba tank
and<00:00:14.089> it<00:00:15.089> features<00:00:15.509> these<00:00:15.750> two<00:00:17.119> really<00:00:18.119> small

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and it features these two really small

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.700 
and it features these two really small
oxygen<00:00:19.320> tanks<00:00:19.939> that<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.390> originally<00:00:22.320> used

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
oxygen tanks that are originally used

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.750 
oxygen tanks that are originally used
for<00:00:23.869> oxidated<00:00:24.869> water<00:00:25.160> which<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.310> guess<00:00:26.490> there's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
for oxidated water which I guess there's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.359 
for oxidated water which I guess there's
this<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.359> health<00:00:28.050> benefit<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.890> drinking

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
this like health benefit to drinking

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.490 
this like health benefit to drinking
seltzer<00:00:29.849> water<00:00:30.289> with<00:00:31.289> oxygen<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:33.170> they<00:00:34.170> sell

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
seltzer water with oxygen so they sell

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
seltzer water with oxygen so they sell
these<00:00:34.710> oxy<00:00:35.430> plus<00:00:35.809> original<00:00:38.059> octopus

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
these oxy plus original octopus

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.080 
these oxy plus original octopus
cartridges<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.590> doesn't<00:00:40.980> say<00:00:41.250> anything<00:00:41.820> about

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
cartridges it doesn't say anything about

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.630 
cartridges it doesn't say anything about
the<00:00:42.300> size<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> bought<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.550> was

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the size so when I bought these it was

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.569 
the size so when I bought these it was
really<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.300> shot<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> dark<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.399> like

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
really a shot in the dark but I got like

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
really a shot in the dark but I got like
four<00:00:47.940> boxes<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.480> 10<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.140> 40<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.710> these<00:00:49.829> things

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
four boxes a 10 so 40 of these things

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.910 
four boxes a 10 so 40 of these things
for<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.120> twelve<00:00:51.660> dollars<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> good<00:00:52.710> deal

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
for like twelve dollars was a good deal

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180 
for like twelve dollars was a good deal
and<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.699> figured<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> heck<00:00:54.750> why<00:00:54.960> not

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and I figured what the heck why not

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
and I figured what the heck why not
and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:57.360> also<00:00:57.750> picked<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:58.680> eBay<00:00:59.280> these<00:01:00.770> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and I also picked up off eBay these I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
and I also picked up off eBay these I
think<00:01:02.250> there's<00:01:02.430> six<00:01:02.670> gram<00:01:02.910> cartridges<00:01:03.570> or

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
think there's six gram cartridges or

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.660 
think there's six gram cartridges or
something

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
something

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
something
they're<00:01:06.030> adapters<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.850> co2<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.229> put

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
they're adapters for co2 so you can put

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.090 
they're adapters for co2 so you can put
this<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:12.290> paintball<00:01:13.290> gun<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.560> instead

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
this on your paintball gun and instead

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.030 
this on your paintball gun and instead
of<00:01:14.220> running<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.810> large<00:01:15.810> co2<00:01:16.439> tanks<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of running off of large co2 tanks you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
of running off of large co2 tanks you
use<00:01:17.310> these<00:01:17.900> small<00:01:19.460> six<00:01:20.460> gram<00:01:20.670> cartridges<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.509> I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
use these small six gram cartridges or I

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.770 
use these small six gram cartridges or I
forget<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.530> size<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.159> exactly<00:01:23.759> but

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.100 

this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.770> perfect<00:01:29.220> size<00:01:29.630> all<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.840> need<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
this is the perfect size all I need to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
this is the perfect size all I need to
do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:32.009> extend<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:35.270> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
do is just extend this so that when you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.620 
do is just extend this so that when you
screw<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.799> punctures<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.670> seal<00:01:38.970> also

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
screw it down it punctures the seal also

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.800 
screw it down it punctures the seal also
need<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> cut<00:01:40.500> off<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.250> piece<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.329> plastic

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
need to cut off this piece of plastic

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810 
need to cut off this piece of plastic
here<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.740> don't<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.280> understand<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
here which I don't really understand the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
here which I don't really understand the
purpose<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.360> guess<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.860> will<00:01:46.979> come<00:01:47.100> off<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
purpose I guess but it will come off and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
purpose I guess but it will come off and
then<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.180> should<00:01:49.430> adhere<00:01:50.570> I'm<00:01:51.570> sorry<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
then it should adhere I'm sorry it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950 
then it should adhere I'm sorry it
should<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.740> punctured<00:01:53.340> by<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.750> as<00:01:54.750> long<00:01:54.930> as

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
should be punctured by this as long as

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.719 
should be punctured by this as long as
there's<00:01:55.200> enough<00:01:55.439> pressure<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.579> might

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
there's enough pressure so there might

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
there's enough pressure so there might
be<00:01:56.759> some<00:01:56.880> trial<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> error<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.439> eventually

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
be some trial and error but eventually

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.330 
be some trial and error but eventually
I'll<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> and<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.880> same<00:02:03.149> thing<00:02:03.799> with<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I'll get it and the same thing with the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.449 
I'll get it and the same thing with the
the<00:02:07.640> co2<00:02:08.640> cartridge<00:02:09.679> for<00:02:10.679> making<00:02:11.009> an<00:02:11.069> airtight

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the co2 cartridge for making an airtight

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.930 
the co2 cartridge for making an airtight
seal

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
seal

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.420 
seal
I'm<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.600> have<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.040> screw<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.190> into

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
I'm going to have to screw this into

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.480 
I'm going to have to screw this into
some<00:02:15.820> type<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.270> tea<00:02:16.750> valve<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:18.010> will<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.310> up

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
some type of tea valve that will go up

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.470 
some type of tea valve that will go up
to<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.700> mouthpiece<00:02:19.770> possibly<00:02:20.770> something<00:02:21.480> maybe

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
to a mouthpiece possibly something maybe

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.440 
to a mouthpiece possibly something maybe
I'll<00:02:22.660> modify<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:24.490> H<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:26.910> I'm<00:02:27.910> sorry<00:02:28.210> the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
have your co2 tank kind of hold in the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.280 
have your co2 tank kind of hold in the
middle<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.350> sorry<00:03:17.620> not<00:03:17.739> your<00:03:17.830> co2<00:03:18.190> tank<00:03:18.430> your

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
middle and sorry not your co2 tank your

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.750 
middle and sorry not your co2 tank your
mouthpiece<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.970> can<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.520> can

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
mouthpiece so that it can so you can

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.580 
mouthpiece so that it can so you can
breathe<00:03:25.030> from<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.660> then<00:03:26.380> that's

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
breathe from it and then that's

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.479 
breathe from it and then that's
basically<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:28.060> this<00:03:28.600> might<00:03:28.870> be<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:29.489> larger

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
basically it so this might be a larger

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.780 
basically it so this might be a larger
like<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:30.910> bulkier<00:03:31.420> version<00:03:32.050> of<00:03:32.459> what<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.640> end

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
like a bulkier version of what the end

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.660 
like a bulkier version of what the end
product<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.360> going<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.570> be<00:03:34.800> but<00:03:35.800> if<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.400> pull

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
product is going to be but if I can pull

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.400 
product is going to be but if I can pull
this<00:03:36.820> off<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:37.360> going<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.570> be<00:03:37.720> really<00:03:38.080> really

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
this off it's going to be really really

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.270 
this off it's going to be really really

interesting double-oh-seven James Bond
had<00:03:43.030> something<00:03:43.450> similar<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.019> this<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:45.610> one<00:03:45.850> of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
had something similar to this in one of

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.870 
had something similar to this in one of
his<00:03:46.090> movies<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.959> I'm<00:03:47.290> going<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.500> try<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.280> post

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
his movies so I'm going to try and post

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.320 
his movies so I'm going to try and post
a<00:03:49.410> picture<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.920> what<00:03:51.430> I'm<00:03:51.640> basically<00:03:52.030> trying

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
a picture of what I'm basically trying

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.020 
a picture of what I'm basically trying
to<00:03:52.540> make<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:53.590> looks<00:03:53.800> really<00:03:54.130> similar<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.640> these

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
to make it looks really similar to these

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.360 
to make it looks really similar to these
cartridges<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.880> oxygen<00:03:58.780> plus<00:03:59.080> is<00:03:59.380> basically

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
cartridges the oxygen plus is basically

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.440 
cartridges the oxygen plus is basically
this<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:01.360> almost<00:04:02.080> his<00:04:02.650> exact<00:04:03.010> size<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.730> he

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
this but almost his exact size and he

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.560 
this but almost his exact size and he
just<00:04:04.660> puts<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.410> he<00:04:05.950> just<00:04:06.100> some<00:04:06.400> puts<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.360> on<00:04:07.450> his

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
just puts it he just some puts it on his

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.420 
just puts it he just some puts it on his
mouth<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.019> then<00:04:08.170> he's<00:04:08.800> able<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.160> breathe

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
mouth and then he's able to breathe

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.310 
mouth and then he's able to breathe
underwater<00:04:09.820> for<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.480> short<00:04:10.780> amount<00:04:11.140> of<00:04:11.260> time

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
underwater for a short amount of time

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.710 
underwater for a short amount of time
just<00:04:12.310> as<00:04:12.459> an<00:04:12.580> emergency<00:04:13.209> purpose<00:04:13.570> this

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
just as an emergency purpose this

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.620 
just as an emergency purpose this
wouldn't<00:04:14.110> be<00:04:14.200> something<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.709> you'd<00:04:14.860> go

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
wouldn't be something that you'd go

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.380 
wouldn't be something that you'd go
diving<00:04:16.630> with<00:04:16.870> or<00:04:17.200> something<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:17.650> is<00:04:17.709> more

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
diving with or something this is more

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.010 
diving with or something this is more
for<00:04:19.390> secret<00:04:19.900> agents<00:04:20.320> or<00:04:20.440> something<00:04:20.830> so<00:04:21.520> I

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
for secret agents or something so I

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.360 
for secret agents or something so I
think<00:04:23.020> would<00:04:23.260> be<00:04:23.289> really<00:04:23.560> interesting<00:04:24.130> if<00:04:24.250> I

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
think would be really interesting if I

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.310 
think would be really interesting if I
could<00:04:24.550> pull<00:04:25.030> this<00:04:25.180> off

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
could pull this off

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.900 
could pull this off
so<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:28.740> said<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.310> just<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.670> really

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
so like I said this is just a really

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.950 
so like I said this is just a really
early-stage<00:04:30.830> prototype<00:04:32.240> more<00:04:33.240> like<00:04:33.450> an<00:04:33.570> idea

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
early-stage prototype more like an idea

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.310 
early-stage prototype more like an idea
at<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:34.620> point<00:04:34.950> but<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:36.300> think<00:04:36.900> I'll<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.200> able

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
at this point but I think I'll be able

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.280 
at this point but I think I'll be able
to<00:04:37.470> pull<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.770> off<00:04:37.890> if<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:39.000> get<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.390> piece<00:04:40.260> that

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
to pull it off if I can get a piece that

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.920 
to pull it off if I can get a piece that
can<00:04:40.740> connect<00:04:41.070> these<00:04:41.250> two<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.420> can<00:04:42.630> drill

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
can connect these two and I can drill

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.370 
can connect these two and I can drill
down<00:04:43.140> and<00:04:43.560> do<00:04:44.430> something<00:04:44.850> similar<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.660> my<00:04:46.650> co2

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
down and do something similar to my co2

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.920 
down and do something similar to my co2
adapter<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:50.820> I<00:04:50.940> used<00:04:51.240> for<00:04:53.480> this<00:04:54.480> thing<00:04:54.690> here

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
adapter that I used for this thing here

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.740 
adapter that I used for this thing here
that<00:04:55.110> I<00:04:55.860> showed<00:04:56.130> in<00:04:56.160> another<00:04:56.310> video<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.540> if<00:04:57.630> I

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
that I showed in another video so if I

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.780 
that I showed in another video so if I
can<00:04:57.900> get<00:04:58.080> this<00:04:58.260> type<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.560> thread<00:04:59.040> coming<00:04:59.370> up<00:04:59.580> to

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
can get this type of thread coming up to

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.380 
can get this type of thread coming up to
a<00:04:59.820> tee

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
a tee

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.410 
a tee
and<00:05:00.500> connecting<00:05:01.500> these<00:05:01.650> two<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:02.370> would<00:05:03.240> work

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
and connecting these two it would work

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.780 
and connecting these two it would work
just<00:05:03.480> like<00:05:03.900> that<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.350> then<00:05:05.120> we'll<00:05:06.120> see<00:05:06.300> so

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
just like that and then we'll see so

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.450 
just like that and then we'll see so
