00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.230
 will improve another a second round 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.900
 of wizards at level 7 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 so I have enough but we will make a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.700

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080
 So the market is godmother babas 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.710
 in improvement 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.070
 where it goes very very very very badly 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.070
 and shit 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.170
 it's by twenty anyway we've 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.050
 still the money tower and it's where 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.000
 my shit hero fucking fast wizards 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.190

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.020
 carnage with the wizards as he goes 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.120
 to be almost invincible it's the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.280
 defenders irene do not bother me too much 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.340
 will still be able to take both 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.080
 tanks perfect good ben it's already the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.940
 main 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.230
 yeah super good after the es4 but hey 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.460
 she took both directions there for 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.890
 looking for the other two was when 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.110
 even hot enough especially that it's not 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.690
 a hyper powerful compo 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.010
 in addition yesterday you saw the mass of 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.260
 wizards who had it clan castle 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.970
 I'm not very proud of myself 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.350
 for this attack but hey the booty 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.860
 remains reasonable gold will go into the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:56.330
 base so that's it if you want my 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.810

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.680
 a little bit here was too small point 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.470

 so yes as I told you alone 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.070

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.950

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.920

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.620
 since the last episode 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.560
 so I'm going to put my village from 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.650
 last episode on my ipad and compare 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.750
 so I already know that I've improved 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.990
 new addition to put this because 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.240
 than before I had tesla level 5 and 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.240
 I improved two levels more 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:04.490
 so what is slams access for hdv 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.050
 9 so here and also I improved the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.020
 mortars at the level set because there 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.670
 had a friends pancake still cold the 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.230
 defenses anti reindeer I was all six 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.110
 now jesus mary 2 e set you 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.820
 do not worry it's easy 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.570
 yes good that the articles 3 precisely I 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.620
 had improved them in this episode 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.930
 the Belgian wizard's tricks 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.150
 I train to improve one then the 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.360
 second I 'm going to improve live 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.580
 this is perfect I have more gold the castle 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.420
 of clos also I had that I had 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.690
 not really improved then we have 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.080
 also improved a tower of archers 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.630
 additional because before I 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.430
 had one now I have two yes 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.170
 Here it is 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.360
 so that's it's an easy thing to 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.940
 do it too 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.850
 after also I improved Godmother down the 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.010
 Chanterelle improved on the 8th 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.500
 mauroy frozen level 10 after you 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:05.180
 can see in my profile I have when 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.550
 even 4 4 troupe max brooks which is 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.320
 pretty well so here is my profile if 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:15.140
 you want to see you put on pause 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.360
 that's still 263 and you gain 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.540
 of war win so it's rather not 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.920
 badly that and also never would be bad 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.230
 ramparts 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.100
 in addition to get up quickly because in fact 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.590
 there was the new area 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.600
 farming so bring month we have 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.850
 took advantage of this area and I did when 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.550
 even 60 of ramparts so what was 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.190
 rather not bad 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.380
 so here I hope this episode 4 of 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.450
 the feat towards the age of nine max you 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.910
 will be better circa do not hesitate to like the 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.160

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.880
 to tell me what you think about it and 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
 etc. 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.990
