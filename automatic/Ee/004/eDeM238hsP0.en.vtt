00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.670

 pretty boring franjo is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.979
 racist 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.790
 when we want it 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.520
 and if that does not happen we will 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.240
 very difficult to endure 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.570
 basically we drive a lot 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.880

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.220
 audacity in some kind and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.020
 wise to harass during riding 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.990
 whether he comes too close or even now 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.509
 go in as soon as that happens franjo 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.630
 not about the permanent but he hates 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.079
 the horse and he really hates it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.790
 he becomes the hater she knows her when you 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.070
 somehow their horses very many 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.259
 give nicknames yes you do not write 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.649
 supporting horses in the comments 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.180

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.850
 spasti 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.869
 franjo is hardly afraid of anything 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.810
 from plastic sheeting 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.370
 i think franjo is homosexual 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.739
 no shit he comes with wallachen 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.500
 much better clear than with stages 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.170
 Water would have had you with me 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.269
 we are on the monday tournament but that works 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.860
 unfortunately not from the last week lama 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.410
 and got a drug and that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.360
 is detectable in the blood for nine days so 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.060
 on monday and then not anymore 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.500
 that is very sad but there you can 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.010
 do not do anything then not enough 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.420
 start 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.340
 but you can get up 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.989
 Tuesdays are happy if we are looking forward to it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.100
 because i have considered i am 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.330
 somehow in the tournament fever 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.959
 in there and I had clothes 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.670
 attract 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.560
 I'll introduce you to my tournament 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.730
 Outfits or things that I all do 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.440
 because I have a lot because 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.590
 otherwise , as a duck, this would already be 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.510
 wonderful videos will make you stand up 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.519
 two more video suggestions from me 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.410
 have a go then please down in 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.880
 the infobox look because I have them down 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.319
 I do not have links to merck 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.299
 found out how to do it somehow 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.459
 It always does not matter here 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.620
 Just click this once the full 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.660
 me around from the barn day with franjo and 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.489
 older and that in front of me and ours 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.620
 last tournament I would have me 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.220
 really like to start our next 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.769
 The tournament is right outside 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.530
 an inserted rectangle individually 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.780
 by heart and on a large field the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.190
 gets pretty blatant for a second too 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.950
 I would rather have a third with me 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.630
 but had nothing next window 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.170
 definitely in top form and we 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.170
 prepare us
