makeup this might be for you but I

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.570 
makeup this might be for you but I

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
prefer a more heavy concealer but it

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.420 
prefer a more heavy concealer but it
does<00:05:54.789> feel<00:05:54.820> really<00:05:55.449> nice<00:05:56.160> another<00:05:57.160> thing<00:05:57.400> that

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.250 
does feel really nice another thing that
I<00:05:57.639> notice<00:05:58.000> is<00:05:58.150> I'm<00:05:58.300> not<00:05:58.389> quite<00:05:58.660> sure<00:05:58.690> how<00:05:59.110> long

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
I notice is I'm not quite sure how long

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.379 
I notice is I'm not quite sure how long
this<00:05:59.440> is<00:05:59.500> going<00:05:59.800> to<00:05:59.889> actually<00:06:00.099> last<00:06:00.520> since<00:06:01.240> it

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
this is going to actually last since it

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.450 
this is going to actually last since it
is<00:06:01.570> so<00:06:01.870> creamy<00:06:02.229> I<00:06:02.410> feel<00:06:02.740> like<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:02.979> put<00:06:03.190> quite<00:06:03.400> a

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
is so creamy I feel like I put quite a

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.360 
is so creamy I feel like I put quite a
bit<00:06:03.699> of<00:06:03.880> product<00:06:04.389> just<00:06:04.750> with<00:06:04.960> one<00:06:05.199> use<00:06:05.470> so<00:06:06.070> it's

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
bit of product just with one use so it's

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.219 
bit of product just with one use so it's
kind<00:06:06.520> of<00:06:06.550> like<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.729> twist<00:06:07.060> up<00:06:07.240> stick<00:06:07.599> so<00:06:07.840> I<00:06:07.870> think

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
I could probably throw away but it might

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.129 
I could probably throw away but it might
be<00:06:32.620> keeping<00:06:33.160> this<00:06:33.310> like<00:06:33.580> fresh<00:06:34.030> for<00:06:34.419> longer<00:06:34.479> or

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
like creamy longer and it's like a

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:39.780 
like creamy longer and it's like a
highlighter<00:06:38.229> stick<00:06:38.350> and<00:06:38.889> it<00:06:39.100> is<00:06:39.220> a<00:06:39.430> gorgeous

undertone but it's not too dark it's
still<00:06:45.820> light<00:06:46.300> sometimes<00:06:47.110> I<00:06:47.320> find<00:06:47.590> like

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
still light sometimes I find like

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.279 
still light sometimes I find like
champagne<00:06:48.460> highlighters<00:06:49.030> kind<00:06:49.360> of<00:06:49.479> go<00:06:49.990> more

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
champagne highlighters kind of go more

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:51.930 
champagne highlighters kind of go more
to<00:06:50.470> the<00:06:50.500> gold<00:06:50.860> side<00:06:51.190> and<00:06:51.520> then<00:06:51.610> they're<00:06:51.760> too

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
to the gold side and then they're too

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.120 
to the gold side and then they're too
like<00:06:52.150> dark<00:06:52.510> to<00:06:52.720> highlight<00:06:53.050> with<00:06:53.229> but<00:06:53.710> this<00:06:53.889> is

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
like dark to highlight with but this is

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.159 
like dark to highlight with but this is
really<00:06:54.550> really<00:06:54.850> pretty<00:06:55.030> then<00:06:55.780> you<00:06:55.900> can<00:06:56.020> just

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
really really pretty then you can just

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.140 
really really pretty then you can just
grant<00:06:56.440> up<00:06:56.710> blend<00:06:57.160> it<00:06:57.280> out<00:06:57.400> with<00:06:57.430> your<00:06:57.729> finger

does come with this brush on the end
which<00:07:04.000> I<00:07:04.180> find<00:07:04.510> kind<00:07:04.900> of<00:07:05.080> pointless<00:07:05.410> it's<00:07:06.100> a

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
which I find kind of pointless it's a

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.879 
which I find kind of pointless it's a
little<00:07:06.370> sponge<00:07:07.090> I've<00:07:07.479> tried<00:07:07.690> using<00:07:08.050> it<00:07:08.410> but

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 
little sponge I've tried using it but

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.850 
little sponge I've tried using it but
it's<00:07:09.190> like<00:07:09.310> pretty<00:07:10.090> firm<00:07:10.570> and<00:07:10.960> it's<00:07:11.199> small<00:07:11.590> so

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
it's like pretty firm and it's small so

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.400 
it's like pretty firm and it's small so
it's<00:07:11.979> kind<00:07:12.220> of<00:07:12.280> hard<00:07:12.610> to<00:07:12.789> like<00:07:13.120> blend<00:07:13.539> out<00:07:14.020> with

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
it's kind of hard to like blend out with

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.200 
it's kind of hard to like blend out with
this<00:07:14.590> your<00:07:15.220> finger<00:07:15.520> just<00:07:15.550> works<00:07:16.000> so<00:07:16.120> much
