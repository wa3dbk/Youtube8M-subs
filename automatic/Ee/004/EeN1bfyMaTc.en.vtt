 Good morning, today we are giving one of our 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.259
 works of the light construction company 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.200
 third floor of a residence 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.190
 I'm going to show you one floor here 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.960
 Finishing is already finished. 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.330
 waiting for the frames to arrive here 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.510
 to make the liner 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.640
 we are here on a slab this store 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.710
 It's about 150 square meters. 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 all services performed by 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.440
 The ones we have now have been executed. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.620
 on site 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.829
 we have a porcelanato here on the floor that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 has a woody appearance of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.090

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.469

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.680
