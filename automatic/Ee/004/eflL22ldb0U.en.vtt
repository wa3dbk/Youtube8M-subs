00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello to everyone then as promised here 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.750
 teemix fruit trial so he comes 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.319
 just out of his box I just 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.660
 cleaned 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.210
 the tip I have not tested yet so I 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.540
 will test it live with you i have 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 out of frozen mango that's ten 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.510
 minutes I'm going out because he 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.400
 have to take it out a little bit before and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.080
 and then I cut them into pieces because 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 that you have to cut small pieces 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.599
 for it to fit in there 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.630
 so I'll take the tip and there we 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.960
 goes the vice is simply 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.219
 it is certain that with this I need the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 two hands to be able to get there 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.140
 So here is abuse and he took his place 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.329
 next to the vita knicks and we have the small 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 pestle to drive the little bits of 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 fruit there is just a step button 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.059
 stop it's all nothing simpler 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.219
 and there really is no simpler like 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.370
 machine I think so we'll press 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.370
 the button 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.329
 and here we go ice cream 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.640
 then at the level of the benefits 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.369
 well it's true that it's good because 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.170
 it allows for example 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.450
 yes after that you'll try to agree 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 allows as an invitation to mx one is obliged 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.240
 to put a big quantity there if we 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.640
 wants to make a small amount 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.390
 it's still better in this 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.189
 machine and besides this good bah she is 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.229
 much more compact than the 8 to mix 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.340
 on wood the disadvantages ben voila I 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.140
 just discovered is that it makes 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.209
 a lot of noise it breaks a little 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.739
 ears 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.599
 and then the disadvantage is that we are 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.799
 obliged to cut small bits that 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.810
 with the vita mix we can put 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.610
 directly big ends and also 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.939
 that it is necessary to leave the fruits ten minutes 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.429
 before 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.039
 Here bah we will enjoy then you will 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.230

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.200

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.150
 Well, yes, it's better 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.860
 corner 1 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.540
 I found gluten-free corneas 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.890
 so it's true that it's nice weather 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.120

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.209
 much to a spoon you want a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.079
 spoon to eat it will be better when 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.010

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.410
