the new lightsaber color crystal video
this<00:00:05.100> time<00:00:05.339> I'm<00:00:05.520> working<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:05.879> racks<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.450> prime

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
this time I'm working on racks is prime

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.020 
this time I'm working on racks is prime
this<00:00:07.890> video<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.400> have<00:00:08.550> three

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
this video is going to have three

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.990 
this video is going to have three
crystals<00:00:09.540> instead<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.019> one<00:00:10.639> which<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.820> what<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
crystals instead of one which is what I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.970 
crystals instead of one which is what I
had<00:00:12.210> last<00:00:12.420> time<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:13.380> I'm<00:00:13.530> also<00:00:13.679> going<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
had last time but I'm also going to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.300 
had last time but I'm also going to
throw<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.730> Citro<00:00:15.599> bitch<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.310> nice

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
throw in the Citro bitch is a nice

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.400 
throw in the Citro bitch is a nice
little<00:00:17.580> addition<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.119> check<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.720> out<00:00:18.900> too

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
little addition so check that out too

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.710 
little addition so check that out too
alright<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.760> wait<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> cutscene<00:00:21.600> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
alright just wait for the cutscene you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.050 
alright just wait for the cutscene you
just<00:00:21.960> saw<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.439> grab<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.430> force<00:00:23.640> points<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
just saw and grab the force points to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.910 
just saw and grab the force points to
the<00:00:24.180> left<00:00:24.500> let's<00:00:25.500> hop<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.890> down<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:27.920> I'm

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the left let's hop on down here I'm

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
the left let's hop on down here I'm
gonna<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.310> fight<00:00:29.550> off<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> few<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> these

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
gonna have to fight off a few of these

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.700 
gonna have to fight off a few of these
guys<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.279> color<00:00:32.279> crystal<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:32.910> close

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.970 

let's<00:00:40.430> pop<00:00:40.640> this<00:00:40.820> thing<00:00:40.880> open<00:00:41.240> and<00:00:41.980> there's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
let's pop this thing open and there's

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.830 
let's pop this thing open and there's
your<00:00:43.280> hologram

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.440 

all<00:00:48.650> right<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.860> compressed<00:00:49.400> red<00:00:49.820> light<00:00:50.120> super

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
all right the compressed red light super

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.010 
all right the compressed red light super
crisp

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.020 

now<00:00:53.500> think<00:00:53.770> about<00:00:53.800> compressed<00:00:54.430> you'll<00:00:54.700> notice

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
now think about compressed you'll notice

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.570 
now think about compressed you'll notice
in<00:00:55.210> just<00:00:55.810> a<00:00:55.870> few<00:00:56.020> seconds<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.590> that<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.400> light

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
in just a few seconds is that the light

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.910 
in just a few seconds is that the light
super<00:00:57.880> squiggles<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.660> little<00:00:58.900> bit<00:00:59.080> unstable

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
super squiggles a little bit unstable

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.810 
super squiggles a little bit unstable
does<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:00.550> as<00:01:00.730> well<00:01:01.680> um<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.280> only<00:01:03.430> difference

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
does that as well um the only difference

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.130 
does that as well um the only difference
between<00:01:03.910> compressed<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.570> unstable<00:01:04.930> is

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
between compressed and unstable is

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.730 
between compressed and unstable is
basically<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:07.060> quickly<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.229> squiggles<00:01:08.620> are

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
basically how quickly the squiggles are

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.950 
basically how quickly the squiggles are
going<00:01:11.190> all<00:01:12.190> right<00:01:12.420> after<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.510> cut-scene<00:01:13.690> you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
going all right after the cut-scene you

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.469 
going all right after the cut-scene you
just<00:01:14.170> saw<00:01:14.430> later<00:01:15.430> on<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.850> level<00:01:16.800> you<00:01:17.800> will

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
just saw later on in the level you will

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.080 
just saw later on in the level you will
be<00:01:19.479> one<00:01:20.110> step<00:01:20.290> closer<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.800> your<00:01:21.630> next<00:01:22.630> crystal

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
be one step closer to your next crystal

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.450 
be one step closer to your next crystal
which<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.270> right<00:01:25.570> at<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.840> end<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.290> bridge

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.550 

we<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.090> Gold's<00:01:31.509> like<00:01:31.660> super<00:01:31.990> crystal<00:01:32.350> so

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
we have the Gold's like super crystal so

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.230 
we have the Gold's like super crystal so
let's<00:01:32.770> quit<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.790> make<00:01:36.790> our<00:01:36.910> way<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
let's quit that and make our way to the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.950 
let's quit that and make our way to the
next<00:01:37.390> crystal

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
next crystal

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.249 
next crystal
now<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.470> next<00:01:38.920> crystal<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.580> exact

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
now the next crystal is in the exact

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.430 
now the next crystal is in the exact
well<00:01:41.259> almost<00:01:41.500> exact<00:01:42.220> same<00:01:42.490> room<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:44.020> make<00:01:44.320> our

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
well almost exact same room to make our

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.520 
well almost exact same room to make our
way<00:01:44.560> over<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.740> this<00:01:44.920> wall

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.400 

down<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.340> little<00:01:51.490> elevator

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
down the little elevator

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:00.080 
down the little elevator

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.350 

and<00:02:00.390> let's<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.350> sharper<00:02:02.009> right

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and let's take a sharper right

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.520 
and let's take a sharper right

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
hop on up here have our next holocron

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.430 
hop on up here have our next holocron
side<00:02:07.890> number<00:02:08.100> there<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.630> compressed<00:02:10.050> yellow

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
side number there the compressed yellow

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
side number there the compressed yellow
lightsaber<00:02:10.950> crystal<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.700> let's<00:02:11.850> equip<00:02:12.090> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
lightsaber crystal so let's equip that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.210 
lightsaber crystal so let's equip that
there<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.810> notice<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.890> squiggles<00:02:14.400> and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
there it is notice the squiggles and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.040 
there it is notice the squiggles and
that<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.430> all<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.150> lightsaber<00:02:18.540> crystals

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that is all of the lightsaber crystals

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.540 
that is all of the lightsaber crystals
for<00:02:19.260> racks<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.770> prime<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:21.060> let's<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.550> take

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
for racks is prime so let's go and take

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.770 
for racks is prime so let's go and take
a<00:02:23.610> look<00:02:23.850> at<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.330> Sith<00:02:25.200> robe<00:02:25.470> location

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.630 

okay<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.740> little<00:02:31.070> later<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.460> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
okay this is a little later on in the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.760 
okay this is a little later on in the
level<00:02:32.050> you'll<00:02:33.050> notice<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.770> big<00:02:34.010> silver<00:02:35.770> force

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
level you'll notice the big silver force

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.800 
level you'll notice the big silver force
moving<00:02:37.220> little<00:02:37.520> platform<00:02:38.090> thing<00:02:38.330> behind<00:02:38.660> me

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
moving little platform thing behind me

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.350 
moving little platform thing behind me
once<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:39.920> pass<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.490> will<00:02:40.790> reach<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
once you pass that you will reach the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.690 
once you pass that you will reach the
spot<00:02:41.630> where<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.840> am<00:02:42.110> I'll<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.250> use<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.550> as<00:02:43.670> a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
spot where I am I'll so use that as a
