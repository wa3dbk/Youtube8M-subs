00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.690
 east river grid hit the market in 2008 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.700
 and convinces with this optic one 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.290
 fun multiplayer of the innovative 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.000
 back play functions and made 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.830
 Gameplay technically an interesting 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.830
 splits of simulation and kate 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.050
 now five years later, green 2 seems 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.460
 just like the race driver from the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 has deleted names have 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.529
 cockpit perspective allegedly removed 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 was only five percent of those used but 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.260
 You do not have such similar stories 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 only by codemasters to be good 2 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.250
 predecessor becomes worthy and the game 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.250
 Reinfall is experiencing her in the test 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.300
 the career mode of creed 2 puts 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.430
 no new standards 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.460
 the story is unimportant and unimportant 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.720
 So not really worth the talking 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.270
 Anyway, we still want that relatively 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.580
 unknown race series like it arnold 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.950
 make series racing known 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.010
 but we want to run after that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.890
 bigger and more professional so 4 2 against 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.869
 at the beginning we are relatively unspectacular 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.580
 often stuck the same and 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.880
 the same modes would be better 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.880
 do 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.270
 every time the grip 2 starts 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.310
 starts in our garage 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.560
 Here we can see our current successes 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.690
 watch race management or new cars 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.430
 buy and design 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.410
 the races are in five seasons 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.880
 each of them offers new ones 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.310
 stretches and challenges 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.800
 besides the classic round course would have 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.210
 We are integrating races here 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 the last driver at one 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.200
 then some time will be eliminated 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.570
 then also checkpoint or should 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.460
 challenge in which we have who 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.010
 drive it through checkpoints or drive 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.899
 should have been after each pass in the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.979
 wants to get space fans that is the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.380
 currency in the game 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.630
 the more fans we have the more cars 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.070
 and stretch we turn the free 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.739
 It does not pick a bad one 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.930
 Parents we have just 82 cards 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.450
 We can contest from California 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.760
 to Hongkong and over 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.590
 These are visually absolutely terrific 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 and probably some more from the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.760
 innsbrucker out right 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.250
 the driving physics of greensville 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.490
 the audience is realistic and 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.320
 kate there is no ideal line or 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.940
 other knickknacks but beginners 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.850
 should not race after one or two 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.770
 have more problems with the control 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.540
 also has me a damage model which 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.090
 to the behavior of the cars from 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.090
 So it works down from the gas in the curve 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.210
 So what should one think of g2? 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.980
 just like his predecessor is none 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.870
 we do not have that simulation either 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.630
 expected but something is missing 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.210
 and that's the cockpit perspective who 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.920
 that can get over and that easily there 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.380
 two is relative to the content and 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.240
 fun and powerful gameplay offers 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.240
 the departure of two to heart
