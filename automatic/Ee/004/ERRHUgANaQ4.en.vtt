that's<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.840> attitude<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.470> that's<00:01:11.590> method

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
that's the attitude and that's method

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.760 
that's the attitude and that's method
until<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:12.880> work<00:01:13.119> for<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.540> right

competitor and my biggest opponent so

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.710 
competitor and my biggest opponent so
that's<00:04:09.730> kind<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:09.910> how<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.060> look<00:04:10.300> at<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.510> when<00:04:10.630> it

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
that's kind of how I look at it when it

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.230 
that's kind of how I look at it when it
comes<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:11.020> getting<00:04:11.260> better<00:04:11.350> as<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.590> player<00:04:11.800> I

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.520 
comes to getting better as a player I
would<00:04:13.240> say<00:04:13.390> that<00:04:13.540> those<00:04:13.690> three<00:04:13.900> are<00:04:14.140> already

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
would say that those three are already

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.620
