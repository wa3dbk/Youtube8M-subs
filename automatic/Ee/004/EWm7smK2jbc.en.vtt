completed chicken wire sphere and we're
ready<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.360> wrap<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.110> lights<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.880> have<00:00:14.880> two

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
ready to wrap the lights I have two

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.830 
ready to wrap the lights I have two
strings<00:00:17.420> fifty<00:00:18.420> lights<00:00:18.690> each<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.630> first

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
strings fifty lights each and the first

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.509 
strings fifty lights each and the first
thing<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> want<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.560> before<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.100> wrap<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
thing you want to do before you wrap the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.359 
thing you want to do before you wrap the
ball<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.990> test<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.680> lights<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.220> make

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
ball up is to test the lights and make

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.730 
ball up is to test the lights and make
sure<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:28.519> this<00:00:29.519> one's<00:00:29.820> good

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
sure that this one's good

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.689 
sure that this one's good
and<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.730> one's<00:00:33.030> good<00:00:34.969> right

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
and this one's good right

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.000 
and this one's good right
so<00:00:38.699> usually<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.390> I'll<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.019> I'll<00:00:40.199> begin<00:00:40.440> by

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so usually what I'll do is I'll begin by

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.869 
so usually what I'll do is I'll begin by
finding<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.329> kind<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.809> an<00:00:42.960> open<00:00:43.110> spot<00:00:43.850> where<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
finding a kind of an open spot where I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.509 
finding a kind of an open spot where I
can<00:00:45.210> tie<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:48.390> portion<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> cord<00:00:49.739> in

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
can tie the this portion of the cord in

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.420 
can tie the this portion of the cord in
and<00:00:51.089> get<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:52.220> solid

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and get it solid

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.310 
and get it solid
so<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.479> doesn't<00:00:54.899> slip<00:00:55.290> slide<00:00:57.140> later<00:00:58.140> on

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.070 

and<00:01:02.390> then<00:01:03.390> tie<00:01:04.050> it<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.410> knot<00:01:05.870> that'll<00:01:06.870> keep

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and then tie it in a knot that'll keep

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.890 
and then tie it in a knot that'll keep
it<00:01:07.290> stable<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.550> run<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> extension

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it stable when you run the extension

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.520 
it stable when you run the extension
here<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:11.730> it'll<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.300> good<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.290> just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
here and it'll be good and then you just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.340 
here and it'll be good and then you just
simply<00:01:13.710> start<00:01:13.950> wrapping<00:01:14.870> now<00:01:15.870> there's<00:01:16.110> two

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
simply start wrapping now there's two

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.950 
simply start wrapping now there's two
schools<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.950> thought<00:01:19.040> my<00:01:20.040> neighbor<00:01:20.780> next<00:01:21.780> door

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
schools of thought my neighbor next door

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.340 
schools of thought my neighbor next door
Linda<00:01:22.590> makes<00:01:22.800> some<00:01:23.070> excellent<00:01:23.690> balls<00:01:24.690> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
Linda makes some excellent balls and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
Linda makes some excellent balls and
they're<00:01:26.100> perfect<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.000> she<00:01:27.479> places<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:29.570> bulbs

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
they're perfect and she places the bulbs

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
they're perfect and she places the bulbs
all<00:01:30.840> inside<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.630> sphere<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.460> gives<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
all inside the sphere and it gives it a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.920 
all inside the sphere and it gives it a
much<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.350> uniform<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.190> clean<00:01:38.670> look<00:01:39.030> or
