 less than Mr. Rubén omar Roman 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.420
 who comes to the baton of being able to direct 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.450

 later fight for the championship

 from the opening to 2015 with the team 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.949
 los xolos de tijuana 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.880
 to start the mission 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.300
 a very big illusion of reaching this 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.110
 institution 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.070
 because we found in the talks so much 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 with jorge as with lazio 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 it's a good chemistry a good 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.510
 vision of what we look for what 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.170
 we want 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.079
 they as leaders analyzed the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.469
 technicians who pretend and one like 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.140
 technician analyzes the directive that can 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.270
 get one so you can with the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.270
 tools that they have come to look for 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.970
 the objectives that one has planned and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.090
 within those is a directive to which 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.789
 I was in my mind for the youth 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.289
 for the work for the projects 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.860
 who have the vision for what they have 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:28.399
 grown lately and they will give me the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.590
 tools to find the only 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.500
 title of course there are steps 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.600
 we must first strengthen what is 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.100
 is doing well to strengthen it with 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.590
 some positions that we need but 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.890
 I work more than anything a lot of work to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.149
 which will give a lot of intensity 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.250
 and the honesty of my whole body 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.950
 technical yes of course we're going to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.709
 analyze well what was the great reason for 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.090
 that crashing fall in the past 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.770
 seven matches 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.179
 but you also have to keep in mind that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.039
 he was one of the teams more goals more 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.399
 scorers if we're going to look for a 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.439
 balance let's try to look for the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.060
 suitable people to reinforce a little the 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.040
 back and look for some forward 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.650
 more but the idea is to be a team 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.959
 aggressive a team that is not done 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.459
 only strong local thinking that 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.680
 it's always an advantage for the 1 like 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.610
 visitor who came to play the court is 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.170
 a minimal advantage but it is an advantage 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.569
 look for the equipment to be equal to both 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.980
 local as a visitor seek to play 20 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.930
 30 meters or more in advance what 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.849
 he came playing normally and for that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.349
 we have to find the best games 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.610
 let's make an aggressive team not 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.209
 have doubts about both local and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.970
 visitor so I'm here with no place to 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.810
 I just said it a while ago in a list 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.790
 also where can go there were some offers 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.920
 that I did not take them into account because I'm 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.860
 waiting for the right team to search 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.049
 what any institution wants but 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.340
 apart what admits level I need that 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.760
 it's a title 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.890
 I think this brings this team all 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.319
 the conditions to be able to do it 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.959
 and ambitious 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.379
 as ambitious it is going to be my team within 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.670
 of the field follows the message that 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.540
 we need unconditional support as 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.150
 always this team has had it but the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.069
 message is that you will find a computer 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.709
 delivered fighting each ball as if 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.959
 out last and looking for the equipment 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.790
 will be aggressive aggressive in the sense of 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.500
 the wind of the word to fetch 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.180
 the opposite arch 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.270
 with the balance we were talking about 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.060
 but with a team that recovers fleet 20 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.340
 or 30 meters later 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.530
 in this way the technician rubén 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.760
 Roman omar faces a new stage that 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.560
 will be with the team of xolos de 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.290
 tijuana where he mentioned that he feels 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.690
 happy comfortable and very happy to be able 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.530
 be directing a team as it is 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.840
 the tijuana club team 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.599
 hot xoloitzcuintles let's see 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.940

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.890
