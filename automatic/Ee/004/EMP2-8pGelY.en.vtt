00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.940
 Hello today I want to show you how 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.610
 it is quite easy to clean the whole window 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.489
 fast strip-free everything we need 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.090
 need is a bowl with lukewarm 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:20.570
 water and a microfiber cloth specially 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.680
 For windows these microfiber cloths are 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.090

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.500
 be from different companies 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.170
 meanwhile in almost every business 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.019

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:42.319

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.569

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:48.440

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:53.989

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.670

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.670
 get started with the cleanse 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.750
 Here you can see my patio door 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:11.560
 and I can start 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.560

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.960

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:42.820
