up<00:02:28.220> all<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.489> trash<00:02:28.700> was<00:02:29.000> chirping<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
up all the trash was chirping and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.699 
up all the trash was chirping and
chattering<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:30.080> check<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.380> thing<00:02:30.440> doesn't

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
chattering in check this thing doesn't

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.550 
chattering in check this thing doesn't
trip<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.160> shatter<00:02:31.310> over<00:02:31.640> all<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.880> junk

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
trip and shatter over all this junk

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.990 
trip and shatter over all this junk
believe<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:33.709> not<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.040> only<00:02:34.130> come<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:34.910> it

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
believe it or not it only come up if it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.190 
believe it or not it only come up if it
has<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.120> good<00:02:35.209> signal<00:02:35.600> even<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:35.930> large

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
has a good signal even with this large

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.660 
has a good signal even with this large
coil<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:39.680> goes<00:02:39.800> guys<00:02:39.980> another<00:02:40.220> short<00:02:40.489> dig

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
coil so it goes guys another short dig

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.960 
coil so it goes guys another short dig
with<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.620> white<00:02:42.620> seagull<00:02:42.950> spectrum<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.850> get

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
with the white seagull spectrum and get

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.970 
with the white seagull spectrum and get
there<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.330> Sun<00:02:44.570> just<00:02:45.290> if<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.530> guys<00:02:45.620> ever<00:02:45.799> seen

replacements or rechargeables yeah these
were<00:03:08.239> made<00:03:08.390> in<00:03:08.420> 92<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.260> they're<00:03:09.890> supposed<00:03:10.070> to

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
were made in 92 and they're supposed to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.979 
were made in 92 and they're supposed to
go<00:03:10.370> pretty<00:03:10.549> deep<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.060> they<00:03:11.330> do<00:03:11.390> go<00:03:11.750> pretty
