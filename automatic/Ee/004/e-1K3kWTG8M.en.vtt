00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.130
 Let's talk about how to disguise 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.509
 gang 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.429
 The other time I said how to disguise 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.809
 I can leave the link here. 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.869
 in enrollment for those who did not attend 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.760
 watch and today let's talk about hips 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.519
 more advanced there are people who 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.090
 likes to leave the shape of the body well 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.580
 marked and there for that purpose the pieces 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.099
 most suitable are the most wraps 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 fair but the thigh for who wants to force 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.880
 even for those who do not like it do not 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.559
 feel fine with just clothes I think the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 framework is very disproportionate each 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.110
 your neura is not right 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.030
 There are also many people with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 relation to this even in the day-to-day 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 known is suddenly to the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.100
 Job talk, I do not like to show 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.980
 my godfather because it's the place of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 work and people look too hot 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.739
 good attention whatever your 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.960
 goal 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.480
 I'll teach you how quickly three tips 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.760
 how to strengthen for those who are starting 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.309
 and do not understand much of proportions everything 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.270
 which marks evidently and everything 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.479
 What is bigger than everything that does not mark 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.799
 disguise 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.630
 I even did a drawing here of a 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.210
 dont notice that it's too much 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 it 's just to give you an idea of ​​the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.070
 so seeing that is now the fifth 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 big picture on the shoulders 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.040
 body guitar is normal for woman 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 Usually Brazilian Brazilians 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.869
 enter the body like that and let's say 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.299
 that she does not want to show this 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.420
 so she has to be there to work and she 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.150
 wants a outfit that makes the model come out 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.450
 and do what is here the model in 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.729
 abnormally that image that does so 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.549
 this ideal model to disguise you 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.399
 Let's say let's say it was 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.409
 a high waist and medium height skirt 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.960
 You see she disguises very well. 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.509
 Why does she follow the body line? 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.390
 and it does not then mark when it does not 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.710
 proportion gets more disguised understood 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 You can not really realize that she has a 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.750
 wide picture because what is to pass is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.940
 missing the first piece you jari 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.369
 they left is a model 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.100
 is that there were already two seasons ago 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.140
 now she is not on the podium anymore 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.690
 of major bets but still continues 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.110
 You can use one for a summer as soon as 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.660
 this here 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.180
 he was very well but so she has 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.900
 this drawing she did not come to do but she 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.820
 has this design that follows the hip without 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.820
 adjust them to fit it then 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.270
 she disguises well she moaned shortly 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.340
 avatar mid thigh but it's her respect 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.170
 to hygiene and I stayed in the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.460
 another legal skirt model that is already 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.230
 very high 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.090
 is the model told me he will not go to 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.020
 see such an ending but I'll show you a piece 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.020
 It's for you to have an idea. 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.890
 Look, she is fulfilled. She goes to the 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.620
 mid-calf and she larguinha this 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.030
 thought model is great because he besides 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.670
 to fit very well to the body 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.120
 independent gift of the size of clothing 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.990
 You use it, it's comfortable and it disguises. 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.280
 superb dark models and force well 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.030
 more than schools 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.200
 so here to the waist is she she 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.420
 of the one modeled in the same waist and she 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.010
 It's opening, so it's a little model. 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.930
 It's really cool for you to invest if you 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.030
 you have none at least invest in a 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.150
 Why does she look good with a boot? 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.620
 sandal with scarpin to well versatile well 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
 more versatile than you think and it is not 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.850
 because she, for example, from the grocery store 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.500
 floral cinny and just for my romantic 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.210
 that you necessarily need 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.550
 dress the doll not necessarily 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.160
 You can combine I do not know with a 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.470
 band suddenly one by the middle roger one 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.750
 culture boot is not going to what you want 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.340
 and it has also invested that they know that 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.380
 the price of style also satisfies the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.690
 hips more aguenta jorginho that follows 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.220
 this modeling also make the most 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.650
 not necessarily they 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.959
 need to have an up-to-date format but the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 more solitudes that do not stop 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.880
 they are just as sleep does not fit 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.860
 hip they serve this purpose 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.290
 I got one here too, which is more or 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.060
 except for this line that I said it is not 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.730
 necessarily we only had him 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.750
 strap on waist 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.690
 so it was a pity and the way out 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.760
 from ronaldinho also posted 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.680
 he is not very long he goes more or 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.710
 less voted on the knee maybe a little 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.020
 a little above the knee and he also gives 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.430
 disguise effect 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.669
 he is great and fun because he 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.830
 and he has this area before 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.600
 have been seem to pronounce me line 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.270
 so it looks great for more events 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.410
 sophisticated day-to-day 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.010
 a shoe a bag but glued and he 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.650
 also well, so they are pieces that 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.450
 go well with all types of body but 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.940
 mainly help those who want to 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.250
 disguise large hips because 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.950
 usually the skinny want to look like 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.650
 more full-bodied 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.330
 no one is satisfied then these 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.310
 even though they are parts that are 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.810
 well any body type is more 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.150
 indicated for those with wide hips 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.490
 because they disguise that region 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.740
 they do so because this breadth 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.950
 she gives the bar is that this modeling 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.020
 gives an end of the hounds only of hip 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.360
 anyway it 's the right thing for you 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.950
 bet on bonn is these were the tips 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.460

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.380

 do not know is an ebook that dedicates its well 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.740
 so of proportion there gives with more emphasis 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.630
 much more detail not necessarily 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.940
 for you a personal stylist no

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.190
 color ratios 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.340
 So who wants to know the 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.260
 matter is a nice investment that 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.240
