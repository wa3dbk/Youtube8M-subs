person<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.220> little<00:00:35.370> bit<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.610> problem

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
person have a little bit of a problem

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.760 
person have a little bit of a problem
with<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.390> device<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:37.020> terms<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> its<00:00:37.500> weight

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
with this device in terms of its weight

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.900 
with this device in terms of its weight
I<00:00:38.160> mean<00:00:38.880> that<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.500> kilo<00:00:40.980> one

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I mean that is about one kilo one

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
I mean that is about one kilo one
kilogram<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.660> weight<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.080> you<00:00:43.380> really<00:00:43.680> cannot

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
kilogram in weight and you really cannot

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.240 
kilogram in weight and you really cannot
hold<00:00:44.310> that<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.730> hand<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.010> two<00:00:47.190> or

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
hold that in one hand you know two or

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.010 
hold that in one hand you know two or
three<00:00:47.430> times<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.790> weight<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.150> book<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
three times the weight of a book is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.170 
three times the weight of a book is
really<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.520> useful<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:52.700> and<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.880> fact

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
really not that useful but and the fact

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.550 
really not that useful but and the fact
that<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.450> have<00:00:54.630> to<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:55.110> types<00:00:55.380> of

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
that you have to have two types of

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.140 
that you have to have two types of
screen<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.330> two<00:00:57.510> types<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.930> content<00:00:59.150> when

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
screen to have two types of content when

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150 
screen to have two types of content when
you've<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.450> stuff<00:01:00.720> like<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.410> picture<00:01:01.710> cheap

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
you've got stuff like the picture cheap

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.090 
you've got stuff like the picture cheap
screens<00:01:02.640> coming<00:01:02.880> up<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.930> kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.290> defeats

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
screens coming up really kind of defeats

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
screens coming up really kind of defeats
the object<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:06.150> me<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> dual<00:01:06.689> screen

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the object for me on a dual screen

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
the object for me on a dual screen
reader<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.409> anyway<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.550> get<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.730> idea<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
reader but anyway you get the idea of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
reader but anyway you get the idea of
how<00:01:09.840> thick<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> device<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.250> each<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
how thick the device can be so each of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.080 
how thick the device can be so each of
those<00:01:11.760> sides<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:13.110> basically<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:14.090> PC

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
those sides actually is basically a PC

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.160 
those sides actually is basically a PC
well

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
well

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.920 
well
let's<00:01:17.799> say<00:01:17.979> some<00:01:18.280> sort<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.549> system<00:01:19.420> running<00:01:19.840> on

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
let's say some sort of system running on

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.679 
let's say some sort of system running on
an<00:01:19.990> ARM<00:01:20.170> processor<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.939> if<00:01:22.030> at<00:01:22.180> one<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.600> these

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
an ARM processor so if at one of these

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.719 
an ARM processor so if at one of these
sides<00:01:23.049> if<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.439> took<00:01:23.590> this<00:01:23.799> side<00:01:24.100> just<00:01:24.310> running

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
sides if you took this side just running

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.320 
sides if you took this side just running
on<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.060> fridge<00:01:25.630> guard<00:01:25.869> on<00:01:25.990> if<00:01:26.080> it's<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.320> mx5<00:01:26.860> but

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
on the fridge guard on if it's I mx5 but

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.800 
on the fridge guard on if it's I mx5 but
it's<00:01:28.330> fairly<00:01:28.570> thin<00:01:29.049> that's<00:01:29.890> how<00:01:30.189> thick<00:01:30.520> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it's fairly thin that's how thick a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350 
it's fairly thin that's how thick a
tablet-style<00:01:32.009> android<00:01:33.009> device<00:01:33.310> could<00:01:33.670> be<00:01:33.940> if

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
tablet-style android device could be if

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.270 
tablet-style android device could be if
you<00:01:34.479> kind<00:01:34.630> of<00:01:34.780> ignore<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.289> ePaper<00:01:35.619> side<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.159> it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
you kind of ignore the ePaper side of it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.969 
you kind of ignore the ePaper side of it
so<00:01:37.149> it's<00:01:37.299> pretty<00:01:37.420> interesting<00:01:37.899> looks<00:01:38.590> looks

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
so it's pretty interesting looks looks

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.639 
so it's pretty interesting looks looks
quite<00:01:39.190> nice<00:01:39.340> nicely<00:01:39.789> finished<00:01:40.140> buttons<00:01:41.140> as<00:01:41.590> a

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
quite nice nicely finished buttons as a

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.730 
quite nice nicely finished buttons as a
nice<00:01:43.200> pointer<00:01:44.200> here<00:01:44.729> scroll<00:01:45.729> pointer<00:01:46.210> webcam

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
nice pointer here scroll pointer webcam

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.440 
nice pointer here scroll pointer webcam
and<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:48.100> course<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.460> usual<00:01:48.490> buttons<00:01:49.090> for<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
and of course the usual buttons for the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.430 
and of course the usual buttons for the
e-reader<00:01:50.050> side<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.530> things<00:01:50.819> micro<00:01:51.819> USB

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
e-reader side of things micro USB

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.529 
e-reader side of things micro USB
there's<00:01:53.440> SD<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:54.250> I<00:01:54.399> guess<00:01:54.940> it's<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.179> micro<00:01:55.509> SD

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
there's SD and I guess it's a micro SD

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.570 
there's SD and I guess it's a micro SD
card<00:01:56.080> slot<00:01:56.170> as<00:01:56.440> well<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:59.649> sure<00:01:59.890> there's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
card slot as well and I'm sure there's

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.620 
card slot as well and I'm sure there's
some<00:02:00.789> USB<00:02:01.659> slots<00:02:02.049> on<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.229> side<00:02:02.970> power<00:02:03.970> and

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
some USB slots on the side power and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.309 
some USB slots on the side power and
that's<00:02:04.990> about<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:07.060> interesting<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.720> concept

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
that's about it so interesting a concept

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.910 
that's about it so interesting a concept
but<00:02:08.530> as<00:02:08.890> far<00:02:09.130> as<00:02:09.190> I'm<00:02:09.399> concerned<00:02:10.920> something

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
but as far as I'm concerned something

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.830 
but as far as I'm concerned something
that<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.250> fits<00:02:12.519> in<00:02:12.790> while<00:02:13.510> we're<00:02:13.720> waiting

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
that just fits in while we're waiting

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.620
