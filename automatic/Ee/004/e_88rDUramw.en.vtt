00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.440 
this out of my way I go to the brush let
me<00:03:13.540> make<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:13.989> brush<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.350> little<00:03:14.530> smaller<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:16.420> I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
me make this brush a little smaller so I

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.750 
me make this brush a little smaller so I
can<00:03:16.480> like<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:17.050> what<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.230> hell<00:03:17.350> I'm<00:03:17.440> doing<00:03:17.760> all

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
can like see what the hell I'm doing all

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.199 
can like see what the hell I'm doing all
right<00:03:19.019> click<00:03:20.019> on<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.739> then<00:03:21.640> we<00:03:21.760> go<00:03:21.940> up

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
right click on this and then we go up

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.540 
right click on this and then we go up
here<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.690> our<00:03:22.720> gear<00:03:24.180> load<00:03:25.180> brushes<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:29.459> see<00:03:30.459> if

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
here to our gear load brushes and see if

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.130 
here to our gear load brushes and see if
I<00:03:30.640> can<00:03:30.790> figure<00:03:30.940> out<00:03:31.030> where<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.330> went

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.070 

so<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.880> preset<00:03:36.880> isn't<00:03:37.239> going<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.450> show<00:03:37.480> up<00:03:37.690> in

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
so the preset isn't going to show up in

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.580 
so the preset isn't going to show up in
our<00:03:38.760> manager<00:03:39.760> or<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.450> our<00:03:40.630> drop-down<00:03:41.290> menu

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
our manager or in our drop-down menu

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.040 
our manager or in our drop-down menu
because<00:03:41.980> we<00:03:42.550> need<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.850> restart<00:03:43.269> Photoshop<00:03:43.510> so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
because we need to restart Photoshop so

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.280 
because we need to restart Photoshop so
let's<00:03:44.380> do<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:45.810> I'm<00:03:46.810> going<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:49.290> run

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
let's do that and I'm going to run

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.140 
let's do that and I'm going to run
Photoshop<00:03:50.860> here<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.280> run<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.030> as<00:03:52.120> administrator

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
Photoshop here I run it as administrator

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.140 
Photoshop here I run it as administrator
so<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:52.959> can<00:03:53.140> save<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.560> certain<00:03:53.829> areas<00:03:54.150> sometimes

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
so I can save to certain areas sometimes

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.120 
so I can save to certain areas sometimes
I<00:03:55.480> get<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:57.390> not<00:03:58.390> available<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.590> save<00:03:59.799> in<00:04:00.010> this

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
I get the not available to save in this

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.530 
I get the not available to save in this
area<00:04:00.489> kind<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.820> stupid<00:04:01.150> thing
