00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.679
 there are very good everyone I'm fury we're going to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.029
 see this little guide of everything that 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.970
 you have to know everything I know about 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.919
 moment about this giant the hillbilly 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.680
 the big guy what you want to call 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.090
 ok to access it you have to upload 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.760
 with the stairs that are a just to 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.779
 where the first box comes from 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.870
 jump to the building opposite and 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.390
 strain through the hole because to 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.550
 be able to access this site and here 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.320
 we will find the hanging key is worth more 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.180
 go ahead then you will see I have put a 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.680
 small clip of this key so that the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.289
 see since in the cinema mode you could not see 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.730
 and now we open and take here a 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.620
 bottle that is also not seen is a bottle 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.250
 as you see below in the icon with three x 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.710
 a bottle of alcohol and by giving it 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.690
 What it will do is that the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.160
 turn and break the debris that 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.050
 find in this way we can 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.390
 release several debris that there are the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.280
 different points of the map to access 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.009
 to new areas it was before 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.509
 impossible to access them as per 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.850
 example to be able to open the door to be able 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.250
 enter without having to go around or 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.979
 especially to enter the mansion 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.270
 background where we have the witch house in 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.040
 the trailer we saw a witch but in 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.140
 reality 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.560
 are several witches that we'll see later 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.820
 in an upcoming video as I said this 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 it's the pint that has the key one 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.950
 skull so green sophie and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.830
 nothing you catch the key is here and just 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.350
 in front of the cell open you give him the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.590
 alcohol and alcohol will do this that breaks 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.270
 the rubble another function that it has is 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 as we also saw in the trailer this 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.030
 sweet dish then here the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.190
 we collect and when a character has 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.350
 this dish all the time we the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.509
 big guy will come and tell us 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.880
 give me give me not then when we give it to him 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.820
 will enter fury mode will not stay 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.000
 totally in rabid mode and what 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.860
 important about all this is that the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 giant will not continue there where 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.350
 we go in the follow and go 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.820
 hitting kicks punching go devastating 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.040
 with all the zombies that are 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.520
 in its wake although a camera has been left 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.860
 in 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.450
 in this in free mode for you to see 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.120
 how is killing the zombies since in 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.300
 first person could not see very well 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.760
 and the truth is that it goes quite well but what 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.740
 more important is not the issue of 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.800
 candy to kill the zombies since 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.150
 we have not given much use of the moment 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.760
 but the most important thing as I say is 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.030
 the issue of giving him alcohol so that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.770
 go breaking these debris if not 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.090
 I'm wrong I hope I 'm not mistaken when 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.610
 we pick up a bottle of alcohol 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.920
 It costs us a thousand points to catch 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.260
 this object to be able to say hello and now 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.900
 here we are at the bottom of the map in this 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.310
 witch house we have given him alcohol 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.130
 so that we can break these 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.620
 debris to access has to 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.750
 be the giant on his back and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.120
 us pointing to let's say towards the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.520
 debris that he wants to break since he 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.390
 when giving him the bottle of alcohol he will turn 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.010
 and raze that will go in a straight line and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.930
 devastated with what I caught not then is 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.030
 better that the debris is right 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.130
 Behind him before giving him alcohol 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.630
 that is well positioned so you can 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.730
 open the door 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.840
 and finally, out of curiosity, we have 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.250
 put the opposite if we shoot him with 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.590
 the rai bulnes we were with the rai 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.090
 bombs 2 we shot you 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.580
 immediately it has gone running 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.100
 fled and has been closed again in the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.260
 cell where I was because that has been all 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.360
 for now I hope you liked it and 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.540
 see you in the next video until the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.540
 next 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.170
 no no
