00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.789 
can see that there's very not much
bulkier<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.690> nice<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.109> flexible<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
bulkier it's nice and flexible and the

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.229 
bulkier it's nice and flexible and the
way<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.129> shape<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.579> actual<00:02:56.940> padding

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
way the shape of the actual padding

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.210 
way the shape of the actual padding
itself<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.930> very<00:02:58.200> form-fitting<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.950> your<00:02:59.069> leg

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
itself is very form-fitting to your leg

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.250 
itself is very form-fitting to your leg
so<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.670> said<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.480> nice<00:03:00.659> and<00:03:00.900> closely

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
so like I said if it's nice and closely

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.259 
so like I said if it's nice and closely
and<00:03:01.680> provides<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.250> much<00:03:02.400> extra<00:03:02.819> protection

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
and provides so much extra protection

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.240 
and provides so much extra protection
that<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> wouldn't<00:03:03.840> normally<00:03:04.019> have<00:03:04.319> with

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
that you wouldn't normally have with

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.460 
that you wouldn't normally have with
basically<00:03:06.030> wearing<00:03:06.389> your<00:03:06.510> standard<00:03:06.900> sock<00:03:07.200> and

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
basically wearing your standard sock and

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.229 
basically wearing your standard sock and
like<00:03:07.889> I<00:03:07.980> said<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.250> adds<00:03:08.400> pretty<00:03:08.730> much<00:03:08.849> no<00:03:09.000> extra

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
like I said it adds pretty much no extra

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.399 
like I said it adds pretty much no extra
bulk<00:03:09.389> but<00:03:09.599> you'll<00:03:09.750> see<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> little<00:03:10.049> bit<00:03:10.230> later

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
bulk but you'll see a little bit later

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.890 
bulk but you'll see a little bit later
on<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.700> product<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.180> my<00:03:12.450> leg<00:03:12.689> and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
on when the product is on my leg and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.089 
on when the product is on my leg and
then<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.379> course<00:03:13.409> you<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.799> your<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.980> little

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
then of course you have your a little

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.970 
then of course you have your a little
bit<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.579> elasticated<00:03:15.450> foot<00:03:15.870> holder<00:03:16.620> here<00:03:16.829> on

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
bit of a elasticated foot holder here on

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.229 
bit of a elasticated foot holder here on
the<00:03:17.069> bottom<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.430> believe<00:03:17.639> this<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.790> called<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
the bottom I believe this is called a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.180 
the bottom I believe this is called a
stirrup<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.810> that's<00:03:19.410> gonna<00:03:19.590> hold<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.010> whole

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
stirrup and that's gonna hold the whole

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.960 
stirrup and that's gonna hold the whole
thing<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.519> place

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
thing in place

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.020 
thing in place
but<00:03:21.299> it's<00:03:21.419> kind<00:03:21.569> of<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.750> slightly<00:03:22.319> compression

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
but it's kind of a slightly compression

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.879 
but it's kind of a slightly compression
type<00:03:24.030> sleeve<00:03:24.690> itself<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.739> this

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
any issues with it going on but that's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.309 
any issues with it going on but that's
pretty<00:04:12.239> much<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:12.629> as<00:04:12.840> simple<00:04:13.019> as<00:04:13.260> that

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319

work<00:05:43.409> with<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.710> shin<00:05:43.860> guard<00:05:44.009> and<00:05:44.099> how<00:05:44.159> it

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
work with the shin guard and how it

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.769 
work with the shin guard and how it
actually<00:05:44.310> looks<00:05:44.580> like<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.389> said<00:05:45.569> it<00:05:45.659> does<00:05:45.750> a

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:45.779 
actually looks like I said it does a

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.179 
actually looks like I said it does a
really<00:05:45.870> good<00:05:46.169> job<00:05:46.349> of<00:05:46.409> holding<00:05:46.740> your<00:05:47.039> shin

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
really good job of holding your shin

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.129 
really good job of holding your shin
guard<00:05:47.370> in<00:05:47.460> place<00:05:47.669> without<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.599> need<00:05:48.750> for<00:05:48.779> tape

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
guard in place without the need for tape

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.619 
guard in place without the need for tape
which<00:05:49.710> normally<00:05:50.099> is<00:05:50.219> what's<00:05:50.879> required<00:05:51.210> to

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
which normally is what's required to

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.959 
which normally is what's required to
keep<00:05:51.779> these<00:05:52.020> types<00:05:52.289> of<00:05:52.379> shin<00:05:52.529> guards<00:05:52.830> up<00:05:52.979> like

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
keep these types of shin guards up like

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.399 
keep these types of shin guards up like
I<00:05:54.060> said<00:05:54.210> it<00:05:54.330> fits<00:05:54.509> pretty<00:05:54.659> much<00:05:54.870> any<00:05:55.080> shaped

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
I said it fits pretty much any shaped

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.079 
I said it fits pretty much any shaped
shin<00:05:55.649> guard<00:05:55.860> because<00:05:56.399> of<00:05:56.490> how<00:05:56.580> stretchy<00:05:56.849> that

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.089 
shin guard because of how stretchy that

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.730 
shin guard because of how stretchy that
spot<00:05:57.270> material<00:05:57.659> is<00:05:57.779> and<00:05:57.990> does<00:05:58.319> a<00:05:58.349> really<00:05:58.529> good

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
spot material is and does a really good

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.260 
spot material is and does a really good
job<00:05:58.860> of<00:05:58.919> keeping<00:05:59.129> it<00:05:59.339> in<00:05:59.430> place<00:05:59.639> so<00:05:59.849> you<00:06:00.149> can

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
job of keeping it in place so you can

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.339 
job of keeping it in place so you can
see<00:06:00.389> I<00:06:00.419> have<00:06:00.629> pretty<00:06:00.839> much<00:06:00.930> everything

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
see I have pretty much everything

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.139 
see I have pretty much everything
incorporated<00:06:01.680> here<00:06:02.159> obviously<00:06:02.879> the<00:06:02.969> last

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.149 
incorporated here obviously the last

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.119 
incorporated here obviously the last
thing<00:06:03.389> to<00:06:03.509> do<00:06:03.629> is<00:06:03.779> put<00:06:03.930> these<00:06:04.050> endo<00:06:04.349> socks<00:06:04.649> but

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
thing to do is put these endo socks but

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:06.170 
thing to do is put these endo socks but

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:07.529 
even necessarily need to wear these

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:08.360 
even necessarily need to wear these
under<00:06:07.710> socks

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
under socks

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.679 
under socks
