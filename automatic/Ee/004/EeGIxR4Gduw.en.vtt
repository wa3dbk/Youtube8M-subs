include a number of other factors as

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.699 
include a number of other factors as
well<00:03:27.810> not<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.560> human<00:03:29.459> travel<00:03:29.730> patterns<00:03:30.709> one

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
well not just human travel patterns one

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.039 
well not just human travel patterns one
of<00:03:31.859> these<00:03:32.010> factors<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.150> speed<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.750> which<00:03:33.780> a

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
of these factors is the speed at which a

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.569 
of these factors is the speed at which a

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
virus can be transmitted another is how

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.160 
virus can be transmitted another is how
long<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:39.030> takes<00:03:39.299> for<00:03:39.569> symptoms<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.200> appear

long it takes for symptoms to appear

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.349 
long it takes for symptoms to appear
yeah<00:03:43.170> well<00:03:43.889> we<00:03:44.220> intend<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.639> concentrate<00:03:45.329> on

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
yeah well we intend to concentrate on

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.330 
yeah well we intend to concentrate on
what<00:03:45.630> applies<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.260> many<00:03:46.440> different<00:03:46.650> viruses

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
what applies to many different viruses

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.250 
what applies to many different viruses
if<00:03:47.910> we<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.329> come<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:48.810> some<00:03:49.019> widely

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
if we can come up with some widely

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.559 
if we can come up with some widely
applicable<00:03:49.680> conclusions<00:03:50.519> we<00:03:51.030> may<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.209> able<00:03:51.419> to

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
applicable conclusions we may be able to

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.180 
applicable conclusions we may be able to
use<00:03:51.660> them<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.200> develop<00:03:52.349> widely<00:03:52.980> applicable

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
use them to develop widely applicable

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.580 
use them to develop widely applicable
preventive<00:03:54.090> measures<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.750> that's<00:03:55.319> basically

preventive measures and that's basically

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.460 
preventive measures and that's basically

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
what our goal is one does for them
