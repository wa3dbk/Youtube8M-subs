this one has way more movement to it a

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.190 
this one has way more movement to it a
lot<00:03:04.750> more<00:03:04.890> articulation<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.900> move<00:03:08.050> the

little bit side to side you can move the
chest<00:03:16.600> as<00:03:16.930> well<00:03:17.260> as<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.590> waist<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:19.570> can<00:03:19.810> move

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
chest as well as the waist you can move

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.320 
chest as well as the waist you can move
the<00:03:21.580> upper<00:03:21.970> shoulder<00:03:22.440> up<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.800> down<00:03:23.980> up<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.520> up

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
the upper shoulder up and down up and up

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.150 
the upper shoulder up and down up and up
and<00:03:25.630> down<00:03:26.610> side<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.670> side<00:03:28.739> again<00:03:29.739> with<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
and down side to side again with the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.770 
and down side to side again with the
upper<00:03:31.030> elbow<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.850> one<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.209> have<00:03:34.390> two

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
upper elbow and this one you have two

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.340 
upper elbow and this one you have two
points<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:36.090> movement<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.480> elbow<00:03:37.810> one<00:03:38.050> here

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
points of movement on the elbow one here

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.580 
points of movement on the elbow one here
and<00:03:38.470> one<00:03:38.530> here<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.370> can<00:03:39.640> make<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.320> Bend<00:03:41.320> a

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
and one here so you can make it Bend a

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.300 
and one here so you can make it Bend a
lot<00:03:41.830> more<00:03:42.070> realistic

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.310
