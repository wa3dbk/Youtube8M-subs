 significant day of April 3, 2014 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.890
 Significant to the fact that we came to nature 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.930

 decided to film this case of articles not so we 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.180
 far from the city over there are high-rise buildings already 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.660
 and even here is very close 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.219
 as I said, we live on the outskirts 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.219

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.230

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.719

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.539
 we are the sea ​​on the other side but its not from here 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:09.380

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.220
 we make cuts in several places 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.220
 that's so desirable to the bone 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.640
 But it must be sharp to good 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.640

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.630

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.890
 but as usual nobody took the skewer 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.920
 a lattice too therefore as always 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.580
 improvised skewers you just 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.580

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.750

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:28.079

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.860
 tentatively as I said we cut 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.220

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.220
