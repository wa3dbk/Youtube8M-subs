now<00:04:17.359> depending<00:04:17.750> on<00:04:18.139> how<00:04:18.320> much<00:04:18.500> hydrogen

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
now depending on how much hydrogen

peroxide and east you added a fountain

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.370 
peroxide and east you added a fountain
could<00:04:22.250> get<00:04:22.430> bigger<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:23.000> sort<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.660> explode<00:04:24.139> out

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
could get bigger and sort of explode out

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:40.620 
could get bigger and sort of explode out
and<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:30.500> see<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:30.919> still<00:04:31.130> coming<00:04:31.310> out
