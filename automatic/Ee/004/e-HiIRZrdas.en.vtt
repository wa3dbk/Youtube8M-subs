well<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.720> remember<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.619> had

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
well I if I remember right this one had

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
well I if I remember right this one had
a<00:01:23.369> peg<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.509> could<00:01:24.689> stick<00:01:24.869> onto

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a peg right here they could stick onto

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.010 
a peg right here they could stick onto
the<00:01:25.140> back<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.400> peg<00:01:26.820> whole<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.930> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the back because a peg whole but this

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.539 
the back because a peg whole but this
one<00:01:28.140> came<00:01:28.320> broke<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.860> looks<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
one came broke and it looks like so I

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
one came broke and it looks like so I
can't<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.360> which<00:01:30.570> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> sucks<00:01:31.110> but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
can't do that which kind of sucks but

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.539 
can't do that which kind of sucks but
this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> still<00:01:31.710> pretty<00:01:31.829> cool

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
this is still pretty cool

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.380 
this is still pretty cool

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.690 
I had Deadpool on this posing before so

biz<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.610> would<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.090> do<00:02:40.330> actually<00:02:40.510> is

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
biz what I would like to do actually is

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.870 
biz what I would like to do actually is
maybe<00:02:41.110> switch<00:02:41.500> out<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.740> heads<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.250> put<00:02:42.820> a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
maybe switch out the heads and put a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.820 
maybe switch out the heads and put a
Iron<00:02:43.420> Man<00:02:43.690> helmet<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.110> there<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.470> make<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.650> more

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
Iron Man helmet in there to make it more

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.520 
Iron Man helmet in there to make it more
more<00:02:45.700> accurate<00:02:46.150> more<00:02:46.330> updated<00:02:47.020> which<00:02:47.410> would

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
more accurate more updated which would

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.580 
more accurate more updated which would
probably<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.160> pretty<00:02:48.430> cool<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.230> suit<00:02:50.440> is

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
probably be pretty cool but this suit is

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.640 
probably be pretty cool but this suit is
a<00:02:50.620> pretty<00:02:50.830> cool<00:02:51.070> option<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.490> have<00:02:51.640> anyway

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
a pretty cool option to have anyway

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.170 
a pretty cool option to have anyway
getting<00:02:53.650> into<00:02:53.770> articulation<00:02:54.460> really<00:02:54.760> quickly

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
getting into articulation really quickly

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.360 
getting into articulation really quickly
so<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.020> saw<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.350> head<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.950> helmet<00:02:57.250> doesn't

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
so you saw the head the helmet doesn't

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.860 
so you saw the head the helmet doesn't
have<00:02:57.550> any<00:02:57.670> articulation<00:02:58.060> obviously<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.840> just

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
have any articulation obviously it just

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.350 
have any articulation obviously it just
opens<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.620> closes<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.520> head<00:03:00.700> over<00:03:00.940> here<00:03:01.210> I

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
opens and closes the head over here I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.120 
opens and closes the head over here I
think<00:03:01.570> is<00:03:01.810> on<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.960> hinge<00:03:02.200> or<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.470> ball<00:03:02.710> joint<00:03:02.980> so

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
think is on a hinge or a ball joint so

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.550 
think is on a hinge or a ball joint so
it<00:03:03.160> rotates<00:03:03.610> left<00:03:04.270> or<00:03:04.480> right<00:03:04.690> kind<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.350> goes<00:03:05.470> up

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
it rotates left or right kind of goes up

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.820 
it rotates left or right kind of goes up
and<00:03:05.740> down<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.070> little<00:03:06.280> bit<00:03:06.870> going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.110> the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
and down so a little bit going to the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.900 
and down so a little bit going to the
outside<00:03:09.340> these<00:03:10.860> armor<00:03:11.860> parts<00:03:12.160> are<00:03:12.280> rubber<00:03:12.550> so

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
outside these armor parts are rubber so

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.860 
outside these armor parts are rubber so
they<00:03:13.000> don't<00:03:13.180> really<00:03:13.300> get<00:03:13.480> in<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.630> way<00:03:13.750> of

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
they don't really get in a way of

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.650 
they don't really get in a way of
articulation<00:03:14.560> still<00:03:15.220> pretty<00:03:15.520> nice<00:03:15.700> these

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
articulation still pretty nice these

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.970 
articulation still pretty nice these
shoulders<00:03:17.110> aren't<00:03:17.320> hinge<00:03:17.620> joints<00:03:17.920> that

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
shoulders aren't hinge joints that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.220 
shoulders aren't hinge joints that
rotates<00:03:18.459> they<00:03:18.670> go<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.240> out<00:03:19.420> left<00:03:20.110> and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
rotates they go in and out left and

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.460 
rotates they go in and out left and
right

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
right

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.620 
right

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
the sturdy bulky figure so you had to

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.910 
the sturdy bulky figure so you had to
work<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.110> little<00:03:23.230> bit

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
work with it a little bit

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.330
