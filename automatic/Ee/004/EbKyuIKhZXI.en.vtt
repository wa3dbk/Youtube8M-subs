number is the number that we subtract
from<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> number<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:47.970> give<00:01:48.210> us<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
from the number that they give us so

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.300 
from the number that they give us so
we're<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> say<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> spectator

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
we're going to say to the spectator

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
we're going to say to the spectator
after<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.790> cut<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> cards<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> couple<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.869> times

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
after we cut the cards a couple of times

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
after we cut the cards a couple of times
that<00:01:52.740> we'd<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.220> them<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.549> give<00:01:53.700> us<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.970> number

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that we'd like them to give us a number

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.920 
that we'd like them to give us a number
between<00:01:54.899> 1<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.500> 50<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.009> let's<00:01:56.219> say<00:01:56.369> they<00:01:56.549> say

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
between 1 and 50 so let's say they say

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.069 
between 1 and 50 so let's say they say
16<00:01:58.250> we're<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.729> subtract<00:02:00.689> 12<00:02:01.500> from<00:02:02.060> 16<00:02:03.079> 16

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
16 we're going to subtract 12 from 16 16

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.999 
16 we're going to subtract 12 from 16 16
minus<00:02:04.500> 12<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.130> 4<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> spectator

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
minus 12 is 4 so we have the spectator

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.279 
minus 12 is 4 so we have the spectator
to<00:02:08.039> place<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.750> indicated<00:02:09.750> card<00:02:09.959> wherever

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
to place this indicated card wherever

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.960 
to place this indicated card wherever
they<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.099> slide<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> right<00:02:11.940> over

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
they like so they slide it in right over

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.059 
they like so they slide it in right over
there<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> now<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.860> need

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
there and now what we need

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.039 
there and now what we need
to<00:02:14.189> do<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.549> square<00:02:14.969> them<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.480> say<00:02:15.659> okay<00:02:15.989> you

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
to do is square them up and say okay you

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.949 
to do is square them up and say okay you
place<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.680> card<00:02:16.939> right<00:02:17.939> between<00:02:18.209> these<00:02:18.719> two

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
place the card right between these two

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.800 
place the card right between these two
cards<00:02:19.260> over<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.829> and<00:02:20.040> now<00:02:20.579> because<00:02:20.819> 16<00:02:21.420> minus

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
cards over here and now because 16 minus

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.470 
cards over here and now because 16 minus
12<00:02:22.109> is<00:02:22.319> 4<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.489> positive<00:02:23.670> number<00:02:24.150> positive

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
12 is 4 it's a positive number positive

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.099 
12 is 4 it's a positive number positive
4<00:02:24.989> we<00:02:25.109> want<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.379> go<00:02:25.469> 4<00:02:25.829> cards<00:02:26.420> above<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.870> push

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
4 we want to go 4 cards above and push

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.110 
4 we want to go 4 cards above and push
off<00:02:28.349> 4<00:02:28.650> cards<00:02:29.040> right<00:02:29.189> here<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.639> we<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.790> say<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120

is the suit so we can ask the spectator
if<00:02:49.200> they'd<00:02:49.319> like<00:02:49.469> to<00:02:49.530> switch<00:02:49.889> they<00:02:50.340> want<00:02:50.519> to

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
if they'd like to switch they want to

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.490 
if they'd like to switch they want to
switch<00:02:50.849> then<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.299> card<00:02:51.659> is<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> value<00:02:52.260> right

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
switch then this card is the value right

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.220 
switch then this card is the value right
here<00:02:52.829> since<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.639> is<00:02:53.819> value<00:02:54.269> we<00:02:54.719> flip<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.109> over

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
here since this is value we flip it over

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.770 
here since this is value we flip it over
like<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:56.069> they<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.209> card<00:02:57.449> was<00:02:57.629> like

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
like that if they if the card was like

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.689 
like that if they if the card was like
this<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.199> they<00:02:58.260> said<00:02:58.469> value<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.609> to

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699 
this and they said value they want to

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.069 
this and they said value they want to
keep<00:02:59.819> it<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.329> flip<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.599> over<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:01.019> this

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
keep it here we flip it over like this

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.679 
keep it here we flip it over like this
so<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.829> flip<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.129> over<00:03:02.310> get<00:03:02.909> this<00:03:03.180> card<00:03:03.449> to<00:03:03.599> the

than<00:03:36.750> 12<00:03:37.259> let's<00:03:37.979> say<00:03:38.129> they<00:03:38.280> give<00:03:38.489> us<00:03:38.609> the

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
than 12 let's say they give us the

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.210 
than 12 let's say they give us the
number<00:03:39.000> 7<00:03:39.419> we<00:03:39.930> say<00:03:40.079> ok<00:03:40.409> what<00:03:40.680> we'd<00:03:40.829> like<00:03:40.979> you<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
number 7 we say ok what we'd like you to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.149 
number 7 we say ok what we'd like you to
do<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.759> your<00:03:42.599> number<00:03:42.870> 7<00:03:43.349> we're<00:03:43.799> going<00:03:43.949> to<00:03:44.009> try

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
do is your number 7 we're going to try

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.770 
do is your number 7 we're going to try
and<00:03:44.310> find<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.639> card<00:03:44.939> in<00:03:45.180> an<00:03:45.239> unusual<00:03:45.750> way

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
and find the card in an unusual way

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.140 
and find the card in an unusual way
slide<00:03:46.319> this<00:03:46.530> any<00:03:46.799> way<00:03:47.009> you'd<00:03:47.159> like<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.669> let's

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
slide this any way you'd like and let's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.939 
slide this any way you'd like and let's
say<00:03:48.269> they<00:03:48.389> slide<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.870> between<00:03:48.989> these<00:03:49.439> 2<00:03:49.680> cards

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
say they slide it between these 2 cards

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:50.689 
say they slide it between these 2 cards
right<00:03:50.099> over<00:03:50.310> here

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
right over here

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.800 
right over here
now<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:51.569> know<00:03:51.780> number<00:03:52.169> 7<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.979> subtract<00:03:53.549> 7<00:03:54.120> 12

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
now we know number 7 we subtract 7 12

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.369 
now we know number 7 we subtract 7 12
from<00:03:55.079> 7<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:55.859> we<00:03:56.040> say<00:03:56.220> 7<00:03:56.639> minus<00:03:57.000> 12<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.599> negative

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
from 7 so we say 7 minus 12 is negative

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.879 
from 7 so we say 7 minus 12 is negative
5<00:03:58.979> that<00:03:59.699> means<00:04:00.030> we're<00:04:00.989> going<00:04:01.229> to<00:04:01.439> have<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.769> go

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
5 that means we're going to have to go

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.360 
5 that means we're going to have to go
five<00:04:02.219> cards<00:04:02.699> below<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:04.139> we<00:04:04.169> say<00:04:04.650> ok<00:04:04.949> you<00:04:05.009> slit

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
five cards below so we say ok you slit

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.339 
five cards below so we say ok you slit
the<00:04:05.489> card<00:04:05.759> right<00:04:06.449> here<00:04:06.780> between<00:04:06.959> these<00:04:07.290> two

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
the card right here between these two

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.199 
the card right here between these two
cards<00:04:07.919> you<00:04:08.099> could<00:04:08.549> have<00:04:08.669> slipped<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:08.939> card

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
cards you could have slipped the card

off five cards below the these cards

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.990 
off five cards below the these cards
right<00:04:16.169> here<00:04:16.500> move<00:04:16.949> these<00:04:17.130> cards<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.789> top

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
right here move these cards to the top

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.390 
right here move these cards to the top
take<00:04:18.630> these<00:04:18.840> cards<00:04:19.169> out<00:04:19.320> set<00:04:19.769> them<00:04:19.859> down<00:04:19.889> one

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
and value is pointing this way so we

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.920 
and value is pointing this way so we
turn<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.300> over<00:04:27.449> we

8 there's the 5 it's pretty easy to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.980 
8 there's the 5 it's pretty easy to
reset<00:04:50.850> this<00:04:51.030> now<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:54.030> key<00:04:54.300> number<00:04:54.660> like<00:04:54.840> I

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
reset this now the key number like I

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.960 
reset this now the key number like I
said<00:04:55.259> you<00:04:55.380> have<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.590> remember<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:56.070> subtracted

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
said you have to remember is subtracted

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.540 
said you have to remember is subtracted
from<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.810> number<00:04:58.169> they<00:04:58.289> give<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.100> if<00:04:59.340> it's<00:04:59.490> a

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
from the number they give so if it's a

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.060 
from the number they give so if it's a
positive<00:04:59.789> number<00:05:00.509> that<00:05:01.289> we<00:05:01.530> get<00:05:01.710> after<00:05:01.919> we

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
positive number that we get after we

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.219 
positive number that we get after we
subtracted<00:05:02.759> then<00:05:03.240> that's<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.960> amount<00:05:04.110> of

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
subtracted then that's the amount of

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.310 
subtracted then that's the amount of
cards<00:05:04.560> we<00:05:04.680> count<00:05:04.919> above<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:06.570> indicated<00:05:06.990> card

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
cards we count above the indicated card

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.800 
cards we count above the indicated card
if<00:05:07.949> it's<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.430> negative<00:05:08.580> number<00:05:09.150> that's<00:05:09.599> how

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
if it's a negative number that's how

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.680 
if it's a negative number that's how
many<00:05:09.990> we<00:05:10.139> count<00:05:10.380> below<00:05:10.949> now<00:05:11.849> if<00:05:12.180> they<00:05:12.630> should

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
many we count below now if they should

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.370 
many we count below now if they should
happen<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.139> give<00:05:13.349> us<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.560> number<00:05:13.710> above<00:05:14.669> 25<00:05:15.570> so<00:05:16.349> a

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
happen to give us a number above 25 so a

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.400 
happen to give us a number above 25 so a
number<00:05:16.680> between<00:05:16.830> 26<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.759> 50<00:05:18.240> then<00:05:18.930> we're

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
number between 26 and 50 then we're

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.370 
number between 26 and 50 then we're
going<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.770> use<00:05:20.550> number<00:05:20.940> 39<00:05:21.449> as<00:05:21.780> an<00:05:21.990> indicator

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
going to use number 39 as an indicator

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.740 
going to use number 39 as an indicator
so<00:05:23.130> let's<00:05:23.370> say<00:05:23.490> they<00:05:23.610> give<00:05:23.759> us<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:23.970> number<00:05:24.210> 45

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
so let's say they give us the number 45

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.089 
so let's say they give us the number 45
we<00:05:25.530> say<00:05:25.710> 45<00:05:26.280> minus<00:05:26.789> 39<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:27.570> 6<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.289> we're<00:05:28.979> going

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
we say 45 minus 39 is 6 and we're going

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.120 
we say 45 minus 39 is 6 and we're going
to<00:05:29.130> go<00:05:29.280> 6<00:05:29.639> cards<00:05:30.150> above<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.349> indicator<00:05:31.830> card

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
to go 6 cards above the indicator card

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.219 
to go 6 cards above the indicator card
