okay<00:00:01.110> so<00:00:01.829> we<00:00:02.370> have<00:00:02.820> our<00:00:03.179> horizontal<00:00:03.990> enemies

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
okay so we have our horizontal enemies

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.670 
okay so we have our horizontal enemies
moving<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:06.359> need<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.569> create<00:00:07.080> vertical

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
moving we need to create vertical

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.709 
moving we need to create vertical
enemies<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.309> go<00:00:08.429> up<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.760> down<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.480> have

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
enemies that go up and down that we have

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.299 
enemies that go up and down that we have
to<00:00:09.870> avoid<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.349> we're<00:00:10.800> also<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> make

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
to avoid and we're also going to make

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.410 
to avoid and we're also going to make
the<00:00:12.030> door<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.559> level<00:00:13.889> such<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.120> when<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the door in this level such that when I

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.390 
the door in this level such that when I
collide<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.410> advance<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> next

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
collide with it I advance to the next

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.840 
collide with it I advance to the next
level<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.320> your<00:00:19.650> project<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.250> should<00:00:20.699> have

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
level so in your project you should have

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.429 
level so in your project you should have
already<00:00:21.180> created<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.289> vertical<00:00:22.970> guard<00:00:23.970> I'm

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
already created the vertical guard I'm

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.810 
already created the vertical guard I'm
going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.519> what<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:26.789> going

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
going to do that here and what I'm going

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to do that here and what I'm going
to<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.240> I'm<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.810> duplicate

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
to do is I'm actually going to duplicate

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.240 
to do is I'm actually going to duplicate
the<00:00:28.710> whole<00:00:28.939> horizontal<00:00:29.939> guard<00:00:30.650> object<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.189> I'm

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the whole horizontal guard object so I'm

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
the whole horizontal guard object so I'm
going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> duplicate<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.329> I'm<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
going to duplicate that and I'm going to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.700 
going to duplicate that and I'm going to
call<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:35.930> obj<00:00:36.930> guard<00:00:37.770> V<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.670> vertical<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
call it now obj guard V for vertical and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.520 
call it now obj guard V for vertical and
in<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.829> case<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.340> am<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> change<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.320> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
in this case I am going to change this I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
in this case I am going to change this I
don't<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:43.890> him<00:00:44.040> moving<00:00:44.399> left<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
don't want him moving left and right I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.350 
don't want him moving left and right I
do<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:46.020> him<00:00:46.110> moving<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.649> down<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.360> when

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
do want him moving up and down and when

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
do want him moving up and down and when
he<00:00:48.539> collides<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> wall<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:50.250> him

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
he collides at the wall I don't want him

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.270 
he collides at the wall I don't want him
changing<00:00:50.910> horizontal<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.050> rather<00:00:52.379> vertical

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
changing horizontal but rather vertical

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.569 
changing horizontal but rather vertical
direction<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> much<00:00:56.100> going

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
enemies so I'm going to go to objects

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.329 
enemies so I'm going to go to objects
I'm<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> add<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.589> let<00:01:04.769> me<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.129> let

now that's fine as you create your game
you're<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> start<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> assess<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you're going to start to assess the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.469 
you're going to start to assess the
level<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.140> difficulty<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:44.040> challenge<00:01:44.479> you're

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
level of difficulty or challenge you're

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.660 
level of difficulty or challenge you're
going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.780> other<00:01:46.049> players<00:01:46.560> assess<00:01:47.430> that

and one of the nice things is you know

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.190 
and one of the nice things is you know
iterating<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.579> adding<00:01:54.090> those<00:01:54.270> extra

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
iterating and just adding those extra

enemies to make it more challenging all
those<00:01:56.880> things<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.270> pretty<00:01:57.420> easy<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.110> once

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
those things are pretty easy and once

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.789 
those things are pretty easy and once
you<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> game<00:01:59.579> mechanics<00:01:59.759> going<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
you get the game mechanics going and

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
you get the game mechanics going and
you're<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.009> eventually<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.729> creating

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you're going to eventually be creating

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
you're going to eventually be creating
multiple<00:02:03.509> levels<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.229> should<00:02:04.469> get<00:02:04.560> more

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
multiple levels so they should get more

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.760 
multiple levels so they should get more
challenging<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.969> move<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.020> I've<00:02:07.530> done

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
challenging as you move on so I've done

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.760 
challenging as you move on so I've done
that<00:02:07.829> let's<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.610> my<00:02:09.239> object<00:02:10.200> uh<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
that let's just see if my object uh I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.790 
that let's just see if my object uh I
bet<00:02:11.340> my<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.959> bet<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.020> will<00:02:13.319> not

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
bet my I bet I will not

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.060 
bet my I bet I will not
have<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.040> working<00:02:14.640> yet<00:02:14.940> where<00:02:15.350> when<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.590> don't

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
have it working yet where when I I don't

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.610 
have it working yet where when I I don't
think<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.430> did<00:02:17.580> anything<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:18.240> when<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.620> collide

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
think I did anything for when I collide

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800 
think I did anything for when I collide
with<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.280> vertical<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.450> why<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.750> do

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
with the vertical one so why don't I do

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
with the vertical one so why don't I do
that<00:02:22.110> because<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.590> kind<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.890> know<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
that because we kind of know that and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.340 
that because we kind of know that and
again<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.180> could<00:02:24.330> duplicate<00:02:24.960> this

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
again I could duplicate this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.730 
again I could duplicate this
so<00:02:25.470> when<00:02:25.650> Bilbo<00:02:26.160> collides<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.560> I'm<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.680> to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
so when Bilbo collides with I'm going to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.150 
so when Bilbo collides with I'm going to
duplicate<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.490> when<00:02:30.300> he<00:02:30.480> collides<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.160> obj

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
duplicate this when he collides with obj

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.430 
duplicate this when he collides with obj
vertical<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:33.360> watch<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.050> already<00:02:34.230> great

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
vertical now watch this is already great

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.640 
vertical now watch this is already great
because<00:02:35.270> jumping<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.390> start<00:02:36.720> self<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.410> still

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
because jumping to start self is still

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.730 
because jumping to start self is still
correct<00:02:38.300> jumping<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.420> start<00:02:39.720> other<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.380> still

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
correct jumping to start other is still

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.930 
correct jumping to start other is still
correct<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.250> don't<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.610> make<00:02:41.730> any

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
correct so I don't have to make any

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.850 
correct so I don't have to make any
changes<00:02:42.450> there<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.260> I'm<00:02:43.320> going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> test<00:02:43.650> my

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
changes there so I'm going to test my

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.880 
changes there so I'm going to test my
game<00:02:44.100> real<00:02:44.340> quick<00:02:44.960> I'm<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:45.990> fan<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.290> continually

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
game real quick I'm a fan of continually

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.690 
game real quick I'm a fan of continually
testing<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:48.390> way<00:02:48.510> if<00:02:48.690> an<00:02:49.140> error<00:02:49.320> arises<00:02:50.160> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
testing that way if an error arises you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.220 
testing that way if an error arises you
kind<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> know<00:02:51.150> where<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.540> root<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.050> was

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
kind of know where the root of it was

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.430 
kind of know where the root of it was
ups<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.010> there<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.490> did<00:02:53.970> jump<00:02:54.360> back<00:02:54.570> he<00:02:55.080> jumped

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
ups so there I did jump back he jumped

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.340 
ups so there I did jump back he jumped
back<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:57.000> working<00:02:57.450> right<00:02:57.630> so

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
back and all of that is working right so

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.160 
back and all of that is working right so
now<00:02:58.590> run<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.460> next<00:02:59.790> step<00:03:00.420> which<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:00.930> going

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
now run to the next step which is going

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.840 
now run to the next step which is going
to<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:02.750> move<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.140> next<00:03:04.290> room<00:03:04.740> now<00:03:05.610> when

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
to be to move to the next room now when

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.720 
to be to move to the next room now when
I<00:03:05.880> collide<00:03:06.210> with<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.450> door<00:03:06.660> now<00:03:07.580> right<00:03:08.580> now<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
I collide with the door now right now I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.150 
I collide with the door now right now I
don't<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.540> ruin<00:03:09.990> Eckstrom<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.920> would

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
don't have a ruin Eckstrom so I would

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.860 
don't have a ruin Eckstrom so I would
get<00:03:11.310> an<00:03:11.430> error<00:03:11.670> if<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.180> told<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
get an error if I told it to go to the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.720 
get an error if I told it to go to the
next<00:03:13.080> room<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.830> I'm<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.100> avoid<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.490> by

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
next room so I'm going to avoid that by

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.390 
next room so I'm going to avoid that by
creating<00:03:15.060> my<00:03:15.390> next<00:03:15.690> room<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.200> I'll<00:03:16.980> call<00:03:17.190> this

other words in this game so far it's
pretty<00:04:53.819> just<00:04:54.509> linear<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.199> get<00:04:55.530> through

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
pretty just linear that I get through

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.189 
pretty just linear that I get through
one<00:04:55.979> level<00:04:56.189> into<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.550> next<00:04:56.849> as<00:04:57.629> you<00:04:57.870> make<00:04:58.020> your

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
one level into the next as you make your

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.510 
one level into the next as you make your
adventure<00:04:58.530> game<00:04:58.680> I'd<00:04:58.830> love<00:04:59.039> for<00:04:59.069> you<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.430> have

adventure game I'd love for you to have
different<00:05:00.060> choices<00:05:00.210> where<00:05:00.659> I<00:05:00.689> can<00:05:00.960> exit

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
different choices where I can exit

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.110 
different choices where I can exit
through<00:05:01.620> different<00:05:02.129> parts<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.699> room<00:05:02.879> to

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
through different parts of the room to

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.790 
through different parts of the room to
go<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.330> different<00:05:03.569> places<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.319> really<00:05:04.409> create

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
go to different places and really create

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.390 
go to different places and really create
an<00:05:04.889> adventure<00:05:05.370> idea<00:05:05.969> so<00:05:06.770> let's<00:05:07.770> try<00:05:07.979> this<00:05:08.039> much

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
an adventure idea so let's try this much

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.779 
an adventure idea so let's try this much
and<00:05:09.050> once<00:05:10.050> we've<00:05:10.349> done<00:05:10.379> that<00:05:10.620> it'll<00:05:11.430> be<00:05:11.550> your

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
and once we've done that it'll be your

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.399 
and once we've done that it'll be your
turn<00:05:11.819> and<00:05:12.300> then<00:05:12.389> you'll<00:05:12.539> even<00:05:12.689> create<00:05:13.080> level

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
turn and then you'll even create level

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.110 
turn and then you'll even create level
two<00:05:13.590> so<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:13.860> have<00:05:13.949> a<00:05:14.009> little<00:05:14.219> more<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.819> do<00:05:14.939> on

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
two so you have a little more to do on

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.459 
two so you have a little more to do on
your<00:05:15.270> own<00:05:15.300> now<00:05:15.629> so<00:05:16.500> let's<00:05:16.800> say<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:19.050> far

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
your own now so let's say so far

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.290 
your own now so let's say so far
shouldn't<00:05:20.310> be<00:05:20.400> too<00:05:20.550> difficult<00:05:20.580> because<00:05:21.150> I

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
shouldn't be too difficult because I

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.790 
shouldn't be too difficult because I
didn't<00:05:21.599> add<00:05:21.779> the<00:05:22.050> element<00:05:22.409> where<00:05:22.529> I<00:05:22.560> need<00:05:22.770> to

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
didn't add the element where I need to

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.990 
didn't add the element where I need to
get<00:05:23.189> a<00:05:23.219> key<00:05:23.520> or<00:05:23.759> anything<00:05:25.069> I<00:05:26.069> will<00:05:26.699> wait<00:05:26.969> for

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
get a key or anything I will wait for

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.969 
get a key or anything I will wait for
these<00:05:27.300> guys<00:05:27.539> get<00:05:27.840> on<00:05:27.870> my<00:05:28.080> way<00:05:28.289> um<00:05:29.659> I<00:05:30.800> think<00:05:31.800> I'm

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
these guys get on my way um I think I'm

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.909 
these guys get on my way um I think I'm
going<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.339> right<00:05:32.490> way

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
going the right way

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.230 
going the right way
got<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:34.949> little<00:05:35.129> faster<00:05:35.580> than<00:05:35.669> that<00:05:35.789> guy<00:05:35.969> so<00:05:36.180> I

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
got a little faster than that guy so I

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.579 
got a little faster than that guy so I
might<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.449> able<00:05:36.509> to<00:05:36.659> cut<00:05:36.810> him<00:05:36.960> off<00:05:37.050> at<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.259> pass

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589 
might be able to cut him off at the pass

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:41.510 
might be able to cut him off at the pass
and<00:05:39.259> to<00:05:40.259> test<00:05:40.500> your<00:05:40.710> rooms<00:05:40.919> too<00:05:41.219> a<00:05:41.250> lot<00:05:41.460> of

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
and to test your rooms too a lot of

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.839 
and to test your rooms too a lot of
times<00:05:41.610> what<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:41.969> do<00:05:42.060> is<00:05:42.449> rather<00:05:43.139> than<00:05:43.849> playing

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
times what I do is rather than playing

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.969 
times what I do is rather than playing
through<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.240> whole<00:05:45.449> long<00:05:45.629> level<00:05:45.990> like<00:05:46.229> this<00:05:46.409> you

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
through a whole long level like this you

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.149 
through a whole long level like this you
might<00:05:47.129> move<00:05:47.339> your<00:05:47.520> door<00:05:47.759> a<00:05:47.969> lot<00:05:48.240> closer<00:05:48.569> to<00:05:48.779> you

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
might move your door a lot closer to you

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.950 
might move your door a lot closer to you
just<00:05:50.159> so<00:05:50.219> you<00:05:50.250> can<00:05:50.400> test<00:05:50.669> that<00:05:50.909> it<00:05:51.000> works<00:05:51.240> but

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
just so you can test that it works but

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.350 
just so you can test that it works but
I'm<00:05:52.169> almost<00:05:52.289> there<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:52.860> here<00:05:53.219> we<00:05:53.339> go<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.819> now

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
I'm almost there and here we go and now

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.990 
I'm almost there and here we go and now
I'm<00:05:54.690> in<00:05:54.870> level<00:05:55.289> 2<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:55.770> remember<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.580> Bilbo's

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
I'm in level 2 and remember the Bilbo's

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.779 
I'm in level 2 and remember the Bilbo's
still<00:05:57.300> programmed<00:05:57.599> so<00:05:58.020> he<00:05:58.199> still<00:05:58.529> moves<00:05:58.800> so

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
still programmed so he still moves so

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.029 
still programmed so he still moves so
we're<00:06:00.360> pretty<00:06:00.509> good<00:06:00.629> shape<00:06:00.930> now<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:01.620> now

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
we're pretty good shape now and now

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.950 
we're pretty good shape now and now
you're<00:06:02.400> going<00:06:02.550> to<00:06:02.610> create<00:06:03.210> what<00:06:03.419> you<00:06:03.449> want<00:06:03.569> for

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
you're going to create what you want for

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.119 
you're going to create what you want for
this<00:06:04.110> room

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
this room

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.189 
this room
in<00:06:05.339> fact<00:06:05.639> what<00:06:05.879> I'll<00:06:05.969> tell<00:06:06.089> you<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.330> do<00:06:06.479> now<00:06:06.659> is

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
create room two and room 3 presumably

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.010 
create room two and room 3 presumably
and<00:06:11.009> have<00:06:11.909> it<00:06:12.060> all<00:06:12.150> working<00:06:12.569> that<00:06:12.719> you<00:06:12.750> have

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
and have it all working that you have

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.709 
and have it all working that you have
enemies<00:06:13.379> in<00:06:13.409> in<00:06:13.860> all<00:06:14.039> three<00:06:14.310> rooms<00:06:14.580> and<00:06:15.029> you

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
enemies in in all three rooms and you

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.540 
enemies in in all three rooms and you
advance<00:06:16.050> from<00:06:16.319> room<00:06:16.500> to<00:06:16.680> room<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.159> all<00:06:17.370> that

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
advance from room to room and all that

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.550 
advance from room to room and all that
and<00:06:17.789> there's<00:06:18.240> still<00:06:18.389> so<00:06:18.599> much<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.960> get<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.169> but

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
and there's still so much to get to but

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.890 
and there's still so much to get to but
this<00:06:19.830> is<00:06:19.889> a<00:06:20.039> great<00:06:20.400> point<00:06:21.089> to<00:06:21.210> be<00:06:21.389> at<00:06:21.479> right<00:06:21.659> now

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
this is a great point to be at right now

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.210 
this is a great point to be at right now
so<00:06:22.139> good<00:06:22.740> luck<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.099> I'll<00:06:23.430> see<00:06:23.879> you<00:06:24.000> soon
