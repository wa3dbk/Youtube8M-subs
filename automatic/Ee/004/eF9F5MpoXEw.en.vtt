three grounders which is one target and

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.360 
three grounders which is one target and
the<00:04:09.630> other<00:04:09.720> two<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.080> getting<00:04:10.890> some<00:04:11.010> dragons

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
excuse me there's six and lava golem is

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.789 
excuse me there's six and lava golem is
another<00:04:13.650> one<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.640> there<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.120> our<00:04:15.240> draw<00:04:15.420> power

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
another one so there is our draw power

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.349 
another one so there is our draw power
the<00:04:16.799> guy<00:04:16.950> who<00:04:17.010> made<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.340> deck<00:04:17.580> used<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:18.000> cat<00:04:18.239> of

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
the guy who made the deck used a cat of

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.200 
the guy who made the deck used a cat of
ill<00:04:18.480> omen<00:04:18.690> which<00:04:19.500> has<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.710> flip<00:04:19.950> effect<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:21.060> can

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
ill omen which has a flip effect you can

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.070 
ill omen which has a flip effect you can
move<00:04:21.720> one<00:04:21.930> trap<00:04:22.260> from<00:04:22.500> your<00:04:22.710> deck<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.490> tub

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
move one trap from your deck to the tub

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.180 
move one trap from your deck to the tub
to<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> top<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.800> essentially

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
to the top so it essentially

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.400 
to the top so it essentially
you'll<00:04:26.280> draw<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.550> next<00:04:26.730> turn<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.690> assume<00:04:28.380> he

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
you'll draw it next turn so I assume he

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.660 
you'll draw it next turn so I assume he
was<00:04:28.650> using<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.160> get<00:04:29.280> removed

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
was using that to get removed

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.580 
was using that to get removed
brainwashing<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.390> think<00:04:30.660> gold<00:04:30.840> sarcophagus<00:04:31.170> is

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
brainwashing I think gold sarcophagus is

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.550 
brainwashing I think gold sarcophagus is
a<00:04:31.620> little<00:04:31.860> bit<00:04:31.980> better<00:04:33.230> doesn't<00:04:34.230> waste<00:04:34.440> a

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
a little bit better doesn't waste a

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.500 
a little bit better doesn't waste a
normal<00:04:34.830> summon<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.850> what<00:04:36.030> you<00:04:36.150> could<00:04:36.300> get

so<00:04:39.900> I'm<00:04:39.960> using<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.260> instead<00:04:41.840> additionally

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
so I'm using that instead additionally

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.260 
so I'm using that instead additionally
instead<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.860> two<00:04:44.070> bottomless<00:04:44.700> he<00:04:44.880> uses

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
instead of the two bottomless he uses

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.720 
instead of the two bottomless he uses
solemn<00:04:45.660> warnings<00:04:46.080> one<00:04:46.890> I<00:04:47.100> don't<00:04:47.280> have<00:04:47.460> my
