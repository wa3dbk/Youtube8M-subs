 but they have to put in like this 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.040
 well let's learn the intent 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.860
 good first thing in the camera 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.860
 we go to a good webcam 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.360

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.360

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.510
 vÃ©lez 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.510
 look at the key that is the one above 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.890
 we need them 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.390
 Well look what happens when I 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.880
 press the t key above 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.030
 It is wide when the bottom one grows 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.340
 you feel when neighbor on one side 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.340
 as well as pressing it on the other 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.229
 let's Dance 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.869
 good another would be like putting something of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.090
 background they appear that well pictures is 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.310
 when they turn on their good nintendo what 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
 It has to be very easy to give several 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.979
 sometimes the ditch and the last one leave it with 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.979
 the little star 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.270
 and the photos that you want good 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.040
 and this tutorials of all antonio 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.480
 toni and then good others 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.730
 a curiosity would be because the companies 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.730
 we have the game we close them 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.810
 look how it 's learned look at the game 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.170
 automatically reason is paid 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.849
 unknown good now is the time 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 they saw how it turned on normal good now 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:52.860
 yes we press the lyr start key 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.860
 we turn it on we stop pressing 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.400
 good in case you do not serve the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.810
 keys king he is what he has to be is 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.600
 very simple you have to swallow all 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.080
 your skills 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.380
 and blow maximum for about 10 or 20 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.380
 seconds 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.800
 the reason why they do not work is because 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.750
 excess dust can be that the keys 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.490
 they have gotten dust because we are going to 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.490
 press again start 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.349
 and calibration of the tactical screen 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.590
 as it says on the screen 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.590
 above 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.170
 good what you have to do to 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.569
 calibrate the touch screen is very 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.989
 simple 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.909
 follow the dot and be with him but 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.159
 for me I did not like to release it 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.159
 because my screen is deep 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.230
 others would be like changing color to 20 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.430
 when they start their mind it is not so new 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.629
 and you see that you do not put a color that 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.629
 are these from the applications 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.880
 they are going to give it in configuration they are going to 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:17.620
 go to the second option 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.720
 the color profile and here you can choose your 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.610
 favorite color as well shown in 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.159
 the options above 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.870
 with the favorites the yellow I leave it 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.240
 in yellow 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.949
 as also the name of its user 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.639
 when they see pinned to happen 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.639
 walking 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.560
 how to change the personal message of 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.850
 salvation 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.850
 almost all the mind 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.080
 another would be that a curiosity would be that 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.500
 because I like my keys can move 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.500
 this 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.130
 the applications too but because 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.970
 when we press some corner of the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:12.950
 screen while you watch my keys as 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.950
 owner not appreciating anything just press 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.810
 Maradona 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.210
