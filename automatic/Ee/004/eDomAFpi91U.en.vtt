00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.670
 very good girls very good guys and 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.830
 diptychs and we are in a very news 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.410
 important and very serious the title will put 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.940
 they deceive us they are deceiving us what is 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.480
 what is happening the truth is that 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.289
 there are reasons to ask and it is that the 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.800
 call of duty 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.839
 both warfare good all the right of 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.439
 well it is known that they have published since 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:34.690
 the principle that a new engine would have 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.700
 new graphic in hyde but attention 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.640
 because there is a call of duty graphic engine 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.270
 also warfare uses some lines 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.460
 of the old graphic engine especially in 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.260
 The special gamer report dedicated to 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.080
 call of duty ando with sugar far 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.530
 sledgehammer games stated that the game 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.720
 used a new graphic engine from there 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.700
 that many fans will be skeptical 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.160
 as to what that really 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.000
 it meant in the most recent edition 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.920
 from the website age michael condrey 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.990
 commented how is the graphic engine that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.270
 they use and how it works 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.159
 michael commented that the team had 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.189
 developed most of the new engine 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.380
 graph from scratch but attention to 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.530
 some lines of the old graphic engine 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.990
 of the old law still remain in the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.200
 declaring that the old graphic engine is 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.000
 barely unrecognizable 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.170
 despite what we want to say with 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.469
 this context with this new and what 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.469
 we want 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.130
 despite what we want to say with 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.020
 new in this context does not mean what 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 same on the internet when we talk about 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 old call of duty graphic engine 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.070
 there is a jazz of the old graphic engine 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.810
 that continue in both warfare as well as the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.479
 most of the graphics engines that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.000
 they use other studies when entering the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.060
 annexation but it has been built from scratch 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.600
 so that it is almost unrecognizable so 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.990
 so much as he said he will have new 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.400
 standardized physical animation system 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.280
 and audio but it's not a graphic engine 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.760
 from scratch or that is in the bases 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.800
 of the graphic motor therefore no 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.290
 they told the whole truth to the fans 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.690
 from the beginning not to be seen are what 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.820
 that I give me internet I do not know what 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.330
 you will think I do not know what you are thinking 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.920
 right now in your heads but there 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.230
 there are the statements of michael 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.570
 country you know how always 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.760
 informing the last the favorite X 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.300
 I want your comments here below or 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.300
 if not you
