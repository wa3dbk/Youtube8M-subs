00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.859
 fc groningen will go up on Thursday evening 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.670
 visit the leader ajax in Amsterdam 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.319
 arena 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.090
 this groningen leaves nothing to chance 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.730
 and therefore trains in the run-up to 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.769
 that encounter with this ball the brazuca 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 The World Cup ball in the ball that Ajax uses this 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.510
 season the home games plays how 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.410
 yes he feels have anything else to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.050
 balls where we normally 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.689
 play along are somewhat heavier these 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.680
 yes have a bit of a weird yes you must 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.769
 I don't know I have to get used to it 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 but that's why they do this week's movie 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.219
 also not, then it should be fine 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 come thursday 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.090
 it makes a difference to you for what 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 football you play well you are yourself 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 of course used to crime idea 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.559
 balls but once you get a pair 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 train all day with this ball 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.190
 then thereby the one you notice that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.390
 which balls does something else that they put in the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.140
 is in the air and that he is something 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.820
 easier yes' says a little mop 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.739
 so that is with a cross 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.989
 for example, that is somewhat more difficult 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.059
 but well i have no problem 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.140
 must be and we now have a number 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.160
 days logging 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.370
 to get used to it find the good ball the taste 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.030
 the herbs that are in it the profile 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.229
 good 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.550
 the whole phone that you grip and it is something 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.070
 lighter as the the derby star that we 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.870
 so for the trampled snow and 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.240
 for catching for tight grip yes 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.670
 that is when I earn even now 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.380
 those balls time that there was little 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.610
 with these balls that go in all directions 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.420
 I feel a little less 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.770
 feeling in them I have yes it's not it 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.259
 is of course a bit different me 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.250
 not very different or something but it is 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.780
 getting used to a new one 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.520
 succeed with another banger because you 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.740
 just a tuesday are just one 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.149
 I have to be fine 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.940
 Ajax and FC Groningen meet 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.770
 Thursday for the 42nd time in Amsterdam 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.780
 FC Groningen won two of the 41 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.050
 played matches and played 8 times 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.610
 sound like on December 1, 1996 when it 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.660
 a he was thanks to a goal from 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.880
 that gorree 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.410
 in the point lead is ajax 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.780
 tries there then plays the last weeks 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.060
 but here nine minutes bombarda party 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.890
 sees with for one 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.550
 sion that prunes some time and sorry 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.250
 To this see it is a one 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.890
 Hoogstraten by the robot they take 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.920
 be aware but feel bad and how 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.410
 are you 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.800
 or clean water is a good offense 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.200
 of worries and it was natural 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.200
 sports app had that there is blood 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.840
 This is one more time 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.480
 and now he is sitting there 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.019
 a safe neighborhood 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.019
 his revenge 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.959
 from matthijs step 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.549
 So 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.360
 Marcus Berg's second goal 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.610
 the last goal and fc groningen 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.290
 scored in the Amsterdam arena with be 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.880
 sometimes after five and a half years 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.160
 time there is going to score FC Groningen 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.120
 Amsterdam unfortunately cannot accept Ajax 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.340
 I think put in it 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.160
 to be very lucky but no 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.720
 he had php what they can fire rouge 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.730
 noir 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.930
 but no, we hope that we simply that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.350
 score and that a nice pot can 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.690
 play 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.130
 that's just very necessary we have to 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.800
 to win more games we have 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.540
 now two games went did not go 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.040
 so won if we made that connection 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.020
 tepid with 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.910
 with those 4p or places then and then will 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.360
 we still have to win Thursday through 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.970
 awkward out at ajax but yes we go there 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.530
 everything to do to try and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.520
 to make a turd and below zero 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.560
 to hold 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.390
 score with zambo yes they are beautiful 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.720
 machines needed 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.720
 he's finished
