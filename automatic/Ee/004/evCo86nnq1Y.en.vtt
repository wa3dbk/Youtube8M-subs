00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.200
 the indirect ophthalmoscope 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.440
 ah 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.330
 the indirect ophthalmoscope is placed in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.150
 the head of the explorer has a light 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.509
 intense that is regulated from the base of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.790
 device said light is directed towards the 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.239
 inside the patient's eye through 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.610
 an adjustable mirror the reflected light is 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.950
 condensed in a lens from 20 to 28 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 diopters that produces an image of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.100
 fundus enlarged to about 8 d of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.920
 Virtual and inverted provides images 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.890
 of quality even with small pupils 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.109
 and it offers a wide field of vision and a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.620
 rapid evaluation even in patients 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.660
 little collaborators or in children allows 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.359
 observe the entire retina and with a 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.640
 device identified through the 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.010
 eyelid or directly in the eye after 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.050
 of applying topical anesthesia can be 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.650
 evaluate the peripheral retina with more 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.600
 detail and even the flat part 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.810
 on the left side of the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.720
 Ophthalmoscope exists a device for 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.510
 change the size of the light used with 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.050
 three circles of increasing size for 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.140
 adapt to the pupil size the least for 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.830
 pupils my ticas the medium for 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.120
 intermediate and the greater for pupils well 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.340
 dilated on the right side of the 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.120
 Ophthalmoscope there is also a small 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.479
 lever with three positions one position 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.930
 for white light and two others for 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.540
 lights with filters a green filter for 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.840
 better observe the macula the vessels 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.330
 blood and nerve fibers and a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.810
 blue filter to see the injuries with 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.960
 fluorescein advantages of loft al mosco 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.150
 indirectly its intense illumination and 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.580
 adjustable allows you to value the fund of 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.160
 eye even with opacity of means and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.380
 high refractive errors has a 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.450
 wide field of vision and allows the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.430
 stereoscopic binocular vision 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.049
 important when evaluating it 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.140
 disadvantages vitreorretiniana has the 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.310
 disadvantage of providing an image 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.890
 inverted that hinders your 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.219
 interpretation and requires skill and a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.769
 long learning ophthalmologists 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.709
 we usually use the spans copied 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.329
 indirect in both the clinic and the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.329
