00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
them fell out quite lost I have to pin

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.730 
them fell out quite lost I have to pin
them<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:13.100> quite<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> lot<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:16.050> piece<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.590> never

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
them in quite a lot this piece I never

somewhere<00:03:18.360> down<00:03:18.690> fun<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.350> then<00:03:19.500> weird<00:03:20.190> I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
somewhere down fun and then weird I

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.330 
somewhere down fun and then weird I
finally<00:03:22.260> found<00:03:22.440> out<00:03:22.680> where<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.950> looks<00:03:23.130> good

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
finally found out where it looks good

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.570 
finally found out where it looks good
but<00:03:23.640> if<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:24.870> pin<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.050> here<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.740> keep

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
but if you just pin it here just to keep

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.040 
but if you just pin it here just to keep
it<00:03:26.730> out<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.880> way<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.240> now<00:03:28.910> ok<00:03:29.910> now<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:30.900> you

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
it out of the way for now ok now if you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.980 
it out of the way for now ok now if you
go<00:03:31.140> back<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.320> your<00:03:31.470> ponytail<00:03:32.750> take<00:03:33.750> out<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
go back to your ponytail take out a

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.460 
go back to your ponytail take out a
section<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.350> hair<00:03:34.410> brush<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:37.020> we're

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
section of hair brush that and we're

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.340 
section of hair brush that and we're
just<00:03:37.560> going<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.770> plot<00:03:37.980> this

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.010 

afraid

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.290 

we're<00:03:48.680> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.890> wrap<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.310> around<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:50.120> hair

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
we're going to wrap this around the hair

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:59.110 
we're going to wrap this around the hair
scrunchie<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.050> we<00:03:51.110> can<00:03:51.290> see<00:03:51.560> it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.059 

hopefully<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.080> will<00:04:00.140> go<00:04:00.260> around<00:04:00.349> twice<00:04:00.620> and

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
hopefully that will go around twice and

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.550 
hopefully that will go around twice and
you<00:04:01.190> can<00:04:01.370> just<00:04:01.489> pin<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:01.760> at<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.090> bottom

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
you can just pin it at the bottom

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.890 
you can just pin it at the bottom
underneath<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:04.700> pointy<00:04:05.000> tail<00:04:07.659> and<00:04:08.659> then<00:04:08.780> you

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
underneath the pointy tail and then you

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.390 
underneath the pointy tail and then you
had<00:04:09.049> it<00:04:11.440> okay<00:04:12.440> now<00:04:12.890> we're<00:04:13.010> going<00:04:13.099> to<00:04:13.159> start

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
had it okay now we're going to start

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.520 
had it okay now we're going to start
with<00:04:13.849> our<00:04:14.829> current<00:04:15.829> all<00:04:17.290> first<00:04:18.290> we're<00:04:18.440> going

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
with our current all first we're going

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:29.590 
with our current all first we're going
to<00:04:18.590> just<00:04:18.769> curl<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.609> will<00:04:19.729> face

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.420 

I<00:04:29.750> just<00:04:30.140> want<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.500> look<00:04:30.710> really<00:04:30.920> nice<00:04:31.100> and
