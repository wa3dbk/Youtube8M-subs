00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.860 

all<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:11.830> way<00:03:11.920> through<00:03:12.160> until<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.490> goes

balls<00:03:24.110> or<00:03:24.379> something<00:03:24.409> that<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:25.610> then<00:03:25.900> after

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
balls or something that and then after

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.290 
balls or something that and then after
