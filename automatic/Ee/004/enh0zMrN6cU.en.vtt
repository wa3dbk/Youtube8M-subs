that we had Lysol painted that's really
the<00:00:24.060> only<00:00:24.150> reason<00:00:24.300> why<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.570> painted<00:00:25.310> just<00:00:26.310> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the only reason why it's painted just to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.759 
the only reason why it's painted just to
kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> give<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> quick<00:00:26.970> lowdown<00:00:27.740> how<00:00:28.740> I

PVC okay this is the one I didn't

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770 
PVC okay this is the one I didn't
purchase<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.200> 3/4<00:00:38.100> inch<00:00:38.129> tube<00:00:38.730> ball<00:00:39.270> valve

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
purchase it's a 3/4 inch tube ball valve

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.530 
purchase it's a 3/4 inch tube ball valve
see<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.680> mark<00:00:40.860> 3/4<00:00:41.460> inch<00:00:41.640> right<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.270> maybe

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
see it mark 3/4 inch right there maybe

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.119 
see it mark 3/4 inch right there maybe
you<00:00:42.660> can't<00:00:43.070> sew<00:00:44.070> shops<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> off<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you can't sew shops on and off so I

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
you can't sew shops on and off so I
start<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> process<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.210> meant<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> run

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
start the process this is meant to run

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.799 
start the process this is meant to run
to<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> garden<00:00:50.219> hose<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.149> garden<00:00:51.480> hose<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to a garden hose the garden hose I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
to a garden hose the garden hose I
actually<00:00:52.020> use<00:00:52.379> runs<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.250> water<00:00:53.520> heater

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
actually use runs to my water heater

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
actually use runs to my water heater
which<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.300> actually<00:00:54.989> also<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.230> close<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
which is actually also be close to a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.990 
which is actually also be close to a
window<00:00:56.789> well<00:00:57.680> inside<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:58.949> house<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.850> just

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
window well inside my house I can just

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.420 
window well inside my house I can just
basically<00:01:00.239> move<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.930> hose<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:02.280> then

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
basically move that hose and then

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.429 
basically move that hose and then
basically<00:01:02.940> plug<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> from<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> bottom<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
basically plug it from the bottom of the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.469 
basically plug it from the bottom of the
water<00:01:04.619> heater<00:01:04.729> water<00:01:05.729> heaters<00:01:06.030> tend<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> be

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
water heater water heaters tend to be

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.600 
water heater water heaters tend to be
you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.930> obviously<00:01:07.220> offering<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.430> hot

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
you know obviously offering very hot

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
you know obviously offering very hot
water<00:01:08.760> about<00:01:09.000> 140<00:01:09.659> 150<00:01:09.960> degrees<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.979> found

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
water about 140 150 degrees and I found

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
water about 140 150 degrees and I found
that<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> extremely<00:01:12.210> hot<00:01:12.390> water

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that if you use to extremely hot water

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
that if you use to extremely hot water
it<00:01:13.320> definitely<00:01:13.710> puts<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> better<00:01:14.159> sheen<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it definitely puts a better sheen on the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
it definitely puts a better sheen on the
ice<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.330> melt<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> very<00:01:16.170> top<00:01:16.439> surface<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
ice it melt that very top surface to the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
ice it melt that very top surface to the
ice<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.490> provides<00:01:18.479> overall<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
ice and just provides overall just a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.820 
ice and just provides overall just a
better<00:01:20.400> layer<00:01:20.700> better<00:01:21.060> coating<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> water<00:01:21.830> so

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
better layer better coating of water so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.140 
better layer better coating of water so
in<00:01:22.920> order<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> provide<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.610> make<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.909> easy

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
in order to provide that make this easy

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.859 
in order to provide that make this easy
for<00:01:24.240> me<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.509> put<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.460> quick<00:01:26.460> connect<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
for me I put a quick connect on here so

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.270 
for me I put a quick connect on here so
this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> obviously<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> male<00:01:28.770> end<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
this is obviously the male end of the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.340 
this is obviously the male end of the
Quick<00:01:29.490> Connect<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> female

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
Quick Connect and then I have the female

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.390 
Quick Connect and then I have the female
end<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> quick<00:01:31.860> connector<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
end of the quick connector which is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.760 
end of the quick connector which is
sitting<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> garden<00:01:33.509> hose<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.079> should<00:01:34.710> do

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
sitting on a garden hose I should do

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890 
sitting on a garden hose I should do
keep<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> garden<00:01:35.310> hose<00:01:35.490> half<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.420> outside

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
keep the garden hose half of it outside

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.510 
keep the garden hose half of it outside
because<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.619> don't<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> haul<00:01:38.070> hoses

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
because I don't want to haul hoses

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.620 
because I don't want to haul hoses
through<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> house<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> clear

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
through the house then I have a clear

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
through the house then I have a clear
compressor<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.680> which<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.100> blow<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
compressor for which I then blow all the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.730 
compressor for which I then blow all the
water<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.350> done<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
water out of it when I'm done with the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 
water out of it when I'm done with the
process<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.210> allows<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.689> stay

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
process and then that allows it to stay

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.480 
process and then that allows it to stay
outside<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> hall<00:01:47.220> things

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
outside and now if the hall things

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
outside and now if the hall things
around<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:47.909> that's<00:01:48.060> obviously<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.810> your

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
around but that's obviously up to your

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.490 
around but that's obviously up to your
discretion

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
discretion

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.370 
discretion
so<00:01:50.430> start<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.180> basically<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.689> female

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
so start this this is basically a female

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.499 
so start this this is basically a female
threaded<00:01:52.740> three-quarter<00:01:53.490> inch<00:01:53.700> coupling

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
threaded three-quarter inch coupling

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.510 
threaded three-quarter inch coupling
right<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.250> cut<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> small

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
right here and then I just cut a small

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.789 
right here and then I just cut a small
piece<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.390> know<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
piece and then you know with the just a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
piece and then you know with the just a
PVC<00:01:59.100> adhesive<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> cleaning

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
PVC adhesive you know as a cleaning

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
PVC adhesive you know as a cleaning
compound<00:02:01.439> which<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.740> purple<00:02:02.070> residue

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
compound which is that purple residue

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160 
compound which is that purple residue
you'll<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.600> there's<00:02:03.869> obviously

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you'll see and then there's obviously

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.499 
you'll see and then there's obviously
the<00:02:04.560> adhesive<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:05.729> I've<00:02:05.939> seated<00:02:06.390> these

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the adhesive so now I've seated these

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.080 
the adhesive so now I've seated these
two<00:02:06.719> together<00:02:07.009> this<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.190> teed<00:02:08.489> off<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:08.940> no

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
two together this is teed off for no

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
two together this is teed off for no
particular<00:02:09.660> reason<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.979> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
particular reason at all this just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.730 
particular reason at all this just
basically<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> piece<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.510> I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
basically is a piece that I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.440 
basically is a piece that I
as<00:02:12.800> sitting<00:02:13.130> around<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.490> could<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:13.820> use<00:02:14.420> a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
as sitting around you could just use a

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.120 
as sitting around you could just use a
straight<00:02:14.810> Union<00:02:15.170> connection<00:02:15.650> as<00:02:15.740> well<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.070> you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
straight Union connection as well to you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.820 
straight Union connection as well to you
and<00:02:16.340> bypass<00:02:16.850> all<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.960> okay

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and bypass all this okay

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.740 
and bypass all this okay
this<00:02:19.460> then<00:02:19.670> runs<00:02:19.940> against<00:02:20.270> another<00:02:20.420> small

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
this then runs against another small

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.410 
this then runs against another small
portion<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.230> PVC<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:21.980> then<00:02:22.670> straight<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.090> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
portion of PVC and then straight on to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.390 
portion of PVC and then straight on to
my<00:02:23.540> ball<00:02:23.870> valve<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.590> allows<00:02:24.830> me<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.010> temper

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
my ball valve this allows me to temper

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.450 
my ball valve this allows me to temper
the<00:02:25.490> amount<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.730> water<00:02:25.910> coming<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.540> out

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
the amount of water coming in and out

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.670 
the amount of water coming in and out
runs<00:02:28.460> straight<00:02:28.910> down<00:02:29.150> through<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:30.260> an<00:02:30.380> elbow

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
runs straight down through to an elbow

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.290 
runs straight down through to an elbow
right<00:02:30.710> here<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:32.600> table<00:02:32.780> will<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.080> goes<00:02:33.740> to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
right here this table will then goes to

here I look right here and there's one
over<00:03:25.670> here<00:03:25.970> which<00:03:26.240> just<00:03:26.480> kind<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.810> hangs<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.170> I

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
over here which just kind of hangs in I

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.750 
over here which just kind of hangs in I
just<00:03:27.380> again<00:03:27.830> just<00:03:27.860> drilled<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.340> very<00:03:28.520> small

just again just drilled a very small

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.880 
just again just drilled a very small
hole<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.420> thread<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.960> those<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:30.770> have

kind<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.690> up<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.050> off<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.590> then<00:03:46.130> on<00:03:46.280> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
kind of up and off and then on the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.680 
kind of up and off and then on the
backside<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.030> unit<00:03:48.730> you'll<00:03:49.730> see<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:49.910> series

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
backside of the unit you'll see a series

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.400 
backside of the unit you'll see a series
of<00:03:50.900> extremely<00:03:51.650> small<00:03:51.860> holes<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:53.200> mean<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.260> would

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
of extremely small holes I mean I would

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.750 
of extremely small holes I mean I would
say<00:03:54.440> there<00:03:54.830> may<00:03:55.340> be<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.850> sixteenth<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.720> an<00:03:56.840> inch

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
say there may be a sixteenth of an inch

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.760 
say there may be a sixteenth of an inch
32nd<00:03:58.760> of<00:03:58.790> an<00:03:58.880> inch<00:04:00.910> in<00:04:01.910> diameter<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.590> ran<00:04:03.740> a

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
32nd of an inch in diameter and I ran a

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.580 
32nd of an inch in diameter and I ran a
bunch<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.070> them<00:04:04.250> my<00:04:04.490> only<00:04:04.670> advice<00:04:04.820> is<00:04:05.000> do<00:04:05.870> very

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
bunch of them my only advice is do very

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.690 
bunch of them my only advice is do very
small<00:04:06.980> holes<00:04:07.780> do<00:04:08.780> many<00:04:09.350> of<00:04:09.530> them<00:04:09.740> but<00:04:10.520> again

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
small holes do many of them but again

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.310 
small holes do many of them but again
you<00:04:11.030> can<00:04:11.180> always<00:04:11.360> drill<00:04:11.720> larger<00:04:12.140> if<00:04:12.230> you're

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
you can always drill larger if you're

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.600 
you can always drill larger if you're
not<00:04:12.440> getting<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.709> water<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.070> need<00:04:13.190> but<00:04:13.430> I

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
think you know a little bit goes a long

way I'm learning in this whole process
that<00:04:17.359> it's<00:04:17.570> definitely<00:04:17.799> been<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:19.400> win<00:04:19.640> is<00:04:19.910> what

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
that it's definitely been to win is what
