00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.580
 a weapons game for you is that 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.020
 but I believe here the day belongs 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.610
 no magic I have just come back 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.620
 I had a few problems and I want that 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.570
 Get rid of short statement about black ops 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.890
 2 some of you are worried 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.510
 made if synonymous then videos come 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.310
 Of course, then synonymous videos come 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.649
 however, I have a few of them 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.850
 technical problems to the mystery of the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.200
 you have to you do not mind the wars 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.110
 I attacked again so it will be 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.660
 Definitely more videos to follow 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.309
 but it is not going to be any sooner 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.950
 opinion or something else to hear from me 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.050

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.610

 dared wildhaus and you must here 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.259
 Advertise but I thought we would 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.320
 do that a bit differently now 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.670
 and it's easy you have and in 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.990

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.640
 I'll see you in the video now too 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.600
 So I'll have to explain 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.909
 and then go into the description 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.740
 it is quite simple yes when I am at 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.330

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.540
 History asks then comes to mine 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.080

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.370
 and if you do not know what something t 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.720
 it 's a description that's how 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.280
 Skype to communicate 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.500
 you can download the package auto 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.260
 and link in the description and then 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.940
 can you use that as well? 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.770
 then you come over we sit at 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.480
 We do not rebuild a channel monument 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.490
 We'll do that to you then 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.860
 maybe a little something and ask 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.080
 to prepare for it you should beforehand 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.430
 before this step 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.810
 below in the description it says in 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.700
 the right order I am 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.920
 just a bit fatal is not 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.960
 You should just be so wild 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.010
 prepare for this you have the normal 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.900
 application form below 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.610
 that should look at you there once 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.840
 a little bit to think about what they are there 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.430
 would say live and you have a 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.550
 little to ask 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.760
 and if we like that I like it and 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.820
 miro or us says then you come for 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.440
 another step so you are 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.030
 then in the shortlist if that's us 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.830
 liked what you told us so 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.630
 So tell us a little bit about how 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.890
 You said you have the link where I am 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.300
 can do some whats where I come from 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.910
 You can prepare a bit with that 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.140
 conversation you can say you have seen him in 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.730
 the description we chat a 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.980
 little and if we liked that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.739
 what we have heard so then times then 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.450
 there is another choice as I said 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.910
 on the side in the narrower selection procedure so 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.769
 you can call it and then if you 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.850
 to apply again is a bit tighter 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.080
 that a little bit something 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.120
 other then apply again 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.709
 and then when the chances are very good 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.600
 she comes in the clear there is 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.980
 No criteria comes so all 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.459
 open the as you all on the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.260

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.690
 Prepare all of you, we'll talk to you 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.870
 everyone and the thing starts from that 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.720
 video online I think so until 22 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.730
 This will be the evening at 11 pm 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.830
 after that, I'll think about it tomorrow 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.269
 and sunday from 10 o'clock in the morning we will 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.560

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.380
 I will be online 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.560
 but it would only be online with those 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.349
 I hope you can talk 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.849

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.810
