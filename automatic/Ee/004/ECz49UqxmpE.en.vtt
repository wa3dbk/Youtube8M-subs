the actual link on there although that
wouldn't<00:03:03.180> make<00:03:03.299> much<00:03:03.480> sense<00:03:03.540> because<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
wouldn't make much sense because the

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.390 
wouldn't make much sense because the
battery<00:03:04.349> would<00:03:04.470> eventually<00:03:04.799> die<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.040> don't

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
and you won't have to worry about it

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.390 
and you won't have to worry about it
slipping<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.129> that's<00:04:08.250> really<00:04:08.489> nice<00:04:08.609> oh<00:04:10.400> look

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
slipping so that's really nice oh look

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.270 
slipping so that's really nice oh look
like<00:04:11.519> I<00:04:11.609> turned<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:11.940> on<00:04:12.199> alright<00:04:13.199> well<00:04:13.349> so<00:04:14.129> much

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
like I turned it on alright well so much

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.909 
like I turned it on alright well so much
for<00:04:14.549> charging<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.299> before<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.750> put<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.320> looks

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
for charging it before you put it looks

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.259 
for charging it before you put it looks
like<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.250> nuke<00:04:17.459> has<00:04:17.609> turned<00:04:17.880> itself<00:04:18.090> on

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
like the nuke has turned itself on

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.009 
like the nuke has turned itself on
somehow<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:19.019> don't<00:04:19.560> know<00:04:19.709> what<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:19.859> press<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:21.019> the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
somehow I don't know what I press on the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.800 
somehow I don't know what I press on the
side<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.349> don't<00:04:22.380> really<00:04:22.919> have<00:04:23.039> anything<00:04:23.280> and

on<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.050> very<00:04:25.349> top<00:04:25.650> you've<00:04:26.039> got

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.830 

the<00:04:29.860> power<00:04:30.670> button<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.180> these<00:04:31.480> two<00:04:31.690> little

the power button and these two little
tabs<00:04:32.080> right<00:04:32.320> here<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.770> don't<00:04:32.950> know<00:04:33.010> if<00:04:33.100> that's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
tabs right here I don't know if that's

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.120 
tabs right here I don't know if that's
for<00:04:33.520> something<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:35.440> an<00:04:35.500> attachment<00:04:35.770> maybe

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
for something for an attachment maybe

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.100 
for something for an attachment maybe
certain<00:04:36.850> cases<00:04:37.060> or<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.660> know<00:04:37.840> they<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.080> a

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
certain cases or I know they have a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.570 
certain cases or I know they have a
light<00:04:38.350> attachment<00:04:38.920> maybe<00:04:39.070> had<00:04:39.220> something<00:04:39.430> to

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
light attachment maybe had something to

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.690 
light attachment maybe had something to
do<00:04:39.730> with<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:41.380> of<00:04:42.160> course<00:04:42.190> on<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.550> side

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
do with that and of course on this side

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.190 
do with that and of course on this side
nothing<00:04:42.970> again<00:04:45.540> so<00:04:46.540> there<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:46.840> that's<00:04:47.020> the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
nothing again so there it is that's the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.000 
nothing again so there it is that's the
actual<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.740> Inc<00:04:47.920> as<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.910> can<00:04:49.030> see<00:04:49.740> your<00:04:50.740> nook<00:04:50.890> is

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
actual I Inc as you can see your nook is

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.200 
actual I Inc as you can see your nook is
starting<00:04:51.340> up<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.700> its<00:04:51.910> really<00:04:51.940> interesting

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
starting up and its really interesting

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.210 
starting up and its really interesting
it's<00:04:52.600> actually<00:04:52.930> not<00:04:53.320> backlit<00:04:53.590> of<00:04:53.890> course<00:04:54.100> so

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
it's actually not backlit of course so

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.270 
it's actually not backlit of course so
you<00:04:54.280> need<00:04:54.520> light<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:55.000> read<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:56.070> if<00:04:57.070> we<00:04:57.160> go

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
you need light to read it so if we go

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.230 
you need light to read it so if we go
ahead<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:57.490> turn<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.820> light<00:04:57.970> down<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.820> it's

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
ahead and turn the light down so it's

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.210 
ahead and turn the light down so it's
still<00:05:04.420> enough<00:05:04.540> light<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.780> read<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.200> but<00:05:05.410> you

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
still enough light to read it but you

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.650 
still enough light to read it but you
can't<00:05:06.460> read<00:05:06.610> this<00:05:06.730> in<00:05:06.880> complete<00:05:07.120> darkness<00:05:07.360> so

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
can't read this in complete darkness so

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.730 
can't read this in complete darkness so
you're<00:05:07.870> going<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.050> need<00:05:08.170> some<00:05:08.350> kind<00:05:08.530> of<00:05:08.590> light

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
you're going to need some kind of light

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.280 
you're going to need some kind of light
if<00:05:08.920> you<00:05:09.070> want<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.310> read<00:05:09.490> it<00:05:09.670> in<00:05:09.790> the<00:05:10.060> dark<00:05:10.290> so

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
if you want to read it in the dark so

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.200 
if you want to read it in the dark so
that's<00:05:11.470> something<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.770> note<00:05:12.040> rather<00:05:12.610> than<00:05:12.730> LCD

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
that's something to note rather than LCD

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.850 
that's something to note rather than LCD
which<00:05:13.480> is<00:05:13.630> backlit<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:14.290> you<00:05:14.530> know<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.710> could

which is backlit and you know you could
read<00:05:14.920> in<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.130> dark<00:05:15.400> wherever<00:05:15.730> you<00:05:15.820> want<00:05:16.000> but<00:05:16.600> if

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
read in a dark wherever you want but if

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.060 
read in a dark wherever you want but if
you're<00:05:16.960> reading<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.320> in<00:05:17.470> direct<00:05:17.830> light

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
you're reading it in direct light

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.920 
you're reading it in direct light
eating's<00:05:18.940> definitely<00:05:19.300> gonna<00:05:19.390> be<00:05:19.480> better<00:05:19.690> for
