fruit and flower has proven to be
effective<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.860> eliminating<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.879> food<00:03:06.120> source

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
effective in eliminating a food source

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.420 
effective in eliminating a food source
for<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.810> moth<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.920> only<00:03:08.099> food

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
for this moth really the only food

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.160 
for this moth really the only food
source<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.790> European<00:03:09.329> grape<00:03:09.510> by<00:03:09.660> moth<00:03:09.900> has

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
source that European grape by moth has

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.559 
source that European grape by moth has
so<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.160> we<00:03:11.280> all<00:03:11.459> work<00:03:11.730> together<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.450> can

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
so if we all work together we can

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.380 
so if we all work together we can
continue<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.829> fact<00:03:14.040> eradicate<00:03:14.790> European

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
continue and in fact eradicate European

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.509
