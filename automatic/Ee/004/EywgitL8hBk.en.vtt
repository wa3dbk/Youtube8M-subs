00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi this is sarah today a video 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.210
 is there is an enarque is quite chic 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.519
 you will need only three colors of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 the year of the black of the gray and the white for 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.540
 I used stickers 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.190
 silvery but you will need but no 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 color if you do not like it 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.859
 do not hesitate to like the video or even 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.359
 leave a nice little comment and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.260
 I let you watch the video 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.519
 left then we'll start by inviting 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.510
 white me it's brand and we have 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.580
 only 21 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 you have to apply two layers to your 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.800
 first run the second layer and the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.260
 right hand 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
 suddenly the left hand of gold layers 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.680
 that's what it gives you ate 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 two colors of black and white 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 you give a gray mouse 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.600
 black is the same it's all 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 me and only 80 ter to for the noise 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.680
 you will apply it in the middle to little 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.260
 near the shadow inches down that 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 upward walk way of you see 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.649
 very well on the picture 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.649
 gold for the technique it's very simple 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.379
 you pat on the one you do not shoot 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 you tapping it will be simpler and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.619
 that's roof are not need of them precise 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 you see very well that I am 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.729
 enjoyed at all then you go 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.799
 take the character number it's anwar 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.710
 rare is all me and you go 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.159
 put it at the level of the cuticles at the bottom 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.280
 water under the gray was all the same 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.600
 technique by tapping to find out if they 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.670
 wish precise the besides I 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.000
 I'm really going to be overwhelmed to death but 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.000
 it is not serious 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.729
 we could see I'm not precise 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.500
 at all events I passed to death 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.860
 but after as power on the move 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.450
 i removed g with the solvent 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.369
 so here you go after 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.179
 destitute eat a little bit apart I took 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.939
 a silver sticker that's what it gives 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.149
 on my thumb to see that I exceeded 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.979
 but it's ok to manipulate the stickers 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.340
 and need a verizon and a forceps 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.890
 tweeze 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.140
 so for the technique of cycles to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.630
 you have to take the seeker to put it down 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.920
 on the nail is past your finger with 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.099
 the pass and spinning at the level of 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.150
 cuticles here i showed you sony the 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:13.340
 video how do you do that I take 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.760
 a step back and I'm painting it for 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.200
 it fits in actually ursins I 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.560
 believe it's useful at the level of 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.319
 but I really remember and now talk 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.950
 you're going to do it with a sticker at 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.599
 level of the gray and white slats at 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.579
 the time I did the least but 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.680
 oblivion and we do the same here it is 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.840
 the same technique opposed on good you 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.840
 go to the level of the cuticles and that's it 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.030
 then to put your scissors 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.250
 you 're going to take is cut off which 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.230
 Exceeds it's a bit complicated but I have 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.819
 do both at the same time so there may 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.120
 see that the scissors will soon fall 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.650
 because like that and that's it's hard 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.549
 since my other hands pockets all 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.239
 a massage so here I am trying to cut 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.129
 somehow what goes beyond 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.650
 with tapas epilator you will take the 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.689
 pieces of stickers that was cut off and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.250
 took them simply because 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.659
 summer finger it's complicated when you 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.359
 go take a brush from the president to 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.370
 this step is optional if you have 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.250
 overtaking you did it or not 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.169
 depends on your level 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.200
 at the level of nail art I arrive 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.700
 easily handle the paintbrushes of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.260
 precision on the other hand if you can not arrive 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.430
 not to handle a precision brush 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.349
 you do not do 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.299
 because if you put varnish on 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.030
 ethics to make it very very ugly and 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.699
 as much as they like a little bit of 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.780
 walnut or a little bit gray looks there 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.780
 frankly it will be ugly 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.190
 there we are at 100 top coat now I 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.629
 will put him on the tape coach will put 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.159
 two shots tokens code yes I know that 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.470
 do a lot but you do not have to 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.680
 have consented the stickers or our 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.680
 finger 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.689
 so when it's the express more shakes 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.920
 retained an ultimate of maybelline by a 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.799
 day a left peak as I said 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.660
 previously and for the technique it 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.750
 you really have to put a big fat 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.519
 drop or not that there is black on the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.020
 gray of the bed on the blog because that at 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.580
 to do otherwise to be and it's going to be very 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.199
 very ugly because the road chief 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.660
 three colors and it's these different 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:33.160
 that lead one each color 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.509
 this video is over spacca you 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.340
 will have pleased and as usual I will 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.090
 do standards bevel and see you soon 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.449
 for a new video 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.449
 ciao
