when I do children's forums I like to

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.160 
when I do children's forums I like to
use<00:00:21.400> parts<00:00:21.970> of<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.270> room<00:00:22.450> that<00:00:22.869> aren't

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
use parts of the room that aren't

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.320 
use parts of the room that aren't
typically<00:00:23.619> considered<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.610> be<00:00:24.730> part<00:00:25.029> of<00:00:25.180> the

typically considered to be part of the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.250 
typically considered to be part of the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
design to create interactive elements

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.580 
design to create interactive elements
that<00:00:29.500> I<00:00:29.560> call<00:00:29.890> yes<00:00:30.220> factors<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:31.300> a<00:00:31.840> yes<00:00:32.080> factor

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
that I call yes factors and a yes factor

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.830 
that I call yes factors and a yes factor
is<00:00:32.800> just<00:00:33.160> something<00:00:33.610> that<00:00:33.640> your<00:00:33.970> child<00:00:34.420> can

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
is just something that your child can

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.549 
is just something that your child can
use<00:00:35.320> can<00:00:36.220> play<00:00:36.640> with<00:00:37.000> in<00:00:37.690> a<00:00:37.900> different<00:00:38.110> way

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
use can play with in a different way

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.460 
use can play with in a different way
than<00:00:39.250> what<00:00:39.430> it<00:00:39.550> was<00:00:39.670> intended<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.239> be<00:00:40.390> one<00:00:41.379> of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
than what it was intended to be one of

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.740 
than what it was intended to be one of
my<00:00:41.530> favorite<00:00:41.980> things<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.340> do<00:00:42.640> is<00:00:42.879> to<00:00:43.570> take

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
my favorite things to do is to take

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.880 
my favorite things to do is to take
doors<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.589> cover<00:00:45.339> them<00:00:45.640> in<00:00:45.909> magnetic<00:00:46.890> paint

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
doors and cover them in magnetic paint

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.820 
doors and cover them in magnetic paint
now<00:00:48.879> magnetic<00:00:49.360> paint<00:00:49.629> is<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:50.140> little<00:00:50.500> tricky<00:00:50.799> to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
now magnetic paint is a little tricky to

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.640 
now magnetic paint is a little tricky to
work<00:00:51.040> with<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.820> is<00:00:52.030> actually<00:00:52.239> just<00:00:52.839> ground-up

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
work with it is actually just ground-up

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.430 
work with it is actually just ground-up
bits<00:00:53.979> of<00:00:54.220> metal<00:00:54.430> in<00:00:54.790> a<00:00:55.030> solution<00:00:55.420> that<00:00:56.229> you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
bits of metal in a solution that you

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.520 
bits of metal in a solution that you
slather<00:00:57.010> on<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.610> surface<00:00:58.269> so<00:00:58.870> doors<00:00:59.170> work

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
slather on a surface so doors work

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.200 
slather on a surface so doors work
better<00:00:59.739> than<00:00:59.949> walls<00:01:00.220> because<00:01:00.879> they're

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
better than walls because they're

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.930 
better than walls because they're
smoother<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.320> if<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.470> have<00:01:02.680> an<00:01:02.860> on<00:01:03.070> panel<00:01:03.640> door

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
smoother so if you have an on panel door

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.870 
smoother so if you have an on panel door
that's<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.420> best<00:01:04.659> I<00:01:04.989> like<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.799> put<00:01:06.010> to<00:01:06.250> really

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
that's the best I like to put to really

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.570 
that's the best I like to put to really
gloppy<00:01:07.270> heavy<00:01:07.720> coats<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.500> then<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.190> have<00:01:09.400> to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
gloppy heavy coats and then you have to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.490 
gloppy heavy coats and then you have to
cover<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:09.940> with<00:01:10.210> another<00:01:10.540> color<00:01:10.840> because<00:01:11.110> it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
cover it with another color because it's

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.390 
cover it with another color because it's
this<00:01:11.770> horrible<00:01:12.250> dark<00:01:12.549> grey<00:01:12.880> iron<00:01:13.270> color<00:01:13.869> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
this horrible dark grey iron color and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.740 
this horrible dark grey iron color and
another<00:01:15.400> thing<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.850> remember<00:01:16.090> when<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.539> use

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
another thing to remember when you use

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.510 
another thing to remember when you use
surfaces<00:01:17.380> like<00:01:17.619> this<00:01:17.829> is<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.159> magnetic

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
surfaces like this is the magnetic

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.029 
surfaces like this is the magnetic
paints<00:01:19.030> not<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:19.450> good<00:01:19.659> as<00:01:19.810> an<00:01:19.930> actual<00:01:20.500> metal

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
paints not as good as an actual metal

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.730 
paints not as good as an actual metal
door<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.479> magnets<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.049> you<00:01:23.140> use<00:01:23.439> should

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
door so the magnets that you use should

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.039 
door so the magnets that you use should
be<00:01:23.799> lightweight<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.030> like<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.570> use<00:01:25.750> like

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
be lightweight so I like to use like

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.679 
be lightweight so I like to use like
these<00:01:26.229> foam<00:01:26.649> letters<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.090> found<00:01:28.509> at

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
these foam letters that I found at

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.389 
these foam letters that I found at
alerting<00:01:29.109> supply<00:01:29.530> store<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:29.950> could<00:01:30.219> probably

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
alerting supply store you could probably

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.760 
alerting supply store you could probably
get<00:01:30.789> them<00:01:30.939> online<00:01:31.119> they're<00:01:31.539> solid<00:01:32.170> magnet<00:01:32.619> on

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
get them online they're solid magnet on

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.340 
get them online they're solid magnet on
the<00:01:32.799> back<00:01:33.009> so<00:01:33.340> they<00:01:33.460> stick<00:01:33.789> really<00:01:34.000> well<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:34.719> I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
the back so they stick really well and I

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.669 
the back so they stick really well and I
also<00:01:35.560> like<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.130> use<00:01:36.299> interactive<00:01:37.299> toys<00:01:37.689> that

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
also like to use interactive toys that

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.169 
also like to use interactive toys that
your<00:01:38.859> kids<00:01:39.130> can<00:01:39.340> put<00:01:39.520> on<00:01:39.609> a<00:01:39.640> vertical<00:01:39.909> surface

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
your kids can put on a vertical surface

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.749 
your kids can put on a vertical surface
and<00:01:40.749> use<00:01:40.869> it<00:01:40.990> away<00:01:41.200> they're<00:01:41.380> not<00:01:41.530> expecting<00:01:42.130> so

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
and use it away they're not expecting so

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.300 
and use it away they're not expecting so
for<00:01:42.969> example<00:01:43.329> I<00:01:43.450> have<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:43.749> wooden<00:01:44.109> puzzle<00:01:44.469> or

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
for example I have this wooden puzzle or

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.120 
for example I have this wooden puzzle or
somebody<00:01:45.640> lost<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.119> Z<00:01:46.329> so<00:01:47.259> just<00:01:47.499> stick<00:01:47.829> a

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
somebody lost the Z so just stick a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.609 
somebody lost the Z so just stick a
magnet<00:01:48.729> on<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.090> back<00:01:49.299> of<00:01:49.539> it<00:01:49.689> now<00:01:50.289> because

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
magnet on the back of it now because

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.260 
magnet on the back of it now because
this<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.159> wood<00:01:51.369> you're<00:01:51.579> gonna<00:01:51.670> have<00:01:51.969> to<00:01:52.119> use<00:01:52.240> a

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
this is wood you're gonna have to use a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.239 
this is wood you're gonna have to use a
heavier<00:01:52.719> magnet<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.439> can<00:01:53.740> buy<00:01:53.920> those<00:01:54.189> in

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
heavier magnet and you can buy those in

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.520 
heavier magnet and you can buy those in
packages<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.270> got<00:01:55.450> these<00:01:55.630> at<00:01:55.840> Michael's<00:01:56.229> arts

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
packages I got these at Michael's arts

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.609 
packages I got these at Michael's arts
and<00:01:56.740> crafts<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:58.509> hot<00:01:58.929> glue<00:01:58.960> one<00:01:59.530> of

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
and crafts you just hot glue one of

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.770 
and crafts you just hot glue one of
these<00:01:59.740> onto<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.280> back<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.729> it's<00:02:01.359> ready<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.689> go

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
these onto the back and it's ready to go

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.169 
these onto the back and it's ready to go
and<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.710> can<00:02:02.920> interact<00:02:03.219> with<00:02:03.670> whatever<00:02:03.999> your

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
and it can interact with whatever your

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.510 
and it can interact with whatever your
child<00:02:04.450> draws<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:05.109> the<00:02:05.140> surface<00:02:05.649> if<00:02:06.039> you<00:02:06.340> want

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
child draws on the surface if you want

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.100 
child draws on the surface if you want
to<00:02:06.609> use<00:02:06.729> removable<00:02:07.569> paint<00:02:07.810> whatever

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
to use removable paint whatever

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.400 
to use removable paint whatever
removable<00:02:08.920> markers<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.399> should<00:02:09.610> say<00:02:10.110> these<00:02:11.110> are
