00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 then the magpies sure it makes it possible to realize 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.990
 loops on thoronet ropes 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.490
 like this one we do it on the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.820
 moorings of large boats or on our 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.250
 clean up so we can also 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.839
 do with a metal case that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.170
 limits wear 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.090
 when you hit them on a shackle 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 so lepi on has the reputation of being a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.359
 cloud a little bit complicated to do 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.460
 but I will show you a method 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.480
 any simple that will allow you to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 make them easy 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.460
 the first thing to do is to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 release the three bulls here and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.600
 now i'm going to start my 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 splicing by helping me with a small tool 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.710
 that's called an evening spike that's going to me 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.190
 allow to bring bulls into 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.530
 the rope itself we start with 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.550
 make the loop to the length that we 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.520
 wants and I'll have the three 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.420
 bulls so that they cross the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.039
 bulls from the rope to the perpendicular 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.039
 and I'll start with the middle one 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.970
 here and with the evening tracks so I 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.970
 will go under a torrent 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.579
 here and so the middle brown they 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.579
 spend in the evening ear the subs will have 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.730
 here is now I can release my spur 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.980
 evening and then after we have to remember 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.140
 that where comes the bull that I come 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.640
 to pass in the next is the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.890
 next we always take the one that is 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.729
 on the left and it's the same thing 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.729
 in the evening spike 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.500
 here I am withdrawing my efi tonight so here 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.180
 there I spent two bulls out of three 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.159
 to make the first pass it remains to 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.159
 get the last bull so the one 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:12.539
 that I spent spell here so the next 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.539
 whoever is on the left will enter here 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.350
 here is always I always place it 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.350
 in the same way 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.270
 here 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.849
 so here I made a first pass in 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:39.090
 putting my three bulls so after 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.170
 we serve a little bit and I will check 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.720
 that I was not mistaken looking 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.060
 above my book there and you 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.569
 see the narrow will they come out well 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.980
 in regular star there are not two 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.819
 who touch each other well they are 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.250
 very regular so in fact it works by 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.340
 groups of three a passage this is the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.870
 passage of three bulls so once 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.109
 that we made the first pass we can 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 start with any 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.909
 so I'll take this one by 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.349
 example and so they spend on a 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.349
 bull and ir below each other 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.470
 here and we always go in the same 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470
 meaning 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.150
 So here I am, I just finished 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:36.299
 passing the three bulls the second 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.299
 passage I am serving 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.020
 here and I check that I'm always 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.640
 well with a regular star but 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.500
 three bulls coming out so 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.230
 regular 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.650
 so here's the spike on finishing the minimum 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.700
 his three passes of 3 will have here I 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.120
 did four to make it more 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.120
 aesthetic
