wall observe that now when the bathroom
tissue<00:01:44.840> sinks<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:46.159> needle<00:01:46.610> sinks<00:01:47.179> -<00:01:48.490> why<00:01:49.490> do

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
tissue sinks the needle sinks - why do

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.050 
tissue sinks the needle sinks - why do
you<00:01:49.729> think<00:01:49.819> this<00:01:50.179> happens<00:01:51.039> the<00:01:52.039> soap<00:01:52.369> reduces

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
you think this happens the soap reduces

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.090 
you think this happens the soap reduces
the<00:01:53.240> water<00:01:53.420> surface<00:01:54.170> tension<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:54.679> that<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
the water surface tension so that the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.309 
the water surface tension so that the
water<00:01:55.459> can<00:01:55.640> no<00:01:55.969> longer<00:01:56.270> support<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.899> needle

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
water can no longer support the needle

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.919 
water can no longer support the needle
this<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.950> why<00:01:58.130> soap<00:01:58.520> works<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.060> effectively<00:01:59.630> to

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
this is why soap works so effectively to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.200 
this is why soap works so effectively to
clean
