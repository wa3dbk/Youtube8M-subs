00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.960
 it's normal it's always amazing I think 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.660
 that the events that in monterrey 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.059
 burned but in the year that I'm going to 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 find me like with many bands already 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.050
 be from Mexico other sides that always 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.300
 here I would see the best there is no 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.129
 opportunity to see them then in 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.720
 this festival parents like the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.360
 diversity do not play after a band 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.640
 slot but such a cool thing is that the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.129
 people pay attention to you I do not think it 's 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.600
 as the good answer turns down and 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.579
 they are like that 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.900
 and suddenly he gathered like a little 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.450
 more people 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.400
 10 it seems to me vacant that they have bands 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.510
 from different parts of the world that 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.510
 have new ones 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 I find very good the place where 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 is 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.370
 especially the poster is interesting 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.810
 they are high gold projects do not usually see 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.020
 in other festivals 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.310
 I think the most interesting thing seems to me 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.310
 much more risky 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 bands 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.340
 it seems a lot 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.950
 amazing the super relaxed a very 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.500
 good opportunity to come and meet 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.840
 music or see artists that you like 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.750
 close is amazing after very well 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.300
 organized when you have girls 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.340
 good chatting because it really is 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.190
 being very risky very daring and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.560
 is betting on new bands 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.660
 by bands that really have 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.520
 very fresh proposals 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.770
 Well, I think it's a pretty festival 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.800
 well organized that has been growing with 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.020
 time and he's pretty much kid 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.120
 take out bands that are playing well 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.520
 but they bring good material and good 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.820
 idea and I think it's good support for the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.550
 People who know each other better 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.060
 organized good fun and a location 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.060
 of a cyber 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.820
 before Mexican standardization of the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.820
 suspenders
