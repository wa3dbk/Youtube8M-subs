different styles of CAP touch we've got

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
different styles of CAP touch we've got
a<00:01:02.550> slider<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.390> which<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
a slider here which you can see as I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.530 
a slider here which you can see as I
slide<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:04.949> finger<00:01:05.159> over<00:01:05.519> will<00:01:05.820> light<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> LEDs

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
slide my finger over will light the LEDs

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
slide my finger over will light the LEDs
based<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> position<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> where<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> am<00:01:08.970> on

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
based on the position of where I am on

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.080 
based on the position of where I am on
the<00:01:09.299> slider<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.100> how<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> works<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.760> uses

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the slider and how that works is it uses

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.450 
the slider and how that works is it uses
two<00:01:12.270> separate<00:01:12.659> elements<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
two separate elements and then the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
two separate elements and then the
software<00:01:14.850> detects<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.960> percentage

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
software detects you know the percentage

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390 
software detects you know the percentage
of<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:16.830> much<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.189> am<00:01:17.630> covering<00:01:18.630> each<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.400> this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.210 
to our award winning metal over camp
demonstrator<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:18.230> difference<00:02:18.590> between<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
demonstrator the difference between the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.670 
demonstrator the difference between the
technologies<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.690> metal<00:02:20.930> over<00:02:21.020> camp<00:02:21.440> is

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
technologies of the metal over camp is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.520 
technologies of the metal over camp is
instead<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.400> measuring<00:02:23.030> my<00:02:23.270> presence<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
instead of measuring my presence in the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.190 
instead of measuring my presence in the
capacitive<00:02:25.160> field<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.819> actually<00:02:26.480> uses

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
capacitive field it actually uses

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.050 
capacitive field it actually uses
distance<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.340> actually<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.790> able<00:02:28.910> to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
distance so it actually is able to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.870 
distance so it actually is able to
determine<00:02:30.050> how<00:02:30.440> hard<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:31.100> press<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.850> each

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
determine how hard I press on each

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.690 
determine how hard I press on each
button<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:33.050> won't<00:02:33.200> activate<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.310> LED

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
button and it won't activate the the LED

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.580 
button and it won't activate the the LED
and<00:02:35.030> make<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.360> sound<00:02:35.569> until<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:35.930> actually<00:02:36.230> put

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
and make the sound until I actually put

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.300 
and make the sound until I actually put
pressure<00:02:36.860> on<00:02:37.100> it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
pressure on it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400 
pressure on it
so<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.000> benefit<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.720> technology<00:02:39.080> is

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
so the benefit of that technology is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.940 
so the benefit of that technology is
that<00:02:39.560> makes<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.280> application<00:02:41.709> able<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.830> be

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
that makes the application able to be

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.100 
that makes the application able to be
totally<00:02:43.340> sealed<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.030> washable<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.900> makes

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
totally sealed and washable and it makes

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.059 
totally sealed and washable and it makes
it<00:02:45.230> very<00:02:45.290> very<00:02:45.530> robust<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.510> last

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
it very very robust the last

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.080 
it very very robust the last
demonstrator<00:02:49.069> we'll<00:02:49.250> take<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.459> look<00:02:49.700> at<00:02:49.790> today

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
demonstrator we'll take a look at today

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.050 
demonstrator we'll take a look at today
is<00:02:50.120> our<00:02:50.540> projective<00:02:51.290> capacitive

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
is our projective capacitive

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
is our projective capacitive
demonstration<00:02:53.060> this<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.510> three<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.930> half

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
demonstration this is a three and a half

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.979 
demonstration this is a three and a half
inch<00:02:54.350> touchscreen<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.400> as<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.420> would<00:02:56.540> expect

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
inch touchscreen and as you would expect

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.460 
inch touchscreen and as you would expect
in<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.830> touchscreen<00:02:58.160> application<00:02:59.290> we've<00:03:00.290> got

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
in a touchscreen application we've got

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.280 
in a touchscreen application we've got
the<00:03:00.650> graphics<00:03:01.640> underneath<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.360> our<00:03:02.780> solution

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
the graphics underneath and our solution

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.050 
the graphics underneath and our solution
will<00:03:03.440> actually<00:03:03.920> handle<00:03:04.580> up<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> two

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
will actually handle up the two

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.570 
will actually handle up the two
simultaneous<00:03:05.870> points<00:03:06.319> so<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.430> able<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.760> do

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
simultaneous points so it is able to do

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.699 
simultaneous points so it is able to do
manipulations<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.850> zoom<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.780> rotation<00:03:12.440> and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
manipulations of zoom and rotation and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.670 
manipulations of zoom and rotation and
the<00:03:13.549> controller<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.180> tracking<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:15.019> both<00:03:15.500> my

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
the controller is tracking up to both my

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.580 
the controller is tracking up to both my
finger<00:03:16.579> touches<00:03:16.940> at<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.269> point<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.410> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
finger touches at this point so the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.199 
finger touches at this point so the
