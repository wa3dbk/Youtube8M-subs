mild you lure anything for the switch
that<00:01:04.049> would<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.559> 401<00:01:05.519> -<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.969> slower<00:01:06.149> speed

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
that would be 401 - it's a slower speed

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.020 
that would be 401 - it's a slower speed
money<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:10.490> controllable<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.850> see

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
money it's very controllable you can see

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.789 
money it's very controllable you can see
how<00:01:12.149> slow<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:13.259> can<00:01:13.289> go

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.370 

I<00:01:21.799> run<00:01:22.729> these<00:01:22.850> motors<00:01:23.210> add<00:01:23.360> up<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.689> 100<00:01:24.110> volts

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
I run these motors add up to 100 volts

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.420 
I run these motors add up to 100 volts
and<00:01:25.450> 50<00:01:26.450> amps<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.380> would<00:01:27.619> recommend<00:01:27.799> the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
and 50 amps but I would recommend the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.999 
and 50 amps but I would recommend the
dual<00:01:28.579> speed<00:01:28.880> not<00:01:29.689> exceeding<00:01:30.170> 30<00:01:30.500> some<00:01:30.740> amps

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
dual speed not exceeding 30 some amps

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.580 
dual speed not exceeding 30 some amps
would<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.340> safe<00:01:31.490> mark<00:01:32.320> depending<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.409> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
would be the safe mark depending on the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.499 
would be the safe mark depending on the
weather<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.130> your<00:01:34.549> weight<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.000> how<00:01:35.360> much

the<00:01:42.220> two-speed<00:01:43.220> combination<00:01:43.729> allows<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.060> to

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
the two-speed combination allows you to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.940 
the two-speed combination allows you to
run<00:01:44.329> two<00:01:44.960> different<00:01:45.289> sized<00:01:45.409> wheels<00:01:45.649> or

inch wheel with a 20 inch wheel you want
to<00:01:53.179> run<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.450> 408<00:01:53.990> speed<00:01:54.530> because<00:01:54.799> it's<00:01:54.950> a

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
to run the 408 speed because it's a

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.160 
to run the 408 speed because it's a
faster<00:01:55.369> speed<00:01:55.459> and<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.209> larger<00:01:56.659> rim<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.049> would

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
faster speed and a larger rim you would

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.520 
faster speed and a larger rim you would
rather<00:01:57.349> go<00:01:58.250> with<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.399> 401<00:01:58.849> -<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.170> can<00:02:00.319> pick

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
rather go with the 401 - so you can pick

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.429 
rather go with the 401 - so you can pick
with<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.549> or<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:01.819> other<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.360> motor<00:02:02.569> has<00:02:02.869> two

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
with one or the other the motor has two

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.770 
with one or the other the motor has two
sets<00:02:03.709> of<00:02:03.950> power<00:02:04.729> leads<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.149> they're<00:02:05.599> labeled

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
sets of power leads and they're labeled

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.870 
sets of power leads and they're labeled
408<00:02:06.409> 401<00:02:07.340> -<00:02:07.459> and<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:08.479> single<00:02:08.780> set<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.019> halt<00:02:09.560> wires

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
408 401 - and a single set of halt wires

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.520 
408 401 - and a single set of halt wires
so<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:10.940> don't<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.840> use<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> dual<00:02:12.230> speed

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so you don't have to use a dual speed

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.259 
so you don't have to use a dual speed
controller<00:02:12.950> all<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.489> does<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.760> switch

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
controller all this does is switch

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.830 
controller all this does is switch
between<00:02:14.810> these<00:02:15.290> three<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.769> that<00:02:15.890> three<00:02:16.840> just

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
between these three and that three just

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.470 
between these three and that three just
a<00:02:17.900> big<00:02:18.049> toggle<00:02:18.380> switch<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.849> single<00:02:20.269> speed

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480

but<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.260> involves<00:03:18.819> some<00:03:19.819> you<00:03:20.060> know<00:03:20.349> making<00:03:21.349> it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
but it involves some you know making it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.550 
but it involves some you know making it
happen<00:03:21.560> kind<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.099> work<00:03:22.549> but<00:03:23.090> yeah<00:03:23.989> that's<00:03:24.349> a

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
happen kind of work but yeah that's a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.500 
happen kind of work but yeah that's a

out<00:03:50.080> there<00:03:50.260> crystallite<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.980> found<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:52.030> be<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
out there crystallite I found to be the

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.960 
out there crystallite I found to be the
most<00:03:52.330> quite<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:55.890> mean<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.010> hear<00:03:57.160> this<00:03:57.370> on<00:03:57.760> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
most quite I mean you hear this on the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.190 
most quite I mean you hear this on the
microphone<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.540> camera<00:03:58.900> because<00:03:59.049> we're

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
microphone of the camera because we're

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.869 
microphone of the camera because we're
in<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.379> sealed<00:03:59.620> room<00:03:59.860> we're<00:04:00.190> inside<00:04:00.519> and

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
in a sealed room we're inside and

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.789 
in a sealed room we're inside and
there's<00:04:01.540> no<00:04:01.690> rim<00:04:02.019> or<00:04:02.170> spokes<00:04:02.379> attached<00:04:02.650> to

there's no rim or spokes attached to

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.460 
there's no rim or spokes attached to
this<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.280> dampen<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.790> sound<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:07.470> found

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
this to dampen the sound of it I found

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.650 
this to dampen the sound of it I found
that<00:04:08.700> no<00:04:09.700> matter<00:04:09.849> what<00:04:10.090> voltage<00:04:10.269> you<00:04:10.510> run

that no matter what voltage you run

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.910 
that no matter what voltage you run
these<00:04:10.780> that<00:04:10.989> you'll<00:04:11.170> pass<00:04:11.410> by<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.709> pedestrian

they<00:04:12.400> won't<00:04:12.579> even<00:04:12.670> realize<00:04:13.120> there's<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.420> motor

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
they won't even realize there's a motor

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.650 
they won't even realize there's a motor
there<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.049> bite<00:04:15.000> compared<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.180> like<00:04:16.389> a<00:04:16.419> nine
