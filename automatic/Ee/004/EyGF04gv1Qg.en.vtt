00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.350 
instead of getting some get another
firing<00:02:25.709> system<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.490> only<00:02:27.120> have

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
firing system because I just only have

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.280 
firing system because I just only have
12<00:02:27.930> cues<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.440> my<00:02:28.530> firing<00:02:28.800> system<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.020> figured

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
