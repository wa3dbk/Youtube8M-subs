00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.400
 creating our own engine, we realized that 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.309
 can rewrite flow control 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 data to create games open 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.500
 In the world, we knew that Witcher 2 we 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.230
 lack of freedom of research game 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.779
 It was great but it was not huge 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.330
 Karpov this greatly restricted the player he 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.939
 moved along the plot and couldn't just 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.900
 escape and do something nice 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.630
 now players can explore the world 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.450
 as they may want to explore the plot 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.550
 as they want while working on 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.160
 witch paragraph b we discussed why not 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 insert the horse into the game we already 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.129
 could do it but the cards were too 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.620
 little cramped for a horse and we 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.300
 thought it would be cool if we put these 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.550
 mechanisms the next game is because 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.699
 fans constantly wrote on the forums that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.600
 the exit of Gera rides all horses 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.600
 called 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:12.030
 this is an important part of Nakam and we thought 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 it will be great to do this, we also play 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.759
 love open world rpg games but me 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.340
 It seems for example everything in our studio Gali 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.659
 in skyrim yes by the example of skyrim we understood 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.250
 one must be constantly maintained 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.220
 feeling of immersion in the game world is impossible 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 shows that the game has standard 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.970
 The moves and mechanisms of Skyrim are many 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.770
 of the same type 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.320
 you can take one task several times and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.360
 every time n essay doesn't know what you already 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.810
 did this job i think for immersion 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.659
 it is necessary that in each task 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.509
 about the character and reacted to yours 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.310
 actions and ad format arduinka 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.110
 this is why witcher 2 delays more 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.350
 because every solution has 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.920
 consequences and see how your actions 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.819
 change people's lives and you can discuss it 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.130
 and sometimes people are mad at you sometimes they 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.000
 happy with your actions but in any 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.640
 If you see these characters are alive 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.090
 real second problem speaking 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.069
 about Skyrim is that there like I already 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:35.599
 saying no bright characters I tried 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.260
 recall the five heroes of skyrim to name 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.860
 their names well could not plot too 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.180
 standard with world exploration all 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.650
 great and with this they missed 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.440
 need to learn in the wrong way 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.290
 how to make an open world how to transmit 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.870
 a sense of the open world how to create 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.180
 these magnificent landscapes and at the same time 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 fill the world with dungeons 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.900
 adventures I'm different other things 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.239
 if you combine all this with ours 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.170
 knowledge accumulated while working on 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.500
 past games 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.609
 it will turn out perfect in my opinion 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.760
 great landscapes 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.420
 wonderful places when you see them 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.510
 on the map 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.480
 you immediately want to go there 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.060
 look at them not particularly memorable 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.730
 one picture I finished the first episode 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.130
 I go out into the field and see the city seems 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.970
 whitran which is in the midst 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.250
 plains and you see these mountains far above 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.880
 them clouds and you have a feeling 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.920
 the fact that you are not huge understand 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.709
 the problem is how to combine these 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.170
 movie moment to the game were 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.780
 well directed dialogues and 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.160
 videos to happen in 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.160
 certain points of the map 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:05.099
 and so that the player has freedom 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.680
 that he was not clamped in the frame is eternal 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.569
 problem in games from a strong storyline i 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.549
 played a few games that tried 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:17.009
 achieve this for example fallout new vegas 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:21.840
 I think there is a very good plot and 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:23.690
 they open world there is not enough rollers but 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.610
 everything was there 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.250
 however it did not seem that anyway 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.020
 something is missing I do not know if it can 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.990
 was associated with the toolkit 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.690
 or more than that but thanks to this game I 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.710
 I realized that this is a very serious task for 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.780
 developers 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.509
 most of our game is already 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.400
 prepared and in my opinion we saved 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:50.940
 tense pace witcher 2 and combined 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.070
 his open world we decided partially 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.250
 change player motivation because 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.039
 Witcher 2 has always been giving you something 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.729
 quest you have a goal you come in 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.729
 right place and doing everything and now on 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.759
 maps we have interesting places 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.409
 which you yourself want to see and we 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:15.630
 really we tried that there was 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:17.310
 interesting and taking job such a place you 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.820
 learn about the history of this place 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.009
 about the events that happened there 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.639
 it is very important to reward the player for 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.740
 he explores the world should not be so 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.599
 to find something interesting you must 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.110
 run back and forth and look for it 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.599
 interesting and that was not like in 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.229
 assassin's creed 3 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:44.070
 I passed the game two weeks ago in 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:47.009
 the main plot and what to do but all 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.409
 side quests are the same and not 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.320
 interesting I could not plunge into 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:55.380
 the world of this mouse is making a game in style 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.159
 cyberpunk yes this game is open world and 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.500
 this is no coincidence truth we hope that 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.330
 everything will be the same as with the first witcher 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.400
 we made a closed game 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.650
 recreated the tools to work with 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.620
 open world we got you and 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.500
 try to improve our games 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:17.460
 toolkit in the future everyone loves games 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.759
 open world think we should go to 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.759
 this direction
