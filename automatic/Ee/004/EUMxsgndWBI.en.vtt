00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you want to find your pendulum there we

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
you want to find your pendulum there we
have<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:43.550> this<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:44.910> regulates<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.600> clock

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
have it this is what regulates the clock

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.270 
have it this is what regulates the clock
here<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.170> real<00:00:46.350> important<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> don't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
here it's real important if you don't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
here it's real important if you don't
have<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.579> pendulum<00:00:47.940> swinging<00:00:48.690> back<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
have your pendulum swinging back and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
have your pendulum swinging back and
forth<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> left<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:51.210> clock

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
forth to the left and right your clock

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.139 
forth to the left and right your clock
will<00:00:51.660> run<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:52.079> too<00:00:52.140> fast<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.850> won't<00:00:54.000> be

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
will run way too fast and it won't be

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.450 
will run way too fast and it won't be
accurate<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.800> regulate<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
accurate and this is how you regulate it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
accurate and this is how you regulate it
also<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:57.059> your<00:00:57.239> clocks<00:00:57.480> running<00:00:57.750> slow<00:00:57.870> you'll

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
also if your clocks running slow you'll

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.430 
also if your clocks running slow you'll
move<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.859> shield<00:00:59.129> down<00:01:00.050> it'll<00:01:01.050> slow<00:01:01.260> your

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
move this shield down it'll slow your

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.509 
move this shield down it'll slow your
clock<00:01:01.680> down<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.660> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.930> move<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.519> it'll

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
clock down and if you move it up it'll

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
clock down and if you move it up it'll
speed<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.110> friction<00:01:07.380> tied

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
speed it up and it's just friction tied

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.420 
speed it up and it's just friction tied
on<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.760> moves<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.420> approximately

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
on here just moves like so approximately

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
on here just moves like so approximately
three<00:01:11.430> eighths<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:11.939> inch<00:01:12.320> movement<00:01:13.320> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
three eighths of an inch movement is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740 
three eighths of an inch movement is
approximately<00:01:14.159> three<00:01:14.460> four<00:01:15.240> minutes<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.600> day

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
approximately three four minutes a day

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.380 
approximately three four minutes a day
that's<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.290> approximate<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.270> your

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that's just approximate so there's your

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.719 
that's just approximate so there's your
pendulum<00:01:21.350> next<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.590> our<00:01:22.619> weights<00:01:22.950> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
pendulum next we have our weights this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.719 
pendulum next we have our weights this
is<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.090> one-day<00:01:24.689> cuckoo<00:01:25.650> only<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.490> two

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is a one-day cuckoo only so we have two

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
is a one-day cuckoo only so we have two
weights<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.360> that's<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.320> powers<00:01:28.619> your

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
weights here that's what powers your

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.899 
weights here that's what powers your
clock<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.740> musical<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.549> you'll<00:01:32.790> have

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
clock you have a musical one you'll have

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.340 
clock you have a musical one you'll have
three<00:01:33.270> weights<00:01:38.270> when<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.420> favorite<00:01:39.960> models

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
three weights when my favorite models

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.990 
three weights when my favorite models
here<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> mill<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.159> Black<00:01:41.369> Forest<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
here the mill in the Black Forest so

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.920 
here the mill in the Black Forest so
you're<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.270> hanging<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> clock

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you're going to be hanging the clock

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.039 
you're going to be hanging the clock
from<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> top<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.149> this<00:01:48.149> hole<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
from the top up here this hole here is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.560 
from the top up here this hole here is
merely<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.710> take<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> back<00:01:50.310> off<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.210> wants

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
merely to take the back off this wants

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.210 
merely to take the back off this wants
to<00:01:51.630> adjust<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.140> Gong<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.770> need<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to adjust your Gong if you need and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
to adjust your Gong if you need and
sometimes<00:01:54.090> they'll<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> little

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
sometimes they'll just have a little

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.770 
sometimes they'll just have a little
slit<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.130> without<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.640> hole<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.180> you'll<00:01:57.600> need

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
slit here without a hole and you'll need

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.590 
slit here without a hole and you'll need
a<00:01:57.810> pencil<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.680> pry<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> back<00:01:59.250> off<00:01:59.490> just<00:02:00.390> like

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
a pencil to pry the back off just like

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.620 
a pencil to pry the back off just like
so<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> gong<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.240> piece<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
so so on the gong we have this piece of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.780 
so so on the gong we have this piece of
paper<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> prevent<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> from

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
paper and that's just to prevent it from

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.949 
paper and that's just to prevent it from
rattling<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.960> take<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.380> off

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.110 

it's<00:02:10.649> important<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.250> Bello<00:02:11.459> clips<00:02:11.849> right

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's important your Bello clips right

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.000 
it's important your Bello clips right
here<00:02:12.359> these<00:02:12.989> two<00:02:13.579> clips<00:02:14.579> on<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.969> bellows<00:02:16.010> will

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
here these two clips on the bellows will

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.309 
here these two clips on the bellows will
sometimes<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.909> red<00:02:18.150> indicator<00:02:18.659> it<00:02:19.079> says

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
sometimes have a red indicator it says

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.890 
sometimes have a red indicator it says
pull<00:02:19.560> out<00:02:19.739> or<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:20.909> of<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> factories<00:02:21.870> just

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
pull out or some of the factories just

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.830 
pull out or some of the factories just
use<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> piece<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.180> metal<00:02:24.180> bent<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.629> there

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
use a piece of metal bent on there

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.990 
use a piece of metal bent on there
without<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.290> red<00:02:25.469> and<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.609> need<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.819> pull

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
without the red and you need to pull

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.849 
without the red and you need to pull
those<00:02:27.120> off

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
those off

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.890 
those off
they<00:02:29.000> hold<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.150> bellows<00:02:30.420> shut<00:02:30.689> for

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
they hold the bellows shut for

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.429 
they hold the bellows shut for
transportation<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.969> prevent<00:02:32.969> the<00:02:36.079> lift<00:02:37.079> that

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
transportation and prevent the lift that

bit turns off your cuckoo and the clock
still<00:03:17.729> keeps<00:03:17.970> going<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.470> turn<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.919> on<00:03:20.069> I'm

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
still keeps going so turn it on I'm

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.580 
still keeps going so turn it on I'm
going<00:03:20.729> to<00:03:20.790> undo<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.449> wire<00:03:21.720> that's<00:03:22.199> holding

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
going to undo this wire that's holding

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.729 
going to undo this wire that's holding
the<00:03:22.650> chains<00:03:22.979> and<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.879> also<00:03:27.319> holds<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.439> chains

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
the chains and it also holds the chains

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.949 
the chains and it also holds the chains
in<00:03:28.949> the<00:03:28.979> bag<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.699> prevents<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.449> chains

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
in the bag but it prevents the chains

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.319 
in the bag but it prevents the chains
from<00:03:31.199> flicking<00:03:31.680> off<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.040> wheel<00:03:32.250> and

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
from flicking off the wheel and

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.780 
from flicking off the wheel and
transportation<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.479> holds<00:03:33.750> them<00:03:33.840> hot<00:03:34.199> and<00:03:34.799> if

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
transportation it holds them hot and if

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.309 
transportation it holds them hot and if
you<00:03:35.909> didn't<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.389> wire<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:37.049> chain

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
you didn't have that wire the chain

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.949 
you didn't have that wire the chain
would<00:03:37.709> probably<00:03:38.459> flip<00:03:38.759> off<00:03:38.939> the<00:03:38.970> wheel<00:03:39.269> inside

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
would probably flip off the wheel inside

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.809 
would probably flip off the wheel inside
and<00:03:40.319> you'd<00:03:40.949> have<00:03:41.099> a<00:03:42.229> clock<00:03:43.229> it<00:03:43.409> wouldn't<00:03:43.680> run

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
and you'd have a clock it wouldn't run

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.460 
and you'd have a clock it wouldn't run
so<00:03:44.819> once<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.209> pull<00:03:45.419> that<00:03:45.449> wire<00:03:45.780> out<00:03:46.079> I'm<00:03:46.319> going

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
so once I pull that wire out I'm going

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.469 
so once I pull that wire out I'm going
to<00:03:46.530> keep<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.829> clock<00:03:47.129> pretty<00:03:47.879> vertical<00:03:48.090> I'm

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
to keep this clock pretty vertical I'm

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.789 
to keep this clock pretty vertical I'm
certainly<00:03:48.840> not<00:03:49.019> going<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.199> turn<00:03:49.379> upside<00:03:49.590> down

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
certainly not going to turn upside down

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.429 
certainly not going to turn upside down
and<00:03:50.489> jiggle<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.479> and<00:03:51.659> stuff<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.259> and

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
and jiggle it and stuff like that and

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.770 
and jiggle it and stuff like that and
we're<00:03:52.560> going<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.709> keep<00:03:52.859> it<00:03:53.040> vertical<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:53.780> your

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
we're going to keep it vertical and your

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.240 
we're going to keep it vertical and your
two<00:03:54.959> hooks<00:03:55.259> here<00:03:55.379> are<00:03:55.739> where<00:03:55.979> the<00:03:56.099> weights

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
two hooks here are where the weights

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.069 
two hooks here are where the weights
hook<00:03:56.549> on<00:03:57.560> no<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.650> could<00:03:59.540> hang<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.569> on<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.840> wall

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
hook on no you could hang it on the wall

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.780 
hook on no you could hang it on the wall
if<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.409> want<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:01.859> just<00:04:01.889> showing<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.400> here

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
if you want I'm just showing you here

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.089 
if you want I'm just showing you here
and<00:04:03.060> then<00:04:03.810> pull<00:04:04.109> out<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.319> wire<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.829> there<00:04:07.979> are

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
and then pull out the wire so there are

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.440 
and then pull out the wire so there are
your<00:04:08.189> two<00:04:08.400> weights

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
your two weights

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.150 
your two weights
a<00:04:11.849> little<00:04:12.849> leader<00:04:13.060> right<00:04:13.390> here<00:04:13.720> this<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.800> where

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
a little leader right here this is where

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.979 
a little leader right here this is where
the<00:04:15.280> pendulum<00:04:15.610> hangs<00:04:15.849> on<00:04:16.090> occasionally<00:04:16.870> it

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
the pendulum hangs on occasionally it

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.080 
the pendulum hangs on occasionally it
might<00:04:17.200> get<00:04:17.410> stuffed<00:04:17.980> up<00:04:18.190> inside<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.880> case

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
might get stuffed up inside the case

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.150 
might get stuffed up inside the case
when<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.079> have<00:04:20.139> your<00:04:20.320> back<00:04:20.470> door<00:04:20.739> off<00:04:20.950> you

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
when you have your back door off you

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.100 
when you have your back door off you
want<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.370> make<00:04:21.519> sure<00:04:21.549> it's<00:04:21.880> through<00:04:22.600> that<00:04:22.810> slot

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
want to make sure it's through that slot

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.750 
want to make sure it's through that slot
right<00:04:23.740> there<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.090> just<00:04:25.360> hooks<00:04:25.570> on<00:04:26.760> I'm

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
right there and that just hooks on I'm
