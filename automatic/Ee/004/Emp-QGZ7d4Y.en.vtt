another<00:02:24.430> pro<00:02:24.790> would<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.599> more

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
another pro would be that you have more

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.539 
another pro would be that you have more
risk<00:02:26.079> wealth<00:02:26.409> because<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:26.950> costs<00:02:27.280> more

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
risk wealth because it costs more

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.300

compared<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.269> for<00:02:28.480> example<00:02:28.950> d'hide<00:02:29.950> if<00:02:30.190> you're

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
compared to for example d'hide if you're

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.250 
compared to for example d'hide if you're
arranging<00:02:30.579> so<00:02:31.360> more<00:02:31.659> rushers<00:02:31.989> will<00:02:32.140> be

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
arranging so more rushers will be

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.750

interested in rushing you now for the
male<00:02:33.909> icons<00:02:34.349> more<00:02:35.349> risks<00:02:35.620> wealth<00:02:35.799> would<00:02:36.099> also

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
male icons more risks wealth would also

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.399 
male icons more risks wealth would also
be<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.579> con<00:02:36.849> because<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.900> die<00:02:38.140> you're

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
be a con because if you die you're

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.319 
be a con because if you die you're

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
melee armor has high defense this means

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.069 
melee armor has high defense this means
that<00:02:42.700> when<00:02:42.909> you<00:02:43.030> get<00:02:43.120> rush<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.629> cloth<00:02:43.810> specs

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
that when you get rush the cloth specs

that when you get rush the cloth specs
will<00:02:44.230> most<00:02:44.409> likely<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.739> be<00:02:44.829> lower<00:02:45.069> than<00:02:45.220> if<00:02:45.730> you

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
will most likely to be lower than if you

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.970 
will most likely to be lower than if you
were<00:02:46.000> wearing<00:02:46.299> d'hide<00:02:46.690> for<00:02:46.900> example<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.829> your

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
were wearing d'hide for example so your

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.039 
were wearing d'hide for example so your
your<00:02:48.609> vengeance<00:02:49.000> will<00:02:49.180> hit<00:02:49.329> back<00:02:49.540> lower<00:02:49.810> as

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
your vengeance will hit back lower as

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.470 
your vengeance will hit back lower as
well<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.889> final<00:02:51.310> con<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.730> using<00:02:52.060> melee<00:02:52.359> when

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
well the final con of using melee when

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.940 
well the final con of using melee when
enter<00:02:52.720> rushing<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.230> most<00:02:53.379> rushers<00:02:53.769> prey

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
enter rushing is that most rushers prey

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.830 
enter rushing is that most rushers prey
melee<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.849> when<00:02:54.970> they<00:02:55.060> rush<00:02:55.299> you<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.659> always

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
melee so when they rush you you always

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.240 
melee so when they rush you you always
get<00:02:56.079> one<00:02:56.230> hit<00:02:56.379> back<00:02:56.590> before<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:56.980> cross<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
get one hit back before you cross the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.860 
get one hit back before you cross the
spec<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.970> probably<00:02:58.209> won't<00:02:58.450> be<00:02:58.629> able<00:02:58.750> to

do any damage through their prayer so

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.160
