that's<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.470> pollinate<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.130> flowers

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
that's it so you pollinate the flowers

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.309 
that's it so you pollinate the flowers
and<00:03:13.730> doors<00:03:13.910> because<00:03:14.270> there<00:03:14.840> are<00:03:14.989> no<00:03:15.110> bees

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
and doors because there are no bees

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.580 
and doors because there are no bees
we've<00:03:16.310> become<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.819> bees<00:03:17.170> take<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.260> easy<00:03:18.440> as

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
we've become the bees take it easy as
