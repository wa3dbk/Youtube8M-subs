test some of the ultra hardcore things

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.359 
test some of the ultra hardcore things
for<00:01:27.990> example<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.680> were<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.920> type<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.869> /

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
for example if I were to type in /

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.679 
for example if I were to type in /
spread<00:01:32.540> players<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:35.520> type<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.479> x

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
spread players you type in your the x

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.330 
spread players you type in your the x
coordinate<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> z<00:01:37.680> coordinate<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.159> where

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
coordinate and the z coordinate of where

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.770 
coordinate and the z coordinate of where
you're<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> should<00:01:39.030> probably<00:01:39.150> look<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you're at so I should probably look that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.920 
you're at so I should probably look that
up<00:01:39.810> before<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:42.799> let's<00:01:43.799> see

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
up before I do this actually let's see

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
up before I do this actually let's see
ex-<00:01:45.930> let<00:01:46.829> me<00:01:46.920> write<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> down<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
ex- let me write this down actually I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.039 
ex- let me write this down actually I
can<00:01:48.689> get<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.369> 598<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> better<00:01:51.720> pen

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.490 
negative 598 and 33
then<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.610> type<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.390> minimum<00:02:14.810> distance<00:02:15.020> you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
then you type the minimum distance you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.470 
then you type the minimum distance you
want<00:02:15.680> players<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.100> be<00:02:16.460> away<00:02:16.970> from<00:02:17.030> each<00:02:17.270> other

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
want players to be away from each other

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.980 
want players to be away from each other
so<00:02:18.940> because<00:02:19.940> i<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.150> no<00:02:20.330> players<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.780> doesn't

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
so because i have no players it doesn't

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.090 
so because i have no players it doesn't
really<00:02:21.080> matter<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.500> whole<00:02:21.560> lot<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.010> i'm<00:02:22.070> just

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
really matter a whole lot so i'm just

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.600 
really matter a whole lot so i'm just
going<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.340> pretend<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.160> type<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
going to pretend and then you type the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.550 
going to pretend and then you type the
radius<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.240> how<00:02:26.420> far<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.110> them<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.440> be

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
radius of how far you want them to be

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.280 
radius of how far you want them to be
spread<00:02:27.890> out<00:02:27.920> from<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.600> central<00:02:29.990> point

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
spread out from the this central point

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.170 
spread out from the this central point
again<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.370> don't<00:02:31.640> really<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.000> lot<00:02:32.120> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
again I don't really have a lot of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.910 
again I don't really have a lot of
players<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.560> like<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.890> can

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
players here so it's not like you can

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.450 
players here so it's not like you can
really<00:02:34.190> have<00:02:34.730> an<00:02:34.850> accurate<00:02:35.090> test<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:36.460> i'm

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
really have an accurate test of this i'm

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.140 
really have an accurate test of this i'm
just<00:02:37.580> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.940> ten<00:02:38.090> again<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:41.000> you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
just going to do ten again and then you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.030 
just going to do ten again and then you
type<00:02:41.390> either<00:02:41.600> true<00:02:41.960> or<00:02:41.990> false<00:02:42.380> depending<00:02:42.590> on

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
type either true or false depending on

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250 
type either true or false depending on
if<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.340> want<00:02:43.370> teams<00:02:43.910> if<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.750> type<00:02:44.930> false

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
if you want teams if you type false

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.380 
if you want teams if you type false
it'll<00:02:45.620> be<00:02:45.710> no<00:02:45.890> teams<00:02:46.190> if<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.640> type<00:02:46.850> true<00:02:47.150> it'll

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
it'll be no teams if you type true it'll

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.960 
it'll be no teams if you type true it'll
be<00:02:47.540> teams<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:49.100> way<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.280> do<00:02:49.460> teams<00:02:49.760> is

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
be teams and the way you do teams is

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.850 
be teams and the way you do teams is
with<00:02:50.180> command<00:02:51.050> blocks<00:02:51.320> actually<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.770> don't

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
with command blocks actually I don't

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.740 
with command blocks actually I don't
really<00:02:52.220> know<00:02:52.580> how<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.090> team<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:53.540> I'm<00:02:53.660> just

how to do it easily and you can get it
on<00:04:03.650> your<00:04:03.770> first<00:04:03.920> try<00:04:04.100> on<00:04:04.370> like<00:04:04.520> what<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.790> did

that was weird okay and last but not
least<00:04:08.420> let's<00:04:08.900> put<00:04:09.170> this<00:04:09.260> into<00:04:09.440> UHC<00:04:09.950> mode<00:04:10.160> I'm

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
least let's put this into UHC mode I'm

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.740 
least let's put this into UHC mode I'm
actually<00:04:10.490> going<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.820> change<00:04:11.030> my<00:04:11.090> game<00:04:11.210> mode<00:04:11.570> to

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
actually going to change my game mode to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.020 
actually going to change my game mode to
survival<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:13.810> then<00:04:14.810> I'm<00:04:15.200> going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.680> turn<00:04:16.430> UHC

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
survival and then I'm going to turn UHC

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.390 
survival and then I'm going to turn UHC

should give you the near full then you

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.600 
should give you the near full then you
know<00:05:22.980> so<00:05:23.910> that's<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.240> only<00:05:24.360> way<00:05:24.720> to

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
know so that's the only way to

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.520 
know so that's the only way to
regenerate<00:05:26.610> health<00:05:26.730> with<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.600> UHC<00:05:27.960> mode<00:05:28.350> on
