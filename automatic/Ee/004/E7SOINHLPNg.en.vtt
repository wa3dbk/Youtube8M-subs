00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 I have the feeling we are 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.350
 again more 1997 why because two big ones 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.350
 filmmaker done two big things 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.960
 Last night is the internet 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.800
 explodes because the message came out 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.580
 that george lucas sold lucasfilm 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 for 4 5 billion the media goes mogul 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.890
 to Disney and has just his 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.620
 success story star wars at walt disney 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.969
 pictures sells what's for the series 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.250
 means is clear 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 although george lucas said he does 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.190
 no star wars movies anymore because he always 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.219
 said so for story saying now 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 walt disney star wars episode 7 is coming 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:57.390
 In 2015, lucas said it must 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.539
 universe such a wealth of stories 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.930
 we now have the opel public 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.549
 and so on and so forth initiates or 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.340
 There are so many possibilities you can 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.760
 but he can fight for it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.460
 episodes 7 8 and 9 already a loses 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.500
 script prefabricated fans all over the world 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.869
 Of course, they are now on one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 double-edged sword the way 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.509
 Saying it can not get any worse 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.640
 Be the super the nabu the others 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.680
 say that if now the commercial peace 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.400
 Disney is behind the name star wars 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.560
 a big part of the heart of 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.720
 star wars breaks and it is now 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.270
 is sung right out until we 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.840
 everywhere just star clear delete there 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.479
 is and so in series of star wars the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.490
 not necessarily on lukas mist 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.930
 have grown and so on and so forth 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.610
 I would like your opinion 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.259
 What are you thinking about that? 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.689
 future of star wars we need 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.630
 really episode 7 since we are already on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.920
 episode 1 to 3 was a little disappointed 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.509
 not just a little bit why did george 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.549
 lucas not just the company in 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.799
 strong kennedy passed without her 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.840
 He wanted to sell to Disney Disney 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:16.120
 really $ 45 billion 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.410
 more or just what I mean 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.120
 that does not make a big difference 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.319
 Be one of the richest in the world 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.870
 second message to me yesterday 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.180
 was reached that roland emmerich 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.849
 with a new film of the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.049
 something with action and shootings too 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.950
 and we have to do the president 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.049
 Protect there is a new news 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.030
 and that gives typical longer and 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.459
 two said we make independence 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.890
 Day 2 and 3 are the movies 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.810
 independence day for the arab world tour 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.400
 and now he always tries one like that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.430
 to feel a bit touched with 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.170
 the fans in the world because on the fourth 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.849
 july 2013 comes independence day 3d ins 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.769
 movie theater 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.090
 Yeah, not only starts writing 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.129
 we have star wars this year 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.530
 3d episode 2 and the beautiful and the 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.299
 beast 3d together with the previous ones 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.620
 nemo 33 finds the titanic 3d 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.790
 now also roland emmerich jumps up 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.299
 the train and for three goes its biggest 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.190
 Success Independence Day was a good one 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.880
 Film was by the critics but at that time 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.829
 a bit dominated because he pretty much 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.540
 stereotype was moderate and not so 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.639
 really well matured in the story 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.480
 but it is a damned 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.900
 catastrophe film and since when had 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.389
 the good stories what do you think about that 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.609
 independence day for ever 2 and so 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.700
 independence day for ever and in the 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.590
 panels 3d let them know me writes 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.660
 it purely as always much fun in the cinema 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.910
 even before the domestic glare I am 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.720
 trick session peter feldmann like 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.180
 seen by me 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.139
 most of the time I'm supposed to make room in the city 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.099
 I grew up 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.099
 in the hidden place 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 there
