00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.790
 yes you have 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.269
 the rest of the national nature workday ahead 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.479
 so then you have to train 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.649
 student train by smart 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.949
 bring the genius card with a few days 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.929
 but I can hold the ball now with the government's earlier video conference 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.589
 have done 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.169
 the young attacker did have deloitte versus sport week 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.289
 a couple that is also part of where the state secretary came to see 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.500
 very important because program to watch the spam when are you watching how 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 easier to see a distance 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.690
 and other good ones died 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 what would you do as a society 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.649
 is the metal and the Netherlands with the Dutch champion 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.750
 as soon as you look at the spot the start counting with the tracing a 2 3 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.930
 9 2 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.760
 the chance that you will figure it out 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560
 unfortunately it is a cigarette and it comes with jumping 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.250
 so I want to go there but you learn to see what an exercise can do before 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.950
 to learn to see a distance better 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.359
 s van laar is very important if you jump next 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.980
 with that very nice forward pace and it leads 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.250
 you have to have an option to do something from that number 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.140
 I see frame sold and tasty because of fitting 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.310
 also it is very important if your distance is not sick you do not have rich 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.100
 then you better keep participating and relax your hands pull your horse 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.630
 to trace the hard rock 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.530
 because when I pull I can no longer even it is important that load and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.270
 pay his pallai petty salary along with those as projects easily to the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 learn to see distance 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.520
 at the same time do a lot with the ball to also train you for the jump 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.759
 working with Merkel Anneke ahead 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.840
 I would show you now 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.220
 I can claire your three balls for this suggests the new leader 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.060
 yes and i he honestly there seems to be a job far away lead by those three balls 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.690
 look 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.690
 get the purple and short drive menneke 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.769
 the horsemen's least on the first balls comes through those three balls 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.760
 walk is going well anyway and I could still get chances at the school this band a bag 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.150
 on 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
 more than three meters apart 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.979
 and a little 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.039
 disgust very important 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.039
 to save on track rights 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.799
 who looks here after the first bale I there is nothing there after the jump what if 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.459
 the first ball I have is going to look at the railway trees h 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.119
 have mastered within these three malikis 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.299
 where the first bales get 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.669
 explain the following 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.669
 try too wide 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.249
 talk to each other fine if you have mastered this well you can do benches 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.249
 employees 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:17.409
 also important here is just I want to relax counts 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 It is the perfect size you can even with once I think about you 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.260
 leg 2 3 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.489
 X 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.579
 This is the case that many reach the agreement 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.900
 can only show you something 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.069
 but then what the next step is and that is just running one 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.510
 line with two units 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.840
 I do not have a single line to see they distance, we will be disappointed 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.539
 to tell 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.619
 and I try to show myself everywhere he would be a nice one anyway 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.619
 turning distance 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.969
 lost 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.409
 Laurent got a big distance on the say too 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.059
 but because they got stuck for a long time, a few could have been too easy 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.150
 and a whole team of nice nice surprise you come to the opponent May 5 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.370
 standing for laeremans team of year so there is important bees 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.919
 makes many jumps 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.299
 after making a lot of spam and he had learned to see better 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:19.649
 it is important here bees of the hundred men you make almost 

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.509
 a hundred times the same comes from bahrami who are talking about things with the ball and 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.309
 exercises with a line 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:29.179
 also the cda list very important almere to create a different sense of rhythm 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
 you just have to make a lot of meters and then it rarely happens 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.800
 3 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.530
 have
