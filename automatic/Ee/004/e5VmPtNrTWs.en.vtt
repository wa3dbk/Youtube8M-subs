00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello youtube friends in this video 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.990
 tutorial try to explain how to do 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.290
 a traditional paper toy 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.170
 I will not try to explain how to have 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.310
 this thing that is according to you have searched in 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.560
 internet I'm not very well your name 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.890
 They say it's a traditional toy 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.800
 paper 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.119
 is typical of doing something like that and the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.949
 truth is that it is a pretty figure 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.949
 easy easy to follow your mother 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.739
 we start from a square of one per 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.120
 one with all sides equal already 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.620
 you know how to do it if you look at us 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.239
 other videos that are on my channel and good 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.250
 I always recommend using paper 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.920
 recycled but for these things like 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.570
 let's draw and do stupid things because 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.629
 it is better to have a white sheet and you are 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.360
 To my regret, well, first we'll mark 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.520
 a line that crosses the paper from one side 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.160
 aside doing this 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.160
 and staying on the edge so that it is 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.730
 very accurate then we will do the same for 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.730
 the other side 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.930
 I had done it before but good 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.270
 the paper here in the center that's where 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.860
 intersect the lines we see here the point 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.869
 and this point then we have to go from 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.620
 this point to the center making 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.680
 these lines match 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.810
 in this way we will be very accurate and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.890
 we repeat the process with the four 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.570
 sides 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.490
 always where you want exact if not 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.490
 we will have a figure of Ford 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.280
 very good when we have done it for 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.640
 the four sides we turn around 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.930
 paper you pay attention here are seen as a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.170
 lines that make a square 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.630
 there are four squares good so what 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.810
 you have to do is this point until the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.640
 center following the lines like this 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.640
 and do the same with all four sides 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.869
 and once we have this without anything else 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.869
 we simply fold in half 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.770
 that stays well we comment the little fingers 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.210
 in the openings 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.210
 let's go a little yes 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.520
 the guy this we already have our 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.920
 paper figure the alborÃ¡ or to make 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.920
 so what has touched you this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.490
 preschool classes 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.580
 we can play or do my son 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.020
 join me together we will conquer the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.570
 galaxy has no face 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.850
 or things like that you already know if you liked it 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.900
