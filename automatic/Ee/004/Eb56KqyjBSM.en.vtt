section is slightly sloping from here
going<00:01:00.170> down<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:00.559> way<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:00.950> it's<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:01.340> little

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
going down that way and it's a little

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.459 
going down that way and it's a little
bit<00:01:01.640> wibbly-wobbly<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:02.390> between<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.260> what<00:01:03.440> I

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
bit wibbly-wobbly in between so what I

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.770 
bit wibbly-wobbly in between so what I
want<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.739> do<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.100> put<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> string<00:01:05.149> line<00:01:05.329> on<00:01:05.509> from

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
want to do is put a string line on from

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.539 
want to do is put a string line on from
point<00:01:05.990> A<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.200> B<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.710> I'm<00:01:07.070> going<00:01:07.189> to<00:01:07.219> measure<00:01:07.399> a

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
point A to B and I'm going to measure a

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.969 
point A to B and I'm going to measure a
hundred<00:01:07.909> mil<00:01:08.120> off<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.750> ground<00:01:09.020> okay<00:01:09.620> so<00:01:09.680> let's

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
hundred mil off the ground okay so let's

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.789 
hundred mil off the ground okay so let's
just<00:01:10.120> adjust<00:01:11.120> that<00:01:11.570> string<00:01:11.900> line<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.590> we're<00:01:12.770> a

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
just adjust that string line so we're a

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.440 
just adjust that string line so we're a
hundred<00:01:13.010> mil<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.700> we'll<00:01:13.790> come<00:01:14.000> back<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.330> our

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
hundred mil and we'll come back to our

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.280 
hundred mil and we'll come back to our
other<00:01:14.600> end

sort<00:01:46.759> of<00:01:46.790> situation<00:01:50.710> let's<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.920> check<00:01:52.100> out

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
sort of situation let's just check out

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.370 
sort of situation let's just check out
our<00:01:52.310> hole<00:01:52.640> we<00:01:52.850> need<00:01:52.880> 110<00:01:53.630> mil<00:01:53.840> deep<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.320> our

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
our hole we need 110 mil deep for our

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.260 
our hole we need 110 mil deep for our
trench<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.979> we've<00:01:55.700> got<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> hundred<00:01:56.060> mil

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
trench and we've got a hundred mil

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.510 
trench and we've got a hundred mil
sticking<00:01:56.630> off<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.900> our<00:01:57.020> datum<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:57.770> 210

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
sticking off to our datum so that's 210

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.210 
sticking off to our datum so that's 210
mil<00:01:58.790> all<00:01:58.939> up<00:01:59.119> we're<00:01:59.270> looking<00:01:59.330> for<00:02:00.009> now<00:02:01.009> that's

mil all up we're looking for now that's

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.980 
mil all up we're looking for now that's
looking<00:02:01.400> pretty<00:02:01.579> good<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.240> I'll<00:02:02.720> just<00:02:02.840> go

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
looking pretty good so I'll just go

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.640 
looking pretty good so I'll just go
along<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.229> finish<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.710> off<00:02:05.380> okay<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.470> next

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
along and finish that off okay the next

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.109 
along and finish that off okay the next
thing<00:02:06.710> we're<00:02:06.890> going<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.070> do<00:02:07.189> is<00:02:07.340> put<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.610> our<00:02:07.729> 20

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
thing we're going to do is put on our 20

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.969 
thing we're going to do is put on our 20
mil<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.269> base<00:02:08.479> course<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.739> I'm<00:02:09.860> just

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
mil of base course to do that I'm just

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.920 
mil of base course to do that I'm just
using<00:02:10.280> some<00:02:10.399> scoria

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
using some scoria

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.920 
using some scoria
and<00:02:12.379> we'll<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.680> tip<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.010> on

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.750 

and<00:02:16.930> let's<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.710> give<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.980> stomp<00:02:18.310> down<00:02:18.520> so

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
and let's just give it a stomp down so

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.590 
and let's just give it a stomp down so
it's<00:02:18.880> nice<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.320> solid<00:02:20.320> using<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.190> sledgehammer

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.880 

I'm<00:02:25.600> going<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> finish<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.260> off<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.710> then

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
I'm going to finish that off and then

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:41.430 
I'm going to finish that off and then
we're<00:02:27.190> ready<00:02:27.370> for<00:02:27.460> concrete<00:02:39.510> we're<00:02:40.510> after<00:02:40.570> 140

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
we're ready for concrete we're after 140

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.960 
we're ready for concrete we're after 140
ml<00:02:41.650> from<00:02:41.890> our<00:02:42.040> line<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.580> top<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.880> our

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
ml from our line to the top of our

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.740 
ml from our line to the top of our
concrete<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> we're<00:02:46.030> not<00:02:46.120> looking<00:02:46.270> too<00:02:46.570> bad

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
concrete so we're not looking too bad

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.370 
concrete so we're not looking too bad
there<00:02:46.990> now

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
there now

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.780 
there now
now<00:02:47.709> I've<00:02:47.830> just<00:02:47.980> made<00:02:48.160> up<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.430> little<00:02:48.640> wooden

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
now I've just made up a little wooden

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.400 
now I've just made up a little wooden
float<00:02:49.150> out<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.510> an<00:02:49.600> old<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> four<00:02:50.080> bit<00:02:50.230> too

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
float out of an old but a four bit too

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.080 
float out of an old but a four bit too
so<00:02:50.920> I'm<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.130> going<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.370> use<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:51.700> just<00:02:51.910> to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
so I'm just going to use that just to

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.890 
so I'm just going to use that just to
smooth<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.630> out<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.870> little<00:02:53.050> bit<00:02:57.690> okay<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:58.720> I'm

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
smooth this out a little bit okay so I'm

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.270 
smooth this out a little bit okay so I'm
just<00:02:59.080> going<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.290> smooth<00:02:59.620> off<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.010> rest<00:03:00.160> of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
just going to smooth off the rest of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.070 
just going to smooth off the rest of
this<00:03:00.370> concrete<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.030> then<00:03:01.480> we're<00:03:01.720> ready<00:03:01.840> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
this concrete and then we're ready to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.110 
this concrete and then we're ready to
install<00:03:02.230> our<00:03:02.680> concrete<00:03:03.040> edging<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.670> you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
install our concrete edging so you

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.090 
install our concrete edging so you
actually<00:03:07.209> want<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.570> work<00:03:07.800> relatively<00:03:08.800> quickly

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
actually want to work relatively quickly

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.340 
actually want to work relatively quickly
here<00:03:09.520> you<00:03:10.209> know<00:03:10.330> on<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.510> day<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:11.080> it's

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.560 
here you know on a day like this it's
quite<00:03:11.500> overcast<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:13.030> concrete<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.450> not

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
quite overcast and the concrete is not

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.770 
quite overcast and the concrete is not
going<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.780> go<00:03:13.900> off<00:03:13.959> too<00:03:14.170> quick<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.280> still

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
going to go off too quick but still

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.570 
going to go off too quick but still
you've<00:03:16.780> got<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.020> be<00:03:17.110> relatively<00:03:17.680> quick<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.490> I'm

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
you've got to be relatively quick so I'm

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.130 
you've got to be relatively quick so I'm
just<00:03:18.760> betting<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.510> concrete<00:03:19.870> about

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
just betting that in the concrete about

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.000 
just betting that in the concrete about
10<00:03:20.380> mil<00:03:20.560> down

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
10 mil down

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.040 
10 mil down
it's<00:03:21.640> just<00:03:21.850> double<00:03:22.150> check<00:03:22.420> off<00:03:22.600> our<00:03:22.810> line

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
it's just double check off our line

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.440 
it's just double check off our line
we're<00:03:23.620> after<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.920> hundred<00:03:24.190> mil<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:25.269> that's

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
we're after a hundred mil so that's

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.509 
we're after a hundred mil so that's
looking<00:03:25.630> pretty<00:03:25.810> good<00:03:26.080> so<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:27.100> whole<00:03:27.250> time

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
looking pretty good so the whole time

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.340 
looking pretty good so the whole time
I'm<00:03:27.730> just<00:03:27.760> keeping<00:03:28.390> an<00:03:28.480> eye<00:03:28.630> exactly<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:29.320> that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
I'm just keeping an eye exactly on that

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.830 
I'm just keeping an eye exactly on that
string<00:03:29.800> line<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.640> keep<00:03:30.820> my<00:03:31.030> pavers<00:03:31.450> and

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
string line just to keep my pavers and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.240 
string line just to keep my pavers and
line<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:35.350> measuring<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.950> front

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
line that and just measuring the front

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.580 
line that and just measuring the front
and<00:03:36.400> back<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.580> every<00:03:37.000> paver<00:03:37.300> just<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.320> insure

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
and back of every paver just to insure

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.910 
and back of every paver just to insure
that<00:03:38.620> we're<00:03:39.010> right<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.400> track<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.320> idea<00:03:41.709> is

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
that we're right on track so the idea is

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.160 
that we're right on track so the idea is
not<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.910> put<00:03:43.030> too<00:03:43.239> much<00:03:43.420> concrete<00:03:43.720> on<00:03:44.019> your

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
not to put too much concrete on your

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.350 
not to put too much concrete on your
trench<00:03:44.440> we<00:03:45.160> don't<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.519> concrete<00:03:45.910> coming<00:03:46.150> all

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
trench we don't the concrete coming all

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.580 
trench we don't the concrete coming all
the<00:03:46.480> way<00:03:46.510> up<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.989> top<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.350> paver

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
the way up to the top of the paver

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.100 
the way up to the top of the paver
because<00:03:48.489> we<00:03:48.640> want<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.940> push<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.299> grass<00:03:49.510> up<00:03:49.810> to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
because we want to push the grass up to

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.170 
because we want to push the grass up to

paper to finish in line with our Mackay

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.520 
paper to finish in line with our Mackay
sleepers<00:04:12.970> here<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.870> I'm<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:14.140> going<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.319> run<00:04:14.500> a

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
sleepers here so I'm just going to run a

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.629 
sleepers here so I'm just going to run a
line<00:04:14.769> down<00:04:15.570> off<00:04:16.570> our<00:04:16.840> sleepers<00:04:17.400> we<00:04:18.400> put<00:04:18.609> a

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
line down off our sleepers we put a

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.400 
line down off our sleepers we put a
pencil<00:04:18.910> mark<00:04:19.269> on<00:04:19.750> our<00:04:19.810> paper

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
pencil mark on our paper

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.870 
pencil mark on our paper
so<00:04:20.829> now<00:04:20.979> I'm<00:04:21.039> going<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.220> take<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.579> way<00:04:21.729> and

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
so now I'm going to take that way and

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.810 
so now I'm going to take that way and
cut<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.229> I'm<00:04:23.229> using<00:04:23.500> an<00:04:23.650> angle<00:04:23.979> grinder<00:04:24.009> with<00:04:24.580> a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
cut it I'm using an angle grinder with a

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.820 
cut it I'm using an angle grinder with a
diamond<00:04:25.120> blade<00:04:25.360> on<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.139> you<00:04:26.229> can<00:04:26.259> also<00:04:26.500> use

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
diamond blade on it but you can also use

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:36.000 
diamond blade on it but you can also use
a<00:04:26.860> masonry<00:04:27.400> blade

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.310 

it's<00:04:36.490> just<00:04:36.700> double-check<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.480> was<00:04:38.020> sitting

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
it's just double-check that was sitting

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.610 
it's just double-check that was sitting
on<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.410> hundy<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.880> make<00:04:40.780> sure<00:04:40.960> nice<00:04:41.380> and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
on a hundy and make sure nice and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.810 
on a hundy and make sure nice and
straight<00:04:41.830> on<00:04:41.950> a<00:04:41.980> line<00:04:42.220> that's<00:04:42.370> looking<00:04:42.700> good

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
straight on a line that's looking good

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.700 
straight on a line that's looking good
okay<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:43.450> we<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:43.750> got<00:04:43.900> our<00:04:44.020> last<00:04:44.230> piece<00:04:44.530> to

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
okay so we just got our last piece to

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.100 
okay so we just got our last piece to
cut<00:04:44.920> I'm<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.670> to<00:04:45.760> measure<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.030> up<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.840> cut

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
cut I'm going to measure that up and cut

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.200 
cut I'm going to measure that up and cut
it<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.320> same<00:04:47.350> as<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:47.860> one

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
it the same as this one

00:04:48.210 --> 00:05:04.230 
it the same as this one
375<00:05:01.890> cool<00:05:02.890> everything's<00:05:03.340> looking<00:05:03.490> fantastic

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.760 
375 cool everything's looking fantastic
I'm<00:05:04.330> just<00:05:04.540> going<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:04.720> do<00:05:04.840> one<00:05:05.050> more<00:05:05.080> check<00:05:05.530> just

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
I'm just going to do one more check just

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.280 
I'm just going to do one more check just
to<00:05:06.220> make<00:05:06.370> sure<00:05:06.400> nothing's<00:05:07.240> being<00:05:07.480> knocked<00:05:07.750> we

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
to make sure nothing's being knocked we

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.860 
to make sure nothing's being knocked we
want<00:05:08.500> these<00:05:08.650> all<00:05:08.890> nice<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.340> straight<00:05:09.640> and

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
want these all nice and straight and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.080 
want these all nice and straight and
also<00:05:10.870> exactly<00:05:11.620> 100<00:05:11.920> mile<00:05:12.040> off<00:05:12.130> our<00:05:12.280> line<00:05:12.520> so

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
also exactly 100 mile off our line so

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.120 
also exactly 100 mile off our line so
now<00:05:13.300> this<00:05:13.810> is<00:05:13.960> only<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.200> small<00:05:14.380> stretch<00:05:14.890> this<00:05:15.070> is

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
now this is only a small stretch this is

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.680 
now this is only a small stretch this is
only<00:05:15.310> about<00:05:15.640> three<00:05:15.910> or<00:05:16.000> four<00:05:16.150> meters<00:05:16.330> long<00:05:16.660> so

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
only about three or four meters long so

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.540 
only about three or four meters long so
if<00:05:17.290> you're<00:05:17.470> doing<00:05:17.560> any<00:05:17.800> longer<00:05:18.220> than<00:05:18.370> this<00:05:18.490> and

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
if you're doing any longer than this and

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.100 
if you're doing any longer than this and
it's<00:05:18.820> a<00:05:18.880> really<00:05:19.060> really<00:05:19.180> hot<00:05:19.510> day<00:05:19.690> I'll

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
it's a really really hot day I'll

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.200 
it's a really really hot day I'll
suggest<00:05:20.350> maybe<00:05:20.740> only<00:05:21.130> doing<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.460> maybe<00:05:21.970> about

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
suggest maybe only doing a maybe about

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.300 
suggest maybe only doing a maybe about
four<00:05:22.420> or<00:05:22.510> five<00:05:22.660> pavers<00:05:23.110> at<00:05:23.230> a<00:05:23.260> time<00:05:23.560> especially

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
four or five pavers at a time especially

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.740 
four or five pavers at a time especially
if<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.580> is<00:05:24.670> a<00:05:24.700> hot<00:05:24.940> day<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.210> don't<00:05:25.480> want<00:05:25.570> that

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
if it is a hot day you don't want that

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.660 
if it is a hot day you don't want that
concrete<00:05:26.110> going<00:05:26.470> off<00:05:26.620> once<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.280> concrete

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
concrete going off once the concrete

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.460 
concrete going off once the concrete
sets<00:05:27.940> we'll<00:05:28.630> be<00:05:28.780> ready<00:05:28.960> for<00:05:29.200> our<00:05:29.260> next<00:05:29.470> step

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
sets we'll be ready for our next step

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.870 
sets we'll be ready for our next step
okay<00:05:32.470> I've<00:05:32.590> just<00:05:32.620> mixed<00:05:33.040> up<00:05:33.160> some<00:05:33.340> mortar<00:05:33.700> and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
okay I've just mixed up some mortar and

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.670 
okay I've just mixed up some mortar and
I'm<00:05:34.300> just<00:05:34.510> wedging<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:35.320> there<00:05:35.470> quite

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
I'm just wedging it in there quite

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.310 
I'm just wedging it in there quite
nicely<00:05:35.950> with<00:05:36.220> this<00:05:36.310> little<00:05:36.580> pointing<00:05:37.000> trail

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
nicely with this little pointing trail

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.750 
nicely with this little pointing trail
the<00:05:38.320> idea<00:05:38.620> when<00:05:38.770> mixing<00:05:39.040> this<00:05:39.160> up<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.490> want<00:05:39.670> it

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
the idea when mixing this up you want it

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.670 
the idea when mixing this up you want it
relatively<00:05:40.690> runny<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.230> get<00:05:41.350> it<00:05:41.470> in<00:05:41.560> between

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
relatively runny to get it in between

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.420 
relatively runny to get it in between
and<00:05:42.130> just<00:05:43.060> squeeze<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.540> off<00:05:44.070> take<00:05:45.070> off<00:05:45.220> the

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
and just squeeze it off take off the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.090 
and just squeeze it off take off the
excess<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:48.610> I've<00:05:49.210> let<00:05:49.420> this<00:05:49.540> dry<00:05:49.840> for<00:05:49.870> about<00:05:50.740> 10

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
excess so I've let this dry for about 10

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.400 
excess so I've let this dry for about 10
minutes<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.610> we're<00:05:52.240> just<00:05:52.390> taking<00:05:52.990> off<00:05:53.260> the

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
minutes and we're just taking off the

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.470 
minutes and we're just taking off the
excess<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.980> want<00:05:54.550> to<00:05:54.610> take<00:05:54.790> off<00:05:54.970> too<00:05:55.180> much<00:05:55.210> of

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
excess I want to take off too much of

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.420 
excess I want to take off too much of
the<00:05:55.540> mortar<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:55.900> there<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.260> that's<00:05:56.860> the

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
the mortar in there and that's the

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.520 
the mortar in there and that's the
desire<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:57.850> fit<00:05:58.150> them<00:05:58.330> after<00:05:58.660> yeah<00:05:59.140> just<00:05:59.380> give

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530
