00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.930
 Pharmacy hides human health 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.930
 And it is science that considers human health security 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.580
 For example, if you consider with chemicals 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.330
 Elucidate or explore the mechanism of disease 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.900
 The so-called danyaku research to find out the seed of the role 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:35.239
 And take advantage of this data to be new 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:42.590
 For example, drug research and development that brings out rice technology and reviews new medicines 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:46.320
 From finished though drugs properly and safely use education drug research for the is old will be a representative 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 Eating as there are also things called medicinal food same source 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.890
 To prevent illness by 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.120
 Become one of the research areas 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.050
 In addition this is also and a large theme of the amount to be richly number safely peace of mind to support this the life of the people 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.440
 Because there is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.720
 For example , cosmetic products other than executives 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.870
 For example, food 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:18.710
 Even more is that said this also but will pay off viruses and bacteria in the pathogen Kokoneko 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.710
 Protecting human health from this is also a big research theme 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.409
 Research is a journey through an unanswered world, searching for exactly in the dark 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.710
 This will be research 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:38.740
 Therefore, I am together with the students and it's all about falling in love and enjoying it. 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.909
 Try and get results in it 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:48.189
 There is a time when students make a leap in such an effort 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.400
 Just as this sometimes really educators or researchers but is when such Hitokawamukeru 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.150
 Feel the great pleasure of 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.940
 3 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.750
 That I myself was also a student when I was a new research, and it was a study as it would be in a textbook 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.120
 But 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.120
 Just running down the hallway I remember that ran the original at the time of his mentor 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:20.030
 na If you graduate from the department of performance or the department or creative sciences, so-called drug discovery research in so-called industry-government-academic 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:23.090
 Will fly to the world as a 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:29.630
 8 departments of sixth graders 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:32.660
 Or, for students who graduated from the above-mentioned good pharmacy major, it is a leading medical doctor 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:37.580
 Clinical research as a pharmacist 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.970
 Or together with working in a place that was said research of ToraNarusha this 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.890
 Not just as a conventional pharmacist 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.750
 For example, Te big, skirting also in the administrative field, which said that regulatory or regulatory science 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:54.620
 It is expected that 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:58.180
 Not only in the area of ​​drug discovery but in all areas related to human health 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.640
 Active as a leader is expected 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.569
 I really want you to be a global human resource responsible for securing human health 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.480
 I am 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:16.180
 For this reason, the eight faculties have introduced a study abroad system to make them fly around the world. 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:22.599
 There are also quite a few junior high school students from Western Asia 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.739
 Continue to develop human resources that go fluttered in the world Otsujimashite exchanges with different cultures in that saying, 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.739
 I strongly believe that 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.900
 Osaka University originally has a suitable origin 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:41.700
 Mr. Hongo Ogata sensei was launched 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.569
 It is an academic study to study medicine and pharmacy 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.230
 Strong collaboration with different fields such as medical advantages 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:53.010
 Strong collaboration with clinics including the affiliated hospitals 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:04:00.209
 In addition to Osaka is located in the town of Doshomachi just medicine 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:03.209
 Therefore today leap forward in cooperation with and we Similar rematch University, for example, diffusion and 9 minutes bell of this industry, academia 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.340
 About development of dds about 7 medicine 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:10.690
 We are doing world top level research at Osaka University Naa 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:17.320
 We have also posted on the website 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:23.460
 Innovative drug and medical device regenerative medicine promotion business of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare which had a public offering in 2012 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:30.900
 Has been adopted to promote the development of nucleic acid medicine for car development 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:34.090
 We aim stomach and nucleic acid drugs and was one of the communicating 4 roles directly to a gene as for example, the original of the original 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.860
 Drugs that crush it 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.880
 I think that the voice that did not heal until now will come to cure the incurable disease when there is an original 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.390
 It is in such an approach 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.960
 For example, very detailed in regulatory science 202 strategy 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.960
 We are promoting initiatives to develop leading human resources 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.380
 me 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:05.920
 It is a researcher of the lecture of the world's top level in the Osaka University 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:07.390
 Actively introduced, it is in an environment where you can receive the world's most advanced lectures 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.569
 Wear it on 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:14.030
 We looked at the world by dispatching students overseas from a global perspective 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.980
 I am advancing a lecture 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:23.900
 So-called answers 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:26.500
 We are actively working on lectures that solve problems rather than cats . 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.120
 Are you a student 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:38.070
 Make a dream come true For example, I want to ensure the health of people who want to make medicine 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.070
 We believe that we think that it is enough environmental equipment to answer that 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:50.000
 It is also the language of my teacher 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:53.910
 That it is fierce to make an effort to be first- class but first- class from doing work 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.280
 I want you to do my best in everything 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.060
 Again 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.490
 It is English but it is not finger finger eye can 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:08.800
 With my strong will that I can not do what I wish I could do 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.800
 I want you to work hard towards
