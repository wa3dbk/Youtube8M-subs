00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to be elongated in ovular in shape which

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.850 
to be elongated in ovular in shape which

the<00:03:47.310> concern<00:03:47.489> with<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.909> system<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.419> that

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
the concern with the system is that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.439 
the concern with the system is that

organization persistent as it moves
across<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.989> land<00:03:52.409> will<00:03:52.769> allow<00:03:53.040> much<00:03:53.489> more

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.580 
across the land will allow much more
rain<00:03:53.939> than<00:03:53.970> usual<00:03:54.540> with<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.049> weak<00:03:55.319> tropical
