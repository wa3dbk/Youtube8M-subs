00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
pressing the wrong button here if I

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.289 
pressing the wrong button here if I
don't<00:03:18.280> see<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> power<00:03:18.640> button<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.090> want<00:03:19.239> to

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.649 

yeah<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.250> think<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.700> battery<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.329> might

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
yeah I think the battery on this might

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.390 
yeah I think the battery on this might
be<00:03:30.870> dead<00:03:31.079> so<00:03:31.409> I'm<00:03:31.590> gonna<00:03:31.739> have<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> charge<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
stop the video here and I'll try to

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.580

see if we can get this going here you go

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.140 
see if we can get this going here you go
how<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.590> got<00:03:41.099> it<00:03:41.220> started<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.700> guess<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:41.939> had<00:03:42.060> to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
how you got it started I guess I had to

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.640 
how you got it started I guess I had to
plug<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.810> charge<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.290> little<00:03:43.439> bit

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
plug it in and charge it a little bit

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.030 
plug it in and charge it a little bit
and<00:03:44.359> let's<00:03:45.359> see<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:45.900> we<00:03:46.230> can<00:03:46.439> get<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> start

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
and let's see if we can get it to start

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.500 
and let's see if we can get it to start
up<00:03:47.159> here<00:03:49.370> whoa

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.130 

now<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.140> power<00:03:56.530> button<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:58.000> up<00:03:58.420> here<00:03:58.629> on<00:03:58.750> top<00:03:58.780> I

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
now the power button is up here on top I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.930 
now the power button is up here on top I
guess<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.409> just<00:03:59.440> needed<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.980> be<00:04:00.190> charged<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
guess I just needed to be charged the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.720 
guess I just needed to be charged the
volume<00:04:01.480> rockers<00:04:01.780> are<00:04:02.019> up<00:04:02.110> here<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.580> got

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
volume rockers are up here and I got

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.890 
volume rockers are up here and I got
this<00:04:03.909> in<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> white<00:04:04.330> variant<00:04:04.659> because<00:04:04.840> I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
this in the white variant because I

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.100 
this in the white variant because I
thought<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.230> looked<00:04:05.349> pretty<00:04:05.680> good<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.750> let<00:04:08.019> it

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
thought it looked pretty good and let it

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.130 
thought it looked pretty good and let it
start<00:04:08.379> up<00:04:08.500> here<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.709> guess

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
start up here I guess

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.449 
start up here I guess
to<00:04:11.140> add<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> reset<00:04:11.739> button<00:04:11.769> which<00:04:12.430> is
