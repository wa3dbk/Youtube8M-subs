00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
world and that's going to be very

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.490 
world and that's going to be very
detailed<00:01:00.630> and<00:01:01.630> take<00:01:01.840> up<00:01:01.990> pretty<00:01:02.200> much<00:01:02.350> this

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
detailed and take up pretty much this

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.170 
detailed and take up pretty much this
whole<00:01:02.560> empty<00:01:03.190> space<00:01:03.460> on<00:01:03.610> this<00:01:03.790> side<00:01:03.970> of<00:01:04.000> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
whole empty space on this side of the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.080 
whole empty space on this side of the
stage<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.619> then<00:01:05.860> I'm<00:01:06.159> getting<00:01:06.280> new<00:01:06.520> ideas<00:01:06.880> as

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
stage and then I'm getting new ideas as

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.400 
stage and then I'm getting new ideas as
people<00:01:07.360> are<00:01:07.450> coming<00:01:07.570> up<00:01:07.840> they<00:01:07.960> say<00:01:08.110> hey<00:01:08.230> did

people are coming up they say hey did
you<00:01:08.470> ever<00:01:08.530> think<00:01:08.770> about<00:01:08.860> doing<00:01:09.250> this<00:01:09.370> building

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
you ever think about doing this building

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.300 
you ever think about doing this building
or<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:09.970> building<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.890> when<00:01:12.010> I<00:01:12.040> did<00:01:12.190> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
or this building well when I did the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.430 
or this building well when I did the
Grand<00:01:12.730> Mosque<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.390> Mecca<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:14.080> took<00:01:14.290> over

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
Grand Mosque in Mecca that took over

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.620 
Grand Mosque in Mecca that took over
three<00:01:14.560> months<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.970> Washington<00:01:16.450> Monument

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
three months and the Washington Monument

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.080 
three months and the Washington Monument
took<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.140> day<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:18.100> somewhere<00:01:18.610> between<00:01:18.670> three

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
took a day so somewhere between three

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.600 
took a day so somewhere between three
months<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.600> day<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:20.190> mean<00:01:21.190> some<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.460> these

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
months and a day I mean some of these

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.030 
months and a day I mean some of these
medium-sized<00:01:22.360> temples<00:01:22.990> are<00:01:23.230> about<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.590> month

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
medium-sized temples are about a month

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.950 
medium-sized temples are about a month
month<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.490> half

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
month and a half

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.420 
month and a half
that<00:01:26.530> was<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.710> whole<00:01:26.830> idea<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.250> have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
that was the whole idea is to have

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.899 
that was the whole idea is to have
everything<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:29.170> that<00:01:29.200> same<00:01:29.710> 1/2<00:01:30.130> 1:64<00:01:30.880> scale

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
everything at that same 1/2 1:64 scale

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.450 
everything at that same 1/2 1:64 scale
so<00:01:31.540> if<00:01:31.810> these<00:01:31.990> buildings<00:01:32.440> were<00:01:32.590> actually<00:01:32.979> next

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
so if these buildings were actually next

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.649 
so if these buildings were actually next
to<00:01:33.580> each<00:01:33.700> other<00:01:33.850> this<00:01:34.060> is<00:01:34.119> what<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.450> would<00:01:34.510> look

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
to each other this is what it would look

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.260 
to each other this is what it would look
like<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:38.170> are<00:01:38.409> so<00:01:38.860> much<00:01:39.100> more<00:01:39.729> detailed

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
like these are so much more detailed

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.810 
like these are so much more detailed
than<00:01:40.710> most<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.920> buildings<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.400> toothpick

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
than most of the buildings in toothpick

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.820 
than most of the buildings in toothpick
city<00:01:43.030> one<00:01:43.210> what<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.869> learn<00:01:44.050> by<00:01:44.259> doing<00:01:44.320> you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
city one what you learn by doing you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.859 
city one what you learn by doing you
learn<00:01:45.040> those<00:01:45.220> new<00:01:45.280> techniques<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.180> oh<00:01:46.420> wow<00:01:46.840> I

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
learn those new techniques and oh wow I

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.740 
learn those new techniques and oh wow I
can<00:01:47.259> do<00:01:47.440> spheres<00:01:47.830> like<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.340> can<00:01:48.850> do<00:01:49.119> these

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
can do spheres like I can do these

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.490 
can do spheres like I can do these
ornate<00:01:50.790> work<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.750> find<00:01:53.020> quicker<00:01:53.259> ways

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
ornate work and and I find quicker ways

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
ornate work and and I find quicker ways
to<00:01:53.649> do<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:54.479> I've<00:01:55.479> built<00:01:55.810> over<00:01:56.320> 70<00:01:56.800> buildings

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
to do it I've built over 70 buildings

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.660 
to do it I've built over 70 buildings
from<00:01:58.060> around<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.450> world<00:01:59.220> so<00:02:00.220> I'm<00:02:00.310> running<00:02:00.460> out

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670
