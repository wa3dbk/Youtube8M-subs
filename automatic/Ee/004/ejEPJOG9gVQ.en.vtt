hint<00:00:20.039> before<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.460> heat-treated<00:00:21.179> it<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.539> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
hint before I heat-treated it so it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.919 
hint before I heat-treated it so it
might<00:00:22.589> close<00:00:22.970> but<00:00:23.970> I'll<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.570> able<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
might close but I'll be able to get it

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.040 
might close but I'll be able to get it
back<00:00:25.140> up<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.589> we'll<00:00:25.890> see<00:00:26.660> here's<00:00:27.660> hoping<00:00:27.929> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
back up and we'll see here's hoping the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.990 
back up and we'll see here's hoping the
spring<00:00:28.320> doesn't<00:00:28.529> break

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.200 

far<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:38.210> good<00:00:39.790> she<00:00:40.790> needs<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.090> little

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
far so good she needs a little

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.240 
far so good she needs a little
adjustment<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.960> gotta<00:00:48.260> grind<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.739> kick<00:00:48.950> down

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
adjustment you gotta grind the kick down

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.340 
adjustment you gotta grind the kick down
a<00:00:49.280> little<00:00:49.520> bit<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.120> tip<00:00:50.810> will<00:00:50.960> go<00:00:51.110> down<00:00:51.290> a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
a little bit so the tip will go down a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.880 
a little bit so the tip will go down a
little<00:00:51.440> bit<00:00:51.680> more<00:00:51.950> so<00:00:52.910> i<00:00:53.030> can<00:00:53.120> get<00:00:53.180> it<00:00:53.300> open

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.160 

a<00:00:59.930> little<00:01:00.930> bit<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> adjustment<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:03.050> if<00:01:04.050> I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a little bit of adjustment there if I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.070 
a little bit of adjustment there if I

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
got a lot of fit up the needs to be

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.940 
got a lot of fit up the needs to be
refined<00:02:10.650> it's<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:12.040> pretty<00:02:12.910> rough<00:02:13.709> opening<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
refined it's a pretty rough opening and

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.460 
refined it's a pretty rough opening and
closing<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:18.330> need<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.540> refine<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.140> some

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
closing so I need to refine that some

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.580 
closing so I need to refine that some
too<00:02:23.069> okay<00:02:24.069> here<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.489> in<00:02:24.700> all<00:02:24.790> its<00:02:25.290> glory<00:02:26.290> if

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
too okay here it is in all its glory if

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.350 
too okay here it is in all its glory if
you<00:02:26.739> want<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.980> call<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.489> guess<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.920> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you want to call it that I guess it's a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.150 
you want to call it that I guess it's a
extremely<00:02:31.360> rough<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:32.079> guess<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.739> nice<00:02:32.920> way

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
extremely rough I guess is the nice way

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.840 
extremely rough I guess is the nice way
to<00:02:33.220> put<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:35.160> really<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.310> terrible<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:38.850> looks

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
to put it really it's terrible it looks

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.110 
to put it really it's terrible it looks
all<00:02:40.090> right<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:41.459> there's<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.549> got<00:02:42.850> lots<00:02:43.030> of

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
all right but there's just got lots of

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.090 
all right but there's just got lots of
problems<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.590> spring<00:02:45.280> stands<00:02:45.670> proud<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.299> back

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
problems the spring stands proud on back

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.819 
problems the spring stands proud on back
it's<00:02:48.100> difficult<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.239> open<00:02:49.530> because<00:02:50.530> i<00:02:50.650> don't

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.529 
good thing is that I learned a lot on
this<00:04:31.320> project<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:32.070> learned<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.580> lot<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.419> things

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
this project I learned a lot of things

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.150 
this project I learned a lot of things
not<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:33.960> do<00:04:34.199> a<00:04:34.229> lot<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.620> things<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:35.039> do

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
differently so it's not a failure at all

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.420 
differently so it's not a failure at all
in<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.849> aspect<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.840> I'm<00:04:40.530> gonna<00:04:40.680> try<00:04:41.370> to

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
in that aspect so I'm gonna try to

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.029 
in that aspect so I'm gonna try to
sharpen<00:04:41.940> this<00:04:42.030> thing<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.510> see<00:04:42.810> if<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.470> can<00:04:43.860> keep

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
sharpen this thing and see if I can keep

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.339 
sharpen this thing and see if I can keep
from<00:04:44.190> cutting<00:04:44.550> my<00:04:44.639> fingers<00:04:45.000> off<00:04:45.200> opening<00:04:46.200> it

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
from cutting my fingers off opening it

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.870 
from cutting my fingers off opening it
and<00:04:46.380> how<00:04:46.740> long<00:04:46.919> will<00:04:47.099> try<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.370> use<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.729> a<00:04:47.789> little

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
and how long will try to use it a little

00:04:47.880 --> 00:05:03.460 
and how long will try to use it a little
bit<00:04:48.150> see<00:04:48.570> what<00:04:48.599> it<00:04:48.840> happens

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:14.510 

all<00:05:04.470> right<00:05:04.620> here<00:05:04.800> we<00:05:04.860> go<00:05:12.980> in<00:05:13.980> this<00:05:14.130> spring

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
all right here we go in this spring

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.640 
all right here we go in this spring
might<00:05:14.760> plus<00:05:15.389> in<00:05:15.570> half<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:16.020> is<00:05:16.230> what<00:05:16.410> one

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
might plus in half this is what one

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.980 
might plus in half this is what one
thing<00:05:16.889> I<00:05:17.010> learned<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:18.300> test<00:05:18.540> more<00:05:18.810> than

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
thing I learned it to test more than

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.110 
thing I learned it to test more than
anything<00:05:19.200> was<00:05:19.530> my<00:05:20.010> spring<00:05:20.340> temper<00:05:20.730> to<00:05:20.820> see<00:05:21.030> if

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
anything was my spring temper to see if

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:33.490 
anything was my spring temper to see if
I<00:05:21.240> have<00:05:21.450> it<00:05:21.620> right<00:05:30.050> that<00:05:31.050> was<00:05:31.290> dog<00:05:31.530> with

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
I have it right that was dog with
