00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.610
 hello welcome 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.600
 I'm going to make the cat 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.040
 and the cat step 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.000
 the spending step what needs to be done 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.060
 it's jumping 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.680
 placed more at the end of the object 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.940
 and me 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 but it would be the end 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:36.130
 open all three arms in between 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.120
 the strong ones until when you're at 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.579
 acts 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.960
 now it's okay for the flags 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.379
 and the cat would be smaller will try 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.379
 to show 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.250
 it is the most important thing 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.760
 amancio make the horn between them and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.760
 remove them 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.330
 if we will not find the object 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.470
 or we would get caught we would go 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.810
 head but I know that late 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.320
 and now I will show you the time 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.320
 coma 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.979
 Oh 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.290
 the highs is that never 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.360
 do not serve 0 to start 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.310
 but to begin with 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.340
 to this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.110
 training moves on casting 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.250
 forward 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.810
 and then I 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.810
 affiliate movement 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.400
 it's not that we dominate them we already know 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.090
 our feet of labor that we were not 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.600
 several times and already when we dominate 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.600
 with a lot of speed 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:24.350
 I recommend that there was no supported 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:27.190
 and there was no lack 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.190
 and there they go 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.100
 two 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.010
 two 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.150
 two 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.150
 and that appointment
