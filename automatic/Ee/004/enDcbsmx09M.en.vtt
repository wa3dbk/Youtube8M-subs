the<00:02:04.710> game<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.100> mean<00:02:05.280> maybe<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:05.850> people

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the game I mean maybe I would if people

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.580 
the game I mean maybe I would if people
want<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:06.930> uh<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:09.229> don't<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.349> be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
want but it would be uh I don't know be

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.690 
want but it would be uh I don't know be
more<00:02:10.770> like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
more like

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.670 
more like
news<00:02:13.700> show<00:02:14.150> or<00:02:14.360> an<00:02:14.420> update<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.930> don't<00:02:15.410> know<00:02:15.500> if

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680

with<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.730> way<00:02:16.819> they're<00:02:17.000> modeling<00:02:17.420> star

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
with the way they're modeling star

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.259 
with the way they're modeling star
citizen<00:02:18.200> as<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.769> game<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.670> don't<00:02:19.940> think<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
citizen as a game I don't think the

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.050 
citizen as a game I don't think the
traditional<00:02:21.069> LP<00:02:22.069> would<00:02:22.280> really<00:02:22.519> work<00:02:22.670> for<00:02:22.730> it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
traditional LP would really work for it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.850 
traditional LP would really work for it
it's<00:02:23.269> kind<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:23.959> MMO<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.560> would<00:02:24.769> be

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
it's kind of like an MMO it would be

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's kind of like an MMO it would be
like<00:02:24.980> lping<00:02:25.430> Eve<00:02:25.730> where<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.300> sort<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.540> you

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
like lping Eve where it's a sort of you

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.780 
like lping Eve where it's a sort of you
can<00:02:27.200> only<00:02:27.319> really<00:02:27.440> show<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:28.069> this<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.610> what

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
can only really show like this is what

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.330 
can only really show like this is what

go<00:02:42.739> in<00:02:42.860> pirate<00:02:43.400> I'm<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.510> opinion<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:45.079> I

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
go in pirate I'm of the opinion that I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.690 
go in pirate I'm of the opinion that I
think<00:02:47.660> everybody<00:02:48.380> wants<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.769> go<00:02:48.980> pirate<00:02:49.459> which

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
think everybody wants to go pirate which

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.430 
think everybody wants to go pirate which
is<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:50.120> having<00:02:50.360> an<00:02:50.630> ecosystem<00:02:51.319> where

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
is like having an ecosystem where

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.720 
is like having an ecosystem where
everybody<00:02:51.950> wants<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.519> carnivore<00:02:53.120> and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
everybody wants to be a carnivore and

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.900 
everybody wants to be a carnivore and
you<00:02:55.730> can't<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:58.220> mean<00:02:58.549> like<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
you can't have that so I mean like the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.089 
you can't have that so I mean like the
rebellious<00:02:59.450> thing<00:02:59.480> might<00:02:59.989> be<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.200> like<00:03:00.530> become

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
rebellious thing might be to like become

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.830 
rebellious thing might be to like become
an<00:03:01.250> honest<00:03:01.579> merchant<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.180> game<00:03:02.450> but

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
