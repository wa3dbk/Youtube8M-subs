there<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.580> capture<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.330> moment<00:02:16.900> with<00:02:17.080> that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
there and capture the moment with that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.320 
there and capture the moment with that
model<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.920> has<00:02:18.310> all<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.670> life<00:02:19.060> and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
model and it has all that life and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.280 
model and it has all that life and
vitality<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.290> moment<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:22.450> if<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:23.050> just

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
vitality of that moment but if it's just

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.650 
vitality of that moment but if it's just
got<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.470> moment<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:25.000> know<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.390> I'm

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
got that moment then you know if I'm

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.640 
got that moment then you know if I'm
looking<00:02:25.810> at<00:02:26.050> this<00:02:26.170> entire<00:02:26.620> spectrum<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.580> the

looking at this entire spectrum of the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.890 
looking at this entire spectrum of the
possible<00:02:30.540> right<00:02:31.540> then<00:02:31.840> well<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.860> moment<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
possible right then well that moment the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.850 
possible right then well that moment the
area<00:02:37.900> where<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.260> which<00:02:38.380> I'm<00:02:38.530> going<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.740> be

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
area where in which I'm going to be

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.620 
area where in which I'm going to be

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
working in claim may represent this

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
working in claim may represent this
really<00:02:41.110> large<00:02:41.350> swath<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:44.710> there's<00:02:44.890> all

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
really large swath here but there's all

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.520 
really large swath here but there's all
this<00:02:45.400> other<00:02:45.640> stuff<00:02:45.750> potential<00:02:46.750> iterations

what<00:02:47.830> could<00:02:47.980> those<00:02:48.130> rings<00:02:48.460> look<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.730> what

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
what could those rings look like what

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.340 
what could those rings look like what
happens<00:02:49.330> if<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.510> tweaked<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> pose<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.320> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
happens if I tweaked the pose here a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.680 
happens if I tweaked the pose here a
little<00:02:50.560> bit<00:02:50.770> this<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.520> where<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.760> take<00:02:52.060> what

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
little bit this is where I take what

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.420 
little bit this is where I take what
I've<00:02:52.810> done<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.320> moment<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.040> start<00:02:54.310> to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
I've done in the moment and I start to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.670 
I've done in the moment and I start to
expand<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.360> out<00:02:57.930> start<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.050> get<00:02:59.290> all<00:02:59.500> these

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
expand it out start to get all these

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.640 
expand it out start to get all these
different<00:02:59.980> iterations<00:03:00.760> all<00:03:00.940> these<00:03:01.120> different

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
different iterations all these different

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.830 
different iterations all these different
Possible's<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:02.910> there<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.480> I'm<00:03:04.510> going<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.750> say

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
Possible's in there so I'm going to say

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.880 
Possible's in there so I'm going to say
that<00:03:04.990> one<00:03:05.080> more<00:03:05.140> time<00:03:05.230> actually<00:03:07.710> been<00:03:08.710> a<00:03:08.740> while

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
that one more time actually been a while

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.980 
that one more time actually been a while
since<00:03:09.010> i<00:03:09.130> use<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.430> Crean<00:03:10.330> sharing<00:03:10.630> tool<00:03:10.780> so

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
since i use the Crean sharing tool so

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.850 
since i use the Crean sharing tool so
digital<00:03:13.990> allows<00:03:14.470> me<00:03:14.740> to<00:03:14.860> expand<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.730> possible

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
digital allows me to expand the possible

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.300 
digital allows me to expand the possible
but<00:03:17.880> clay<00:03:18.880> is<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:20.020> possible<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:21.010> that

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
but clay is that possible it is that

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.880 
but clay is that possible it is that
moment<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.720> here<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.930> am<00:03:23.050> I'm<00:03:23.320> what<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:23.740> took

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
moment so here I am I'm what I took

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.440 
moment so here I am I'm what I took
three<00:03:24.280> minutes<00:03:24.460> of<00:03:24.700> your<00:03:24.850> morning<00:03:25.240> here

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
three minutes of your morning here

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.440 
three minutes of your morning here
checking<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.020> out<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:27.820> is<00:03:28.000> one<00:03:28.210> thing

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
checking this out and this is one thing

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.060 
checking this out and this is one thing
I'm<00:03:28.570> working<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.320> then<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.470> come<00:03:29.710> in<00:03:29.860> here

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
I'm working on and then I come in here

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.670 
I'm working on and then I come in here
and<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.310> start<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.790> maybe<00:03:31.450> play<00:03:31.750> with<00:03:31.840> Z<00:03:32.260> spheres

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
and I start to maybe play with Z spheres

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.700 
and I start to maybe play with Z spheres
those<00:03:33.070> are<00:03:33.190> actually<00:03:33.490> two<00:03:33.610> different<00:03:33.640> size

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
those are actually two different size

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.010 
those are actually two different size
then<00:03:35.710> I<00:03:35.830> come<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.460> let's<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:37.450> try<00:03:37.840> one<00:03:37.990> of

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
then I come in and let's just try one of

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.660 
then I come in and let's just try one of
my<00:03:38.170> other<00:03:38.320> iterations<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:39.130> going<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.310> append

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
my other iterations I'm going to append

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.580 
my other iterations I'm going to append
a<00:03:40.680> sphere<00:03:41.680> 3d<00:03:42.540> I'm<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.840> move<00:03:43.990> that<00:03:44.050> down

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
a sphere 3d I'm going to move that down

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.110 
a sphere 3d I'm going to move that down
in<00:03:45.040> size<00:03:46.800> but<00:03:47.800> it'd<00:03:47.920> be<00:03:47.950> good<00:03:48.220> if<00:03:48.460> I<00:03:48.670> select<00:03:48.880> the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
in size but it'd be good if I select the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:58.820 
in size but it'd be good if I select the
right<00:03:49.270> tool<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:51.960> am<00:03:52.960> a<00:03:52.990> professional<00:03:55.950> trust<00:03:56.950> me

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
right tool I am a professional trust me

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.680 
right tool I am a professional trust me
let's<00:03:59.830> hide<00:04:00.040> these<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.670> then<00:04:01.270> I<00:04:01.360> can<00:04:01.510> switch

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
let's hide these and then I can switch

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.040 
let's hide these and then I can switch
over<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.990> black<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:06.390> then<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.510> can<00:04:07.690> use<00:04:07.870> things

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
over to black and then I can use things

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.750 
over to black and then I can use things
like<00:04:08.200> snake<00:04:08.620> hook

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.990 

and<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:17.239> can<00:04:17.389> start<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.720> pull<00:04:17.959> out<00:04:18.229> shapes<00:04:19.000> right

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
and I can start to pull out shapes right

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.379 
and I can start to pull out shapes right
and<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.389> i<00:04:20.419> am<00:04:20.540> just<00:04:20.900> in<00:04:21.199> 3d<00:04:21.769> i<00:04:22.040> can<00:04:22.910> use<00:04:23.360> my

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
and here i am just in 3d i can use my

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:34.150 
and here i am just in 3d i can use my
insert<00:04:24.139> tool<00:04:32.320> start<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.440> create<00:04:33.680> some<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.010> what

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
insert tool start to create some of what

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.620 
insert tool start to create some of what
that's<00:04:34.340> going<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.520> look<00:04:34.610> like<00:04:34.760> i<00:04:35.120> can<00:04:35.300> come<00:04:35.479> in

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
that's going to look like i can come in

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:46.480 
that's going to look like i can come in
here<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:35.840> insert<00:04:36.199> another<00:04:36.500> one

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.490 

you<00:04:47.150> know<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.419> can<00:04:47.569> really<00:04:47.750> start<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.139> play

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
you know and I can really start to play

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.800 
you know and I can really start to play
with<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:48.949> and<00:04:49.250> these<00:04:49.669> polygons<00:04:50.270> really<00:04:50.630> make

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
with this and these polygons really make

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.930 
with this and these polygons really make
a<00:04:50.840> difference<00:04:51.139> you<00:04:51.560> know<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.490> start<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:52.729> see

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
a difference you know and start to see

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.520 
a difference you know and start to see
what<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.210> is<00:04:53.389> going<00:04:53.509> to<00:04:53.569> look<00:04:53.720> like<00:04:53.780> but<00:04:54.410> then

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
what this is going to look like but then

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.080 
what this is going to look like but then
I've<00:04:54.680> got<00:04:54.710> these<00:04:55.009> other<00:04:55.250> things<00:04:55.610> that<00:04:55.729> I<00:04:55.880> can

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
I've got these other things that I can

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.350 
I've got these other things that I can
do<00:04:56.270> other<00:04:56.479> tools<00:04:57.020> not<00:04:57.410> just<00:04:57.949> the<00:04:58.759> snake<00:04:59.090> hook

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
do other tools not just the snake hook

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.150 
do other tools not just the snake hook
and<00:04:59.569> that's<00:04:59.990> what<00:05:00.139> I<00:05:00.169> really<00:05:00.620> i<00:05:00.740> started<00:05:01.069> doing

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
and that's what I really i started doing

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.860 
and that's what I really i started doing
this<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.490> was<00:05:01.580> like<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.789> gotta<00:05:02.030> tell<00:05:02.389> people

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
this and I was like I gotta tell people

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.020 
this and I was like I gotta tell people
about<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.349> because<00:05:03.530> it's<00:05:03.740> really<00:05:03.889> cool<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:05.000> I

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
about this because it's really cool so I

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.600 
about this because it's really cool so I
just<00:05:05.419> let<00:05:06.410> me<00:05:06.500> just<00:05:06.530> redo<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.039> whole<00:05:07.069> process

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
just let me just redo the whole process

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.790 
just let me just redo the whole process
so<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.210> see<00:05:08.389> it<00:05:08.509> I<00:05:08.660> created<00:05:09.259> something<00:05:09.530> like

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
so you see it I created something like

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.760 
so you see it I created something like
this<00:05:10.069> and<00:05:10.310> then<00:05:11.000> I<00:05:11.270> went<00:05:11.449> into<00:05:11.569> geometry<00:05:12.229> I

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
this and then I went into geometry I

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.430 
this and then I went into geometry I
went<00:05:13.370> into<00:05:13.490> shadow<00:05:13.849> box<00:05:14.180> all<00:05:14.900> right<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.050> left<00:05:15.319> it

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
went into shadow box all right I left it

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.529 
went into shadow box all right I left it
at<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.590> default<00:05:15.860> resolution<00:05:16.280> is<00:05:16.729> fine<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.240> I

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
at the default resolution is fine and I

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.649 
at the default resolution is fine and I
just<00:05:17.720> hit<00:05:17.840> shadow<00:05:18.050> box<00:05:18.580> okay<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:20.360> key<00:05:20.630> thing

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
just hit shadow box okay the key thing

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.820 
just hit shadow box okay the key thing
that<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:21.110> want<00:05:21.259> to<00:05:21.319> do<00:05:21.409> is<00:05:21.500> make<00:05:21.530> sure<00:05:21.680> that

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
that you want to do is make sure that

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.649 
that you want to do is make sure that
you've<00:05:22.069> got<00:05:22.280> something<00:05:22.819> up<00:05:23.090> here<00:05:23.330> something

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
you've got something up here something

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.350 
you've got something up here something
down<00:05:23.960> here<00:05:23.990> because<00:05:24.500> shadow<00:05:24.979> box<00:05:25.340> is<00:05:25.610> going<00:05:26.300> to

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
down here because shadow box is going to

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.350 
down here because shadow box is going to
come<00:05:26.659> in<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:26.960> fill<00:05:27.259> this<00:05:27.530> area<00:05:28.180> it's<00:05:29.180> going<00:05:29.300> to

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
come in and fill this area it's going to

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.730 
come in and fill this area it's going to
be<00:05:29.449> a<00:05:29.479> little<00:05:29.630> bit<00:05:29.750> above<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.319> little<00:05:30.590> bit<00:05:30.740> below

so now i can press ctrl click and drag

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.260 
so now i can press ctrl click and drag
okay<00:05:36.560> i<00:05:36.590> can<00:05:36.710> turn<00:05:36.949> transparency<00:05:37.699> on<00:05:37.849> and<00:05:38.150> i

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
okay i can turn transparency on and i

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.540 
okay i can turn transparency on and i
like<00:05:39.080> to<00:05:39.199> turn<00:05:39.349> ghost<00:05:39.680> off<00:05:39.889> when<00:05:40.099> i<00:05:40.130> do<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.340> this

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
like to turn ghost off when i do it this

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.830 
like to turn ghost off when i do it this
way<00:05:40.759> and<00:05:40.970> then<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:46.240> then<00:05:47.240> start<00:05:47.479> to<00:05:47.569> play<00:05:47.810> with

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
way and then and then start to play with

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.439 
way and then and then start to play with
these<00:05:48.080> designs<00:05:48.610> so<00:05:49.610> I'm<00:05:49.699> literally<00:05:50.000> playing

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
these designs so I'm literally playing

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.990 
these designs so I'm literally playing
with<00:05:50.719> this<00:05:50.870> in<00:05:51.139> 3d<00:05:52.150> just<00:05:53.150> seeing<00:05:53.449> you<00:05:53.599> know

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
with this in 3d just seeing you know

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.110 
with this in 3d just seeing you know
what<00:05:56.000> does<00:05:56.180> this<00:05:56.300> potentially<00:05:56.930> look<00:05:57.110> like

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
what does this potentially look like

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.930 
what does this potentially look like
I've<00:05:59.120> got<00:05:59.449> this<00:05:59.630> issue<00:06:00.320> with<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.919> angle<00:06:01.639> of<00:06:01.759> it

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
I've got this issue with the angle of it

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.879 
I've got this issue with the angle of it
and<00:06:02.120> all<00:06:02.180> of<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:02.360> but<00:06:02.719> this<00:06:03.320> at<00:06:03.500> least<00:06:03.680> gives

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
and all of that but this at least gives

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.430 
and all of that but this at least gives
me<00:06:04.039> a<00:06:04.099> chance<00:06:04.340> to<00:06:04.490> to<00:06:04.969> play<00:06:05.270> and<00:06:05.479> see<00:06:05.690> I<00:06:05.900> can

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
me a chance to to play and see I can

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.350 
me a chance to to play and see I can
still<00:06:06.680> continue<00:06:07.009> to<00:06:07.190> adjust<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:08.000> shape

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
still continue to adjust the shape

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.309 
still continue to adjust the shape
though<00:06:11.080> and<00:06:12.909> then<00:06:13.909> make<00:06:14.539> sure<00:06:14.570> you<00:06:14.810> do<00:06:15.020> this<00:06:15.169> on

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
though and then make sure you do this on

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.770 
though and then make sure you do this on
both<00:06:15.349> sides

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.010 

okay<00:06:21.780> all<00:06:22.470> kinds<00:06:22.890> of<00:06:22.920> craziness<00:06:23.340> ensues<00:06:24.020> but

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
okay all kinds of craziness ensues but

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.900 
okay all kinds of craziness ensues but
it's<00:06:25.170> pretty<00:06:25.410> cool<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.920> just<00:06:26.340> be<00:06:26.520> able<00:06:26.610> to<00:06:26.760> come

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
it's pretty cool to just be able to come

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.080 
it's pretty cool to just be able to come
in<00:06:27.150> and<00:06:27.440> say<00:06:28.440> well<00:06:28.680> i<00:06:28.950> don't<00:06:29.370> know<00:06:29.520> where<00:06:29.910> i

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
in and say well i don't know where i

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.670 
in and say well i don't know where i
want<00:06:30.450> this<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.960> go<00:06:31.370> but<00:06:32.370> now<00:06:32.580> I'm<00:06:33.380> expanding<00:06:34.380> my

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
want this to go but now I'm expanding my

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.740 
want this to go but now I'm expanding my
possible<00:06:35.520> the<00:06:35.640> moment<00:06:36.030> which<00:06:36.150> I<00:06:36.300> was<00:06:36.420> with<00:06:36.600> the

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
possible the moment which I was with the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.670 
possible the moment which I was with the
model<00:06:37.140> and<00:06:37.640> kind<00:06:38.640> of<00:06:38.930> visualizing<00:06:39.930> this<00:06:40.110> now<00:06:40.650> I

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
model and kind of visualizing this now I

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.250 
model and kind of visualizing this now I
can<00:06:41.010> actually<00:06:41.130> see<00:06:41.610> it<00:06:41.730> and<00:06:41.820> make<00:06:42.030> it<00:06:42.060> real<00:06:42.420> so

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
can actually see it and make it real so

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.590 
can actually see it and make it real so
I<00:06:43.590> hope<00:06:44.010> this<00:06:44.220> was<00:06:44.430> useful<00:06:44.460> is<00:06:45.060> really

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
I hope this was useful is really

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.640 
I hope this was useful is really
