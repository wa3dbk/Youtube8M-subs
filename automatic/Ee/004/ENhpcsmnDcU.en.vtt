 the interests of potatoes and the original 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.050

 four cooked potatoes 800 grams is what 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.020
 what do we need 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.990
 one 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.220
 liter of milk also on top of that 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.739
 you need an orange peel there what 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.630
 have you followed with a twig of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.820
 cinnamon 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.010
 After the calera twig we went to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.510
 a teaspoon of vanilla there what 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.850
 they have the liquid vanilla that they look at 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 the concentrated supermarkets exact and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 half a cup of passers too 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 important because it's part of the recipe 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.310
 that we have today besides that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.370
 just look at the milk a cup of 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.470
 condensed milk and with that love and so much 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.510
 it's pure love and coughing ingredients and desert 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.280
 It is the most important incident inches 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.080
 ingredients look carefully what we are going to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.070
 make in a saucepan in which you are 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.300
 this side I'm passing you the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.520
 ingredients of the grounds are going 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.369
 pouring we have then the liter of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.860
 milk you pour it in a saucepan but 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.360
 that milk we are going to infuse and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.180
 work is to say that we are going to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.830
 provide flavor and aroma 2 to and function 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.720
 we are going to put the shell of a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.610
 orange so that there it begins to drop 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.270
 flavor and aroma especially 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.920
 we should add the cinnamon stick and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.600
 we are going to add the concentrate of 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840
 vanilla that also gives a lot of flavor and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.429
 also a lot of aroma 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.250
 let's leave also I'm going to add 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.840
 these things are not for infusion 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.950
 but they are to hydrate cough I'm going to 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.110
 take this liquid so that it 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.599
 go ideas nothing is the liquid without 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.519
 error are already dehydrated by your candle 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.599
 bars but when we put them in a 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.400
 hot liquid they start to 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.569
 hydrate before I will take advantage of that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.940
 are merging the milk and milk 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.069
 added is for appointments only to be 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.230
 hydrate and salgado are bigger without 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.480
 doubt caught with you truth that if it were 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.660
 a small shovel letter of palita you 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.129
 I asked what I found 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.890
 interesting to see that there is a dessert 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.599
 made with potatoes a dessert made to 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.370
 potato base this I already had it 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.290
 talked about without wines that you have to 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.239
 try the dessert of my sister Sara 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.730
 facio about rico riki is made of 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.530
 potatoes pacifiers not if I have to try 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.090
 and I have to share it because 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.709
 the truth is that it is very economical to see 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.450
 for when we have many at home 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.160
 because there are families that are more than 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.590
 four imagine making this dessert 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.720
 stopping and different 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.519
 the original we're going to stop besides 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.170
 gs of that of the economic thing that is well 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.490
 easy to do then without merging 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.500
 the milk 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.300
 there we are going to let rum fervor and that 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.130
 begin to see you little bubbles and in 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.320
 When you see these little bubbles, we leave them 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.090
 about three minutes so for that 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.980
 grab well sauces that you voted for 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.690
 everything basically and I on this side him 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.550
 I give the instructions of the easy potato 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.020
 we just have to cook it if 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.450
 he wants you removed from the beginning 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.070
 the shell to accelerate the process the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.530
 we put in a saucepan and if we have it 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.930
 to put salt but very little when 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.840
 we make salty dishes with potatoes and the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.610
 added this enough salt for it to be 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.290
 well well seasoned the potato but as in 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.200
 this time the potato goes for a dessert 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.660
 it was going to be sweet just that I just put a 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.530
 little salt just for you to have 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.180
 taste because the potato without flavor 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.950
 perfect I was going to ask why 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.630
 so that it gives flavor to the beard once 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.150
 which is cooked we remove skin and the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.410
 We cut into small pieces then 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.640
 since it is in small pieces nothing 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.340
 more to help start grinding 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.580
 well we put the blender 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.780
 exactly and I put four potatoes 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.100
 secret agreement that I do here are 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.319
 for four people 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.439
 you are calculating a potato 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.819
 currently exactly but I put 4 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.650
 potatoes and then if you go to the market 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.420
 to the supermarket, it will always vary 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.340
 The size can be four 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.349
 He told me 44 against a little girl 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.049
 then I gave myself the task of thinking them and 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.030
 then approximately 1 800 0 if the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.380
 family is abundantly founded 20 potatoes 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.280
 and here we already have all 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.280
 technical program 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.570
 I come faster so I do not come in 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.000
 the potato the gentleman face of low 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.639
 very well already broke boil he already did 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.320
 little bubbles spent those three minutes what 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:42.500
 I have to strain then the flight is 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:53.840
 milk has a lot of flavor we have here 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:55.340
 it is very very important the liquid is 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.990
 hot or when you put it on the 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.720
 blender what cap a camera is generated 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.849
 expert strike and then the potato is left 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.509
 in the text we want that then the 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.880
 Honey is not so hot and he screamed at me 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:14.980
 presents the screaming she is indie 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:18.280
 and then look I'm going to start grinding 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.280
 the king 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.870
 now they will be because it is not going to 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.870
 can already grasping shapes 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:36.599
 is alive is for that 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.409
 and the potato is walking 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:06:00.120
 but completita to the extent 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.949
 and another that is already ready that does not have 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.620
 that there is not even one infinite and it is not 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.220
 coming out 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.760
 the more or less 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.760
 what I said is something different 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.580
 We urge that there is no really smooth 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.080
 tercetos to not even a single 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.690
 I hope that he does not have a single 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.720
 only small piece of potatoes out there was like 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.400
 save what clients are and was 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.350
 but well that personó I am not even a 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.000
 just a little piece but in the opportunity 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.530
 of the blender that grinds well alright well 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.330
 well because if it does not really have 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.340
 let it be released, but wait 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.710
 I do not think there is any missing if this is 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.680
 the swimsuit but something is missing we have 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.630
 to add the sweet 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.699
 I really want to do it well 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.410
 economic and do not want to spend on the can 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.240
 of milk as you can with sugar 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.490
 how much sugar would be more or 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.979
 less a half cup would be good I do not 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.660
 I am very very sweet but if you can 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.280
 add up to three quarters of 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.759
 a cup rafaela and why not also of 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.759
 the páramos 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:30.900
 at least how much time do we have to 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.900
 be mixing there are another five minutes 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.610
 in 25 more minutes we rectify action 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:42.400
 with a job that do a little more 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.470
 of sugar if you are very sweet and 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.240
 have to express so they are left with 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.509
 a texture of cream to see we are going to 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.509
 try out 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.990
 the whole thing is left with the 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:54.789
 texture like a pastry cream but 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.889
 I'll leave it there, trying to tell me about parties 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:59.889
 are and me while to give this area 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:03.190
 the heart and the phrase of the devil goes 

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:08.490
 super pretty beam of your life a dream and 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.490
 of your dream a reality or yes
