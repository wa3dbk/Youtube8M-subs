00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.240
 ok we've seen together the basics of this 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.010
 new method now we're going 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.230
 working together examples 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.119
 story that you really see how 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.580
 it's going on we'll start with a 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.240
 pretty simple black crush example 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.250
 crooked 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.090
 so just for this example I'm going 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.470
 show you how do we 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.450
 would have worked with the old 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.360
 method on the black who falls on the 1 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.450
 the eia nothing the two hooks are on 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.219
 May 2 and May 3 , the black 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.199
 play the country nothing and learn the two 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.900
 loved ones on leucate and clans these 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:40.680
 methods it makes us one and two and 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.110
 three and four and one and two and three 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
 and four 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 the new method what is it going 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.630
 we do and we will type the times 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 only on the right hand 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.610
 we'll have a bunch this first time all 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.290
 simple we are going to have two piles the tata d2 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.149
 eighth in the second and then again 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.250
 a bunch the third time and tata on 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 your fourth time you have to do well 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.219
 attention to the cross to make them to the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.450
 good speed for that like gilles in 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.049
 the previous part we will start with 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.090
 count on a tempo there one and two and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.139
 three and four and that's our 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.399
 close your ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:22.259
 tension does that in order we first 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:23.909
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.679
 this is our first rhythm 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.539
 that we worked together as 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.770
 usually alesi slowly repeated the 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.889
 many times to know him by 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.459
 heart and you should not have too much of 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:33.840
 troubles 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.609
 do not hesitate to always work and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.990
 that the first method history of good 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.880
 check that your crush on the good 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.979
 speed do not hesitate to register 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.819
 also to compare the two methods if 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.159
 you can not do very well 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.539
 listen while you work and 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.969
 the essentials of the method try it 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.649
 times and one reads as and when 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.899
 what is written a black is to 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 cross is reached we go right away 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.689
 so see a second example with a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.659
 setbacks but it gets complicated 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.459
 little bit we'll see black black half 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.189
 sighs crunch between the mishap and 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.919
 a black then that we do on 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.919
 first time you went after you go 

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:10.830
 to have the setback is utah and we have 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.239
 a bunch this fourth time again a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.740
 the key if other setbacks are 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.190
 at the right speed at the same speed as 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.760
 wrote down 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.770
 recently make us shame at a hta and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.480
 put it in order with the rest 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:31.090
 of rhythm it makes us kkm ta ta ta ta 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.770
 here again I repeat it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.230
 train you complain once on this 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.520
 pace be attentive to the speed 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.260
 your loved ones and your mishaps 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.930
 do not hesitate to count the 1 es2 es3 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.980
 es4 and before to get in the bath 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.990
 and it should go by without too much 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.930
 problems another example name that is going 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.570
 mix black crooked setback two 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.710
 cross we have a little bit of everything 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.480
 we do this I make you directly 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:03:00.100
 without explanation your ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.870
 your ta ta ta ta as we can 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.310
 see our loved ones are alain speed the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.320
 off-beat I repeat it because he 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.220
 you really have to get it back 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.750
 if you have a little trouble on this 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.160
 rhythm a little trick that you can 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.870
 use whenever you have a 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.100
 setbacks you could not have used 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.620
 on the previous rhythm we will see it 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.330
 here started by replacing your half 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.790
 sigh crooked by two eighth two 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
 real normal quaver there is a little more 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.440
 easy to do 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:27.580
 it makes us this your ta ta ta ta ta 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.260
 once upon a time you have 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.850
 do that all you have to do 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.940
 is that there is a heap among all 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.900
 eighth notes that must be replaced by a whole 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.090
 the goal being to put it in the right place 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.470
 this is for sure the third time that we 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.790
 do your ta ta ta ta ta you can you 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.480
 entail chaining the two is a 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.150
 very good exercise 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:52.239
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.200
 So that's a little advice to 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.519
 every time you have a setback 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.900
 in a rhythm if you have a little bit 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.300
 wrong with this against time 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.760
 replace it with two close ones it will be a 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.280
 little bit easier to work 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.350
 new white example of black eighth note 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.760
 so here you have to do a little bit of 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.750
 mental transformations when I have 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.290
 spoke briefly in the part 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.239
 former 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.860
 the white is the same thing as if they 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.060
 played a black followed by a sigh 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.670
 since you have to play on the 1 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.299
 we do not touch neither the two neo and one 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.980
 new and of the 2 of the black neck it is with one 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.979
 will sigh we do not do anything 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.139
 all about the a2 kata kata to start at 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.789
 be used to that and a black 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:36.249
 who feted if we do that afterwards case 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:38.830
 that your ta ta ta ta it is also 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:40.599
 simple that we'll do one last 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.060
 little example there as a little bit 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:47.409
 of black tip transformations and 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.139
 eighth notes ebony so here we have a 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.249
 black dotted that starts on the 1 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.919
 we are at the crook that will fall on the 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.879
 and 2 if we think a little bit 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.919
 do the same thing as if we had to 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.529
 play a black one of a mishap 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.210
 monday sopir crooked then we have two 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.750
 black close as in the rhythm at 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:10.000
 previous what will we do ta ta ta 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.199
 do not you all time 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.490
 you have a rhythm in front of your eyes 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.800
 do not hesitate to rewrite it under the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.689
 black form of ebony against time 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.310
 sigh it's a little bit your four elements 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.569
 basic with which you can 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.169
 write all the rhythms we've seen 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.120
 until now 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.560
 do not hesitate also as I already said 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.430
 previously to replace the mishaps 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.710
 by two relatives 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.499
 it will help you a little bit 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.659
 work ok that's it for the examples 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:33.339
 we saw a few today you 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.330
 can completely rework all 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.939
 examples that we saw in the 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.490
 previous rhythm course and also all 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:40.569
 the rhythmic artothèque that can 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.789
 this method can be applied on 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.020
 it does not matter how much I leave you 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.669
 a last little tip 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.899
 when you work rhythms with 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.300
 this method try to memorize them 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:51.370
 as soon as possible 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.319
 read the rhythm done two or three times and 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.909
 this method by having the leaf or 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.009
 the screen under the eyes by watching him 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.779
 and after looking away do not look 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.199
 more is just trying to make 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.939
 head 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.379
 you will see that it is very easy to 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.449
 memorize a rhythm saying it is 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.149
 almost like if you sing a few 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.349
 a little song you know 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.969
 So why do you practice memorizing the 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.439
 rhythms this will be very convenient after 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.639
 also for playing them on the guitar if 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:13.389
 you know them by heart it will be 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.699
 much simpler 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.870
 so that's all we have to say 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.270
 on this new method 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.439
 we will talk about it more extensively in 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.969
 upcoming courses as and 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.949
 we will see other rhythmic notions 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.300
 and I tell you next time on 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.529
