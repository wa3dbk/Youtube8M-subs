00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
so the other day I was at Hastings and I

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.509 
so the other day I was at Hastings and I
found<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.150> blazing<00:00:06.750> Sonic<00:00:07.109> 2<00:00:07.259> pack<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.770> I

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
found a blazing Sonic 2 pack and I

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.650 
found a blazing Sonic 2 pack and I
figured<00:00:09.320> well<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.940> really<00:00:11.940> wanted<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.420> blaze

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
figured well I really wanted the blaze

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.780 
figured well I really wanted the blaze
because<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.290> haven't<00:00:13.860> seen<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> anywhere<00:00:14.280> else

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
because I haven't seen it anywhere else

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.599 
because I haven't seen it anywhere else
there<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.000> only<00:00:15.120> 14<00:00:15.660> bucks<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:17.220> might<00:00:17.490> as

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
there was only 14 bucks so you might as

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.970 
there was only 14 bucks so you might as
well<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.090> didn't<00:00:19.020> ever<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> Sonic<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
well I didn't ever have the Sonic so I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.710 
well I didn't ever have the Sonic so I
figured<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.130> would<00:00:23.160> take<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.670> spare<00:00:23.939> one<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
figured I would take the spare one and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.220 
figured I would take the spare one and
turn<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.060> Sonic's<00:00:27.060> brother<00:00:27.359> Minich<00:00:30.230> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
turn it into Sonic's brother Minich the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.110 
turn it into Sonic's brother Minich the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.620 
first thing I had to do was dismantle
the<00:00:33.270> Sonic<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> kind<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> sad<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.510> be

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the Sonic and kind of sad but had to be
