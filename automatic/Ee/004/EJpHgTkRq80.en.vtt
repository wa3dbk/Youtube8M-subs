00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.990 
but personally I wouldn't be able to do
that<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.710> said<00:01:43.770> youtube<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that just because as I said youtube and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.359 
that just because as I said youtube and
streaming<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.840> only<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.439> hobby<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.040> something

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
streaming is only a hobby it's something

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
streaming is only a hobby it's something
I<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.670> my<00:01:47.729> spare<00:01:47.850> time<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.540> something<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I do in my spare time it's something I

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.109 
I do in my spare time it's something I
do<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.770> relax<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.460> something<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.060> I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
do to relax it's not something that I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.969 
do to relax it's not something that I
want<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> spend<00:01:51.420> hours<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.470> hours<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> hours

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
want to spend hours and hours and hours

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.209 
want to spend hours and hours and hours
on<00:01:53.250> end<00:01:53.460> into<00:01:54.170> because<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.409> wouldn't<00:01:55.860> enjoy<00:01:56.189> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
on end into because I wouldn't enjoy it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.780 
on end into because I wouldn't enjoy it
and<00:01:56.520> doing<00:01:57.240> daily<00:01:57.540> videos<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.770> suck<00:01:59.549> the
