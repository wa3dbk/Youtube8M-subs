00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.520
 I want a new video of me 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.950
 Today you like my bags 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.929
 Collections show collections on the left 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 only in quotes because of me 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.410
 I only own three bags 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.719
 I use these three bags 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 however, that is regularly, that means everyone 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 day or every other day and I have 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.600
 Simply stated sometime my 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.710
 take the same bags again and again 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.029
 why do you actually have the others ? 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.949
 still and these bags are also like 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.330
 many garments i had so 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.189
 emergency solutions I have become but 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.869
 actually not used that much 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 and that's why I sorted out 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.630
 and I only have three bags left 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.660
 i love and really constantly user 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.579
 here you are here you see mine now 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.520
 first handbag normal 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.170
 Handbag in black with two handles 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.000
 Of course, I see that quite loosely 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.050
 throwing one's arm over how one can do that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 so know of a conventional 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.879
 luckily, yes, too 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 still come with such an end that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.379
 means I can cut that in front 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.660
 and backendran cut and can 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.859
 I wear the bag quite differently though 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.960
 I like to over the shoulder 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.840
 i cant pretend that i do that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.010
 is this a bit multi purpose 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.689
 and if that is not enough for me 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.549
 and I want you all out of the way 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.200
 For example, driving a bike can be 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.380
 I also put my head through it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.080
 and the bag on the back carry what 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.180
 I find that very convenient for that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.479
 different occasions and events 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 I can use the same bag 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.250
 this is the second bag too and 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.920
 black but much bigger and bigger 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.150
 I've still something hanging off and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 source is a bracelet of amnesty 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.329
 international 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.729
 that's my thing and that's why 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.220
 like to have it because I just 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.630
 would like to present 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.120
 Of course, again very easy 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.910
 and then I want to 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.860
 my last bag show my last 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.660
 Bag is a very conventional backpack 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.200
 but it is really important for me 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.490
 in my active sporting life and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.120
 The backpack has three different ones 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.190
 fan a small front a middle 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.500
 fold and a big one in the back and on 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.730
 he has human side so much again 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.179
 people that was all mine 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.530
 bags i know they all black 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.180
 are and maybe for one or 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.370
 others are all the same 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.500
 but for me they all have one 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.350
 difference and that one bag 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.370
 I use it when I go away or when 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.290
 I go to work 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 the bag I use when I am 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.390
 a little something to shop with me 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.510
 do not need to use plastic bags and the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.640
 I use this third bag for sports 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.870
 example, so every bag has with me 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.920
 a function and you will too 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.600
 used regularly 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.520
 I know that there are many others 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.870
 nice bags out there but for 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.030
 I'm just not the focus 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.230
 on it a lot of bags 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.030
 accumulate and always a new one 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.590
 It certainly will be there 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.239
 again one or the other to come 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.220
 maybe not because black 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.170
 A summer color is a must, though 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.280
 I now have these bags over one 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.350
 very long period again and again 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.450
 used and will continue to do so 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.640
 use and if you break one 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.290
 or just worn down 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.060
 Of course, I'll exchange them too 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.680
 against a new and not the old one yet 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.239
 to keep 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.180
 that's the way I act with it 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.519
 can understand that it is hard 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.010
 sort out bags and give away 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.260
 But the question is how many bags 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.670
 we really need in life is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.459
 did not make my decision 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.630
 I can live well with myself and I can 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.769
 I hope you enjoy the video a bit 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.140
 Maybe it was inspiring 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.670
 sort out and wish you everything 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.630
 good and see you in the next video 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.630
 makes good tips
