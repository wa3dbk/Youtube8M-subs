00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hello, I want to show a new watch 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.710
 called to the village stb thousand me there she 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.349
 and was announced at the exhibition in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.929
 las vegas earlier this year they became 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.809
 continuation of a series of hours with bluetooth 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.480
 who are paired with an iphone and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.109
 thus display different notification 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 duplicate part of the function which 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.830
 the user may not notice when 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.470
 the phone is in your pocket after clothes 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.480
 when let's say there are a lot of notifications and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.420
 the person simply noticed with the help 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.149
 hours and it can not leave without 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.079
 attention but first a few words about 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.480
 the device itself in this case is the clock 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.140
 made in the traditional style 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.030
 that is, it is about the sport kind of gadget he 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 happens two colors my case is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.469
 black orange combination and in addition 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.719
 it is still black and gray that is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.170
 this part of the bottom it will be in gray 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.680
 less throw a watch stand 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.600
 being in the water in general is not 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.560
 typical of many devices to force with 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.939
 they can swim there to swim in the sea 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.610
 stated that they have a working time 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:17.250
 is up to 2 years old it's big to me 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.049
 It seems a plus for a device with bluetooth 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.470
 general dreams that are often 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.750
 you need to charge there 1 2 3 but can 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.229
 be 1 week but here everything is autonomy 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.640
 as usual at a height as far as 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.640
 the clock functionality here in 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.070
 basically they are standard there time in 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.290
 different time zones alarm clock and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.439
 Of course, their watch has an indication icon 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.110
 bluetooth av were visible on the left small 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.829
 circle and corresponding icon i.e. 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.770
 there is light q nicely blue 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.270
 colors on the orange line where it is written 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.680
 each notification is displayed that is 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.680
 if the transition comes to the phone 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.659
 messages there they run you run off the line 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.790
 Of course it is inconvenient to read because 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.869
 what 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.550
 follow all the text and read 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.120
 practically spell but nevertheless 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.800
 this option is present here is flown around 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.160
 It turns on very simply you need to click here 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.569
 this button and grief from the hall now 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.150
 bluetooth is off if it is 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.880
 reiterate it accordingly 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:31.019
 starts looking for the phone itself all this 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.069
 phone here we work with iphone a 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.750
 In this case, you can see that the application is 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.540
 discovered device connects 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.290
 phone quickly if the husband is 10 seconds and at least 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.769
 no more a can show that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.420
 actually offers this program 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.190
 can customize the language when the application 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.260
 just went to work in Russian now 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.220
 already in English the hour has already appeared 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.459
 Russian language support has been expanded 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.870
 what a nice application management 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.000
 this work hours and code from auto to 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.140
 that is, there is only music 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.049
 music is the base player iphone ovsky 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:18.299
 which one can manage 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.090
 tracks that is forward back 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.250
 volume and playback bands all 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.390
 basic functions can be understood by 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.390
 these button which is very convenient 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.489
 In addition, there is a function in the settings 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.739
 phone search, that is, hours if not 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.700
 phone nearby but you can watch 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.489
 miss this opportunity and then the phone 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.840
 will alert in itself with the help of one 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.940
 of the three tunes are still tuned 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.830
 volume if the clock and turned on 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.540
 sufficiently long distance phone 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.519
 there is a risk of loss of communication then they will give about 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.140
 know this by either vibrating or 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.200
 sound well or just information on the screen 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.139
 actually standard function hours 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.359
 several alarm clocks timer again 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.590
 it is clear that some of the actions are duplicated with 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.389
 phone screen and in my opinion this 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.530
 very cool because you do not need to enter 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.360
 data on your watch is much more convenient 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.840
 do it from the phone is not 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.750
 with a little small screen themselves 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.250
 clock the clock introduces these notifications then 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.350
 there is 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.610
 duplicate the challenge with such a few 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.750
 modes for sound indication list 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.010
 I will not see it on the screen 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.010
 devices mail again 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.320
 message calendar but all these 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.760
 additional notice that what he 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.120
 the phone comes all will be pressed 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.870
 the type of vibration is adjusted 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.480
 so that you can more accurately and better feel 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.790
 the presence of hours on the hand is the same time 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.740
 signal well in general it seems to me the settings 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.890
 quite a lot and yet 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:22.570
 necessary for a person to be 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:26.440
 always up to date and did not miss what 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.390
 you link plus there is still a reference site 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.800
 where you can see add information 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:37.150
 about this watch and their possibilities so 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.430
 One can advise the Cassio clock to 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.230
 you thousands to everyone who wants some 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.390
 practical gadget to your iphone which 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.240
 will work as helping them 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.310
 means and pressure plus they have such 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.140
 bright attractive design in the spirit 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.390
 traditions repent and with all this they 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.930
 not very expensive official price in 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:59.110
 Russia to put 5190 rubles on the background 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.580
 their watches are diversified which more and more often 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.460
 more often with microsd itâ€™s not that expensive 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.190
 for a gadget that works about two 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.420
 years as the manufacturer says protected 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.420
 moisture and dust 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.870
 logically convenient management is good 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.840
 soft 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.870
 where all the necessary drinks he tells 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.850
 on all events that come on 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.330
 iphone and if you want some such 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.860
 Duplicate gadget can this watch

 principle of some serious flaws 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.640
 they don't have and generally thought the user 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.530
