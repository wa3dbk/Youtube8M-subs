Can you say hello to everyone in English? Only joking. Today we have a special guest with us, Emis Killa.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Hello Emis, welcome back. We also have Chantal from London. Fenni from Indonesia. Amanda from Malta.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Also we have Pasquale Salvione, Tania - a huge Milan fan - and Manuel, Stephan's brother. Welcome Manuel.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What does it feel like for someone like you, who has played on the local pitches of your town

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and for a lot of small local teams, to walk out onto the San Siro pitch, score a goal and hear the crowd roar.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It is an incredible feeling. It is a double emotion because I was always a Milan fan from a very young age.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What did you say to Insigne and would you like to play alongside him one day?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Of course I would because Lorenzo is a great player who did very well last season and is also doing very well this year.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Could you ever fall in love with an ordinary girl that you might meet in a bar?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Of course because I am a normal guy.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I wanted to know how a shy guy like you manages to be so serious in front of the cameras?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Benedetta is next to me helping me out.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The number 92 has brought me luck until now so I will keep wearing it. Just like my mohawk, which is not going away. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Untouchable! Let's go to Claudio Gervasoni, journalist of Men's Health. Hello Claudio.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
As far as sacrifices are concerned, this regards your diet.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Is there any food that you cannot resist eating and how do you manage your diet.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I always eat healthy food, plain pasta, bresaola, chicken breasts.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Thank you to all the guys, we have come to the end of our Hangout. Goodbye to everyone.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Bye bye!
