00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.140
 and elvis the conspiracy theories of the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.640
 any Hayles conspiracy quererte 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.400
 the trans believes there are 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.539
 yes, I do not think that not all 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.860
 problem is that some are put in 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.939
 march to discredit those who are 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.339
 true but as paranoia as you can 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:38.540
 let it never existed actions 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:40.280
 sister of the classics the truth I 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.720
 I think there have been organisms 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.370
 good earth stories 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.829
 Órbigo hollow earth are a 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.290
 classic is also a classic but has 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.809
 there have been organism that have been created to 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.979
 the conspiracy and it is also curious 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.290
 in conspiracy is something very 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.479
 saucer for example 20th century the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.470
 international communist international 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.750
 communist in a created organ 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.460
 expressly to conspire from Moscow 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.229
 to subvert from within the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.330
 capitalist countries proclaimed it 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.390
 openly and they had their agents their 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.159
 spies their communist parties with great 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.710
 intelligence legalized by each of 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.200
 the countries who wanted to destroy and 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.640
 in the end that has been like that is a fact in the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.210
 history therefore conspiracies if he has 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.310
 there were new achievements until very recently 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.659
 it has been Freemasonry I say that until 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.240
 little because you do not need to conspire anymore 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.590
 comes to power or wall-e all the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.789
 conspiratorial organisms city has 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.159
 there has always been a long history without 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.240
 put ourselves in these things that lead from 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.780
 the 11th century 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.729
 but let's go if what it says what 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.380
 they made fernando is completely obvious 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.520
 everyone knows him for all I 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.329
 I had to translate a thing called 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.789
 the configuration of katelynas to see it 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.159
 but but what when talking about 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.039
 conspiracionismo what is said is that 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.329
 there is a single cause some types in a 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:04.280
 be that they effectively master all 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.100
 disappointments in another way that is not no 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.899
 a Greek case the case in the case 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.429
 merits fame 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.110
 the problem is exactly the opposite 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.520
 the problem is that agencies 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.069
 'rating' that is to say the agencies that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.290
 have to say it's reliable or not 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.540
 to the player otherwise we have then 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.129
 coup advances is to say that if the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.260
 we see around here and we ask that it is 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.999
 do this that always happens in economic 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.370
 because what you want if you are 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:32.459
 dedicated to finances that people 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.530
 invest that in general business 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.150
 configure also then what to your 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.819
 day is what it is that for the first time 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.980
 they begin to approach the truth no longer 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.420
 is that they are now getting 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.579
 stupidly negative but they have 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.010
 been 'alice in the country of 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.120
 wonders but could be the bias 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.040
 bullish conditions the economy and the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 key is a little guidance and support 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.430
 now the risks of how good with 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.680
 the ads with the condition is clear 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.810
 but we are there the users not only 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.400
 I need as advertised or our 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.379
 likes or our need for meals 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.389
 different fats and more and more 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.819
 different is true 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.579
 if there is once again I not ask for a 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.290
 propaganda ministry would be publicist 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.000
 has done much more to impose but 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.439
 much more can impose the uses and 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.090
 customs for subverting the and by 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.280
 impose on us what we have today the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.689
 advertising that I will read pajín by in the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 page has ultimately moved to the 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.819
 laughter and in some cases according to the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.040
 compassion 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.420
 but these advertising agencies are 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.219
 the ones that are not really saying there 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.810
 many types of family and a guy comes out 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.239
 mounted in a van of I do not know what 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.889
 story that as a child picks up that is 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.439
 son is a marriage to another year son 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.760
 the second and then to a child of I do not know 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.379
 where it says do not think more about this one 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.010
 it's not from your neighbor is in this kind of 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.900
 things and has done that has done much more 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.459
 from here but much more damage than 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.290
 absurd decisions of a ministry that 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.310
 it has a fairly limited scope and that 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.290
 besides the population then in rows the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.810
 dodge as good we do not go to it I do not 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.169
 I quite agree with you but 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.699
 much in the enormous influence of this of 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.889
 the advertising 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:07.280
 lopez is that I this people that the only 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.319
 what he wants is to sell a beer or some 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.030
 panties or whatever in about 100 were of 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.259
 interest does not have an ideological interest 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.090
 what it does is follow yes yes yes what 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.889
 is to follow is to follow fashion 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.400
 ideological that is what the brand 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.590
 power 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.930
 the intellectual is no longer talking about 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.070
 intellectual state closed and there are 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.070
 a symbiosis 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.710
 pajín gives equal no the law the law 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.720
 consider as something moral is to say yes 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.570
 this is allowed this is ropes that 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.090
 he answers me of what is not entirely 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.460
 true it is not clear that they make ideology 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.449
 because because in a consumer society 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.000
 Interested in promoting and interested that 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.979
 certain type of joints to form 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.229
 own that the mayor with a publicist 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.449
 is not beginning what I do for 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.009
 where is it but this is how we are going to see how 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.960
 it's like that if it's not selling beer 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.370
 advertising agencies say what 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.130
 are projecting are certain type 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.050
 of ideal society because it interests in 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.639
 function for example that is consumed 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.169
 more than today they add more families and 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.490
 said that families with children by 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.120
 example talking is publicized 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.120
 advertising 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.860
 I was leaving 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.069
 today very well is excess 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.310
 there are millions of people living their 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.310
 lives 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.870
 unconscious 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.810
 and its artificial 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.430
 you want me to understand that most 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.590
 they are not prepared to be 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.830
 deactivated and many are so 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.300
 habituated depend so much on the system 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.300
 who would fight to protect him 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.379
 while it does not resist does not 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.400
 we distribute we make you one of the 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.009
 our 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:50.349
 before we kill you we make your brain 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.349
 perfect before destroying it 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.680
 and later 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.660
 when there is nothing left 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.110
 except repentance and love to the great 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.110
 brother
