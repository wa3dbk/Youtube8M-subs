 consultation through the web running 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.230
 points 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.509
 Caesar trains 2 hours of running at a pace 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.900

 daily so your needs 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.750
 daily carbohydrates are between 5 and 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.760
 7 grams per kilo of weight 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.320

 grams per kilo for a broker like 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.940
 example I propose the following 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.039
 meals a breakfast that will consist of a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.140

 cereals type wheat corn flakes or 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.870
 rice a better natural fruit juice and 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.480
 two toasts with marmalade 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.540
 the food should include a serving of 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.060

 with cuttlefish for dessert you can have yogurt or 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.500
 fruit or both dinner should also 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.750
 include a carbohydrate fraction the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.330
 purpose of ingesting carbohydrates in the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.210
 dinner is to refill the deposits of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.360
 muscle and liver glycogen and achieve 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.270
