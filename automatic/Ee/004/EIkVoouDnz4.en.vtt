00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello to everyone I am jazz 360 and 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 I bring you this new video and this time 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.630
 commented gameplay of call of duty black 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.610
 ops 2 once again we are on stand or the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.080
 Border city duel by teams that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.360
 it's usually the usual game mode since 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.520
 you know and this time I bring you a 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 gameplay with the evo scorpion is about 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.539
 in his rifle and I spoke to him I said 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.100
 which in my opinion is not very good 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 all weapons are really good 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.689
 but for me it's not going very well because 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.580
 Well, for certain reasons and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 be at the time of shooting that maybe 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 the peephole is moving or what 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 be this time I take it to hair if 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.260
 I'm not wrong, I think it was one of the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 first games that the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.129
 final result is from 23 to 5 already 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 you know regular games whenever 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 Anyone can never take 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 you are going to see something extraordinary there drop 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 shott to finish with the first and good 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.629
 this weapon also has pretty things 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.879
 quite positive is worth the rest 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.469
 the other equipment that I have already know 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.039
 which is always the same 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.690
 missile air attack and even those 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.280
 advantages are usually equal I carry the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 ex-people shocked now you know 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.760
 all those good things 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.250
 you have seen forgiveness what 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.890
 being the enemy in superiority of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 height and say it ends with me but 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.250
 good nothing happened 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.320
 today I want to comment a little something for 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.719
 which I will talk more about 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.909
 background and then and we'll talk about 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.770
 one thing about ego is worth I have here 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.409
 to Luis who is waiting with me and 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.670
 I will now give way to speak what 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.470
 I wanted to comment on that already 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.929
 some video soon to comment 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.229
 I wanted you red resurgence I wanted you 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.450
 returned to the channel a series that is treated 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.009
 of questions and answers will be 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.649
 questions and answers will be something else 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.030
 interactive because we will do it more or 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.890
 less when I the serious thing will be 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.929
 questions in real time even if you 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.149
 the video you see the next day or 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.490
 in two days whatever it is but good 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.909
 As I say, I will comment more in depth 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.310
 about that topic and well, I think that 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.959
 a little more I also have to comment 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.360
 Well, what I told you, not about the 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.039
 games that go back up dead network 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.289
 redemption go back up battlefield 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.209
 yes, always very occasionally 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.759
 sometime then once a week or 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.019
 maybe once every two weeks and good 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.700
 the last issue that was me 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.349
 comment is the subject that I have commented 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.720
 at the beginning that later we would play more 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.420
 background it's about the subject regarding 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.610
 eurogamer online I'm here with 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.810
 the ceo of euro sees more online louis than 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.520
 such good elÃ­as very good all boys 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.959
 and well, let's talk a little bit about what 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.050
 that would be the incorporation of 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.720
 how page as a sponsor not to the web of the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.110
 brothers online and the entity itself does not 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.239
 good 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.610
 Luis knows a lot more about this about this 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.959
 so I 'm going to step on him and one 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.020
 explain what you see fit 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.390
 louis yes good it has been a great 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.030
 news for us after so much 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.220
 effort in these months to advance in 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.230
 the competitive for giving it the best these 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.480
 users so a leading brand 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.450
 avant-garde as how page has bet 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.030
 for us he has decided that we are the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.360
 sponsor good to be people is to be 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.220
 ours and more specifically because it is going to 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.790
 take care of most of the prize 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.230
 from the xbox series of the ps3 series and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.600
 of a third series that we're 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.730
 thinking about doing if about fifa about the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.530
 role depends 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.099
 and good has also brought us material 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.440
 for the streamings for you the 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.080
 caster as you know will give us 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.459
 material for tournaments and good at 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.400
 definitively they want to collaborate in a 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.910
 very close with us I already have to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.340
 it has been in the bet 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.340
 on his part is quite powerful that 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.500
 we were not really expecting and we are going to 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.300
 give everything 100% for them we liked 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.490
 We also get rid of the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.730
 chants can be to know media in the 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.100
 direct competition from them but there 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.990
 to follow, you have to move forward, you have to give 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.770
 the best as I have told you before in 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.460
 other users and the truth that we see it 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.480
 very well for the future and facing the 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.730
 I presented 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.490
 eurogamer will help us a lot and on 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.250
 all now with the new design the 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.790
 start of the leagues with all the truth 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.900
 that I have these have gone pretty well and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.730
 little more to add 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.070
 elias and ultimately a good 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.040
 investment of money in this 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.830
 occasion not economically speaking and of 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.020
 material also allow us to do the 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.270
 selenis with its products and well 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.460
 outside future projects maybe I'm 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.380
 sure that they will also collaborate what 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.820
 that entails what also entails a 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.710
 great responsibility on our part 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.810
 of the social network 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.280
 exactly good to keep working on 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.560
 the same line that we are doing 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.550
 As you all know, responsibility of 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.390
 hard work serious 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.460
 and little else would be good because if you do not have 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.230
 nothing but add louis let's go 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.880
 dismissing this gameplay you do not have 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.190
 nothing more to add not yet to some subject 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.410
 that you want to play on a luck to 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.830
 all the equipment the series are already 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.420
 closed so much that more hits enter 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.160
 is going to be the thing very much requires the 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.240
 teams in concrete lasts almost five 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.910
 months yes but they will be close to 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:19.130
 700 euros the winner yes thing that we 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.510
 honor and from ps3 are two teams and it's going to 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.770
 last less to achieve about three months 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.010
 personally personal bring near 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.720
 also 400 insurance or 500 are of 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.800
 the few pages, not to mention the only one 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.509
 that bets on the competitive ps3 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.780
 and we want to show it that way 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.849
 I also know and well, for my part 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.770
 The only thing left for me to say is that 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.960
 when there is some streaming that still 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.039
 Well, no, I will not dare to specify 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.780
 the days in which the 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.819
 streamings nor the schedules in case there 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.250
 some change or something like that but 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.690
 I will try to warn in these videos worth 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.970
 for example imagine what there is today 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.159
 Sorry, there's a streaming because I'll tell you hey 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.349
 today at 8 a.m. to 9 o'clock or whenever there is a 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.849
 streaming is valid so you can go through the 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.159
 channel of gamers that is where they will be 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.139
 retransmissions directly and 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.340
 louis nothing and said goodbye little more than 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.080
 in full 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.020
 thank you very much for giving us the opportunity 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.470
 to be here in your bakeries and a 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.800
 greeting
