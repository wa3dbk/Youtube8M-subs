00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.580
 hello we are currently so 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.680
 with Vincent Bouchard Director of the 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.840
 communication and marketing 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.400
 delonghi and that's why we 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.699
 meet you today for us 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.330
 talk about this wonderful machine to 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.530
 coffee but not that no indeed because 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.360
 it's a coffee machine 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.309
 but above all it's a coffee robot 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.960
 as it's commonly known as why 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.339
 because it's a product that comes from 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.360
 of the professional world like those that 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.159
 can be found in restaurants in 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.890
 the bars and that has the characteristic 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.350
 to use coffee grains directly 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.659
 to make his espresso then the coffee 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.879
 grains it's an almost brutish coffee that 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.559
 has been roasted but which allows 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.900
 keep all its aroma since it is at 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.150
 moment when one realizes one's drink that the 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.970
 grain she is going to be crushed inside 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.070
 and that because he is words he is going 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.330
 be able to make espresso directly 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.880
 so there is a freshness a aroma 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.650
 incomparable from using coffee 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 grains and can we still use the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.760
 ground coffee exactly there is still 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.590
 for those who wish to decaffeinated 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.230
 the opportunity to put directly here 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.600
 ground coffee to select so the 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.760
 coffee that is used by ground coffee 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.290
 and to be able to enjoy a decaffeinated 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.270
 without removing the grain in the tank 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.040
 okay and in terms of maintenance this 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.540
 need 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.830
 so it's very simple there is no 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.270
 a lot of good maintenance like all 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.430
 machines that heats water there 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.530
 there may be tartar so you have to 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.630
 regularly after a certain 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.920
 number of coffees descale the device 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.450
 so it's just a product that 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.490
 we put in the water tank and who 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.780
 then going to do an internal cleaning of 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.880
 all parts where water flows 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.830
 okay but will there eventually be 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.600
 other manipulations to do our 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.070
 site two years and this is also a side 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.130
 practice of the device you have a 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.660
 access here directly from the infused hours block 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.440
 the hours infuse block this is a little the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.330
 heart of the machine 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.369
 it is this heart that will seek them the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.950
 fresh ground coffee and who 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.390
 then will go under the water outlet 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.980
 which is brought to high temperature is 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.110
 under pressure to then realize 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.810
 directly the espresso in the cup 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.000
 so that's a block that should be 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.440
 clean under water every ten days 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.240
 from time to time if there is a little bit 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.790
 of coffee dust lying on it 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.230
 okay preface so he was looking for this 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.489
 that your good talk about what we 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.000
 It is therefore interesting to drink 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.590
 Coffee 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.300
 yes what can we do with this 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.040
 machine in fact one can pretty much everything 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.390
 do even more than coffee since 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.430
 it's a device I would say multi 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.019
 drink you directly see it 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.610
 here on the facade the possibility in 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.019
 pressing a single touch of 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.600
 realize either a latte a 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.190
 last macchiato cappuccino or even 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.140
 only hot milk you can 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.320
 course under the lights Accessories 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.540
 for that so here directly we go 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.620
 have the ability to vary the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.260
 height we will put a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.620
 obviously a cappuccino glass or at the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.450
 tma cateau when we want to realize it 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.370
 the idea is that when we prepare a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.290
 milk-based drink so you take off 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.659
 directly here the steam nozzle you 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.680
 fill in here your tank to the east 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.430
 that you can put directly into 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.810
 the fridge 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.420
 it is often advisable to use a 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.340
 was rather cool connect you 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.140
 then directly your device and there 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.360
 you have the opportunity by putting 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.519
 your cappuccino cup by pressing 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.019
 the cappuccino touch to achieve first 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.640
 your milk froth and then you 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.049
 are going to have the espresso that will flow 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.510
 to make you a delicious cappuccino 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.730
 in one fantastic touch and so 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.620
 all this actually this time it's 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.010
 to realize a very small Sunday 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.750
 in an extremely format I would say 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.620
 compact so it's really the size 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.739
 manikin of this robot with a capacity 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.870
 so always extremely important 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.690
 for grain and for water but a 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.280
 reduced size to 19.5 cm so that's 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.720
 important because more and more we have 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.400
 on the work plans enormously 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.150
 of devices so this device you 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.129
 can see her more next door without 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.049
 clutter and so I would say too much 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.340
 embarrassing your work plan so the 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.750
 technological feat it was 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.480
 keep all the functions of the robot 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.790
 coffee even more the multi drinks but 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.959
 in a minimum size well thank you 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.959
 a lot and I beg you
