where it rains a little bit more cool
tree<00:02:13.280> they<00:02:13.519> give<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> lot<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.000> fruit<00:02:14.950> they<00:02:15.950> grow

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
tree they give a lot of fruit they grow

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.070 
tree they give a lot of fruit they grow
really<00:02:16.400> fast
