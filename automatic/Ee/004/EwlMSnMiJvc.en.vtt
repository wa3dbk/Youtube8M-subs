I<00:00:00.319> don't<00:00:01.319> know<00:00:01.380> let's<00:00:01.589> make<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.429> on<00:00:02.490> why

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
I don't know let's make a video on why

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.390 
I don't know let's make a video on why
this<00:00:02.850> right<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:03.540> mean<00:00:03.750> one<00:00:04.020> what<00:00:04.950> else<00:00:04.980> we're

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
this right I mean one what else we're

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.400 
this right I mean one what else we're
four<00:00:05.819> videos<00:00:06.350> make<00:00:07.350> more<00:00:07.649> visions<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:09.410> I'm

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
four videos make more visions so I'm

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.439 
four videos make more visions so I'm
just<00:00:10.800> gonna<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:11.130> good<00:00:14.030> okay<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> uh<00:00:17.010> huh<00:00:17.699> ladies

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
just gonna be good okay so uh huh ladies

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.060 
just gonna be good okay so uh huh ladies
and<00:00:18.570> gentlemen<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:18.990> said<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.320> X<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> zero

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
and gentlemen we said that X to the zero

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.179 
and gentlemen we said that X to the zero
equals<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:20.850> well<00:00:21.449> let's<00:00:22.410> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.010> think

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
equals one well let's kind of think

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.590 
equals one well let's kind of think
about<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.369> couple<00:00:23.670> things<00:00:23.850> first<00:00:24.240> thing<00:00:24.510> we

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
about a couple things first thing we

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.769 
about a couple things first thing we
need<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.199> X<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.390> divided<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.420> X

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
need to know is X to the a divided by X

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.589 
need to know is X to the a divided by X
to<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> B<00:00:28.140> equals<00:00:28.769> x<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.429> minus<00:00:30.060> B<00:00:30.210> right

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to the B equals x to the a minus B right

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
to the B equals x to the a minus B right
that's<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> rule<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.560> dividing<00:00:31.949> X<00:00:32.070> points

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that's the rule of dividing X points

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.020 
that's the rule of dividing X points
correct<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.170> also<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:35.030> any

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
correct then we also know that any

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
correct then we also know that any
number<00:00:38.300> divided<00:00:39.300> by<00:00:39.450> itself<00:00:39.860> equals<00:00:40.860> one

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
number divided by itself equals one

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.479 
number divided by itself equals one
right<00:00:42.920> that<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> next<00:00:44.219> thing<00:00:44.460> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
right that was the next thing that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.250 
right that was the next thing that
expressed<00:00:45.000> correct<00:00:46.969> okay<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.140> going

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
expressed correct okay so what I'm going

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.939 
expressed correct okay so what I'm going
to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.680> how<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:51.500> how<00:00:52.500> could<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.770> maybe

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to do is how would how could I maybe

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.510 
to do is how would how could I maybe
rewrite<00:00:53.309> X<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> 0<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:56.100> maybe<00:00:56.280> if

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
rewrite X to the 0 so it would maybe if

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
rewrite X to the 0 so it would maybe if
like<00:00:56.820> express<00:00:57.300> something<00:00:57.570> well<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
like express something well what if I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
like express something well what if I
wrote<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.489> X<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> 3<00:01:02.329> divided<00:01:03.329> by<00:01:03.359> X<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
wrote out X to the 3 divided by X to the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.840 
wrote out X to the 3 divided by X to the
3<00:01:06.920> X<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> 3<00:01:08.610> divided<00:01:09.000> by<00:01:09.060> X<00:01:09.270> -<00:01:09.450> 3<00:01:10.520> 1<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.729> know

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
3 X to the 3 divided by X - 3 1 we know

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.280 
3 X to the 3 divided by X - 3 1 we know
that<00:01:12.000> equals<00:01:12.090> 1<00:01:12.479> right<00:01:14.600> well<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:15.840> about<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that equals 1 right well what about if I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.109 
that equals 1 right well what about if I
followed<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> rules<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.220> subtraction<00:01:17.700> what

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
followed the rules of subtraction what

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:30.550 
followed the rules of subtraction what
else<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.540> equal

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.100 

you<00:01:30.980> guys<00:01:31.100> see<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.300> really<00:01:33.100> x2<00:01:34.100> um<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.840> X

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
you guys see that so really x2 um so X

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.620 
you guys see that so really x2 um so X
to<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.470> zero<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:37.130> going<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.730> equal<00:01:37.940> one<00:01:38.150> that

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
to the zero is going to equal one that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.550 
to the zero is going to equal one that
make<00:01:38.780> sense<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:39.260> any<00:01:40.070> number<00:01:40.490> does<00:01:41.030> make<00:01:41.180> sense

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
make sense so any number does make sense

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.760 
make sense so any number does make sense
okay

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
okay

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.570 
okay
did<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.490> follow<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:44.060> understand<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:45.340> okay

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
did you follow you understand this okay

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.550 
did you follow you understand this okay
Wells<00:01:46.820> expect<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.630> understand<00:01:47.990> any<00:01:48.260> number

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
Wells expect you understand any number

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.550 
Wells expect you understand any number
divided<00:01:48.830> by<00:01:48.920> itself<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.340> conform<00:01:49.760> right<00:01:50.560> then

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
divided by itself to conform right then

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.980 
divided by itself to conform right then
the<00:01:51.979> other<00:01:52.130> thing<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.460> anytime<00:01:53.150> you<00:01:53.750> have<00:01:53.930> a

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
the other thing is anytime you have a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.770 
the other thing is anytime you have a
model<00:01:54.530> or<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.830> number<00:01:55.270> with<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.360> next<00:01:56.600> point

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
model or a number with the next point

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.630 
model or a number with the next point
divided<00:01:57.320> by<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.530> same<00:01:57.890> base<00:01:58.220> with<00:01:58.550> an

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
divided by that same base with an

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.630 
divided by that same base with an
exponent<00:01:59.000> used<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.479> track<00:01:59.810> them<00:02:00.160> right<00:02:01.160> so<00:02:01.460> all

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
exponent used to track them right so all

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.420 
exponent used to track them right so all
I'm<00:02:01.790> saying<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:02.680> let's<00:02:03.680> just<00:02:03.740> pick<00:02:03.979> any<00:02:04.160> number

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
I'm saying is let's just pick any number

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.800 
I'm saying is let's just pick any number
it<00:02:04.490> doesn't<00:02:04.640> matter<00:02:04.880> as<00:02:05.300> long<00:02:05.360> as<00:02:05.509> they<00:02:05.720> have

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
it doesn't matter as long as they have

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.859 
it doesn't matter as long as they have
the<00:02:05.869> same<00:02:06.050> base<00:02:07.000> any<00:02:08.000> number<00:02:08.420> divided<00:02:08.750> by

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
the same base any number divided by

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.280 
the same base any number divided by
itself<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.649> going<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.550> equal<00:02:10.820> one<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.140> know

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
itself is going to equal one you know

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.800 
itself is going to equal one you know
that<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.400> what<00:02:13.520> I'm<00:02:13.640> saying<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.030> since

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
that but what I'm saying is since

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.690 
that but what I'm saying is since
they're<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.050> same<00:02:15.200> number<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.459> same

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
they're the same number with the same

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.530 
they're the same number with the same
exponents

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
exponents

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.840 
exponents
you<00:02:18.110> could<00:02:18.260> also<00:02:18.410> by<00:02:18.770> using<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.310> rules<00:02:19.550> of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
you could also by using the rules of

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.970 
you could also by using the rules of
exponents<00:02:20.030> by<00:02:20.420> following<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.140> rule<00:02:21.440> you're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
exponents by following this rule you're

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.380 
exponents by following this rule you're
also<00:02:22.190> going<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.550> get<00:02:22.670> X<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.060> zero

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
also going to get X to the zero

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.750 
also going to get X to the zero
therefore<00:02:24.380> these<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:24.980> exactly<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
therefore these have to be exactly the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.020 
therefore these have to be exactly the
same<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.750> they're<00:02:26.870> equal<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.200> each<00:02:27.320> other<00:02:28.030> okay

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
same so they're equal to each other okay

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.600 
same so they're equal to each other okay
so<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.170> mean<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:31.070> I'm<00:02:31.220> saying<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.489> by

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
so I mean it's just all I'm saying is by

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.949 
so I mean it's just all I'm saying is by
using<00:02:31.880> our<00:02:32.090> rule<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.360> exponents<00:02:32.570> we<00:02:32.930> can

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
using our rule of exponents we can

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:33.880 
using our rule of exponents we can
understand<00:02:33.530> that

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
understand that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.810 
understand that
that's<00:02:34.040> why<00:02:34.220> X<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.610> zero<00:02:34.820> equals<00:02:35.239> one

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.100 

this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.750> like<00:02:40.960> this<00:02:41.260> guy's<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:41.800> like
