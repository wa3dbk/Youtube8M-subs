00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
never thought for it's really like that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
never thought for it's really like that
it's<00:00:51.809> true<00:00:52.110> yeah<00:00:52.680> they're<00:00:53.100> bigger<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

think<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.770> app<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.160> used<00:00:56.430> by

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
think that that app would be used by

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
think that that app would be used by
women<00:00:57.030> more<00:00:57.180> frequently<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.289> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
women more frequently this is what I
