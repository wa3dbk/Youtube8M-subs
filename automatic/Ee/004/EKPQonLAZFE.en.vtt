hey<00:00:06.450> everybody<00:00:06.930> its<00:00:07.140> Jason<00:00:07.740> Blaha<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.580> and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
hey everybody its Jason Blaha here and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.150 
hey everybody its Jason Blaha here and
today<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.719> want<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.200> jump<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.620> little<00:00:10.800> further

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
today I want to jump a little further

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
today I want to jump a little further
into<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.580> topic<00:00:11.880> about<00:00:12.620> hamstrings<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
into this topic about hamstrings and the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.470 
into this topic about hamstrings and the
deadlift<00:00:14.429> because<00:00:14.849> there's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> lot<00:00:15.450> of

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
deadlift because there's a lot of

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.330 
deadlift because there's a lot of
misinformation<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.680> let's<00:00:16.920> jump<00:00:17.190> into

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
misinformation here so let's jump into

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
misinformation here so let's jump into
this<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.970> further<00:00:18.210> now<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.570> guys<00:00:18.840> know

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
this a little further now you guys know

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.870 
this a little further now you guys know
I<00:00:19.109> discussed<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.800> yesterday<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.609> video

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
I discussed it yesterday in this video

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.679 
I discussed it yesterday in this video
here<00:00:22.220> discussing<00:00:23.220> Sebastian's<00:00:23.939> debate<00:00:24.480> with

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
here discussing Sebastian's debate with

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.960 
here discussing Sebastian's debate with
me<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> then<00:00:25.920> over<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> did<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.789> video

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
me and then over here I did a video

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
me and then over here I did a video
discussing<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.960> advanced<00:00:28.439> powerlifting

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
discussing more advanced powerlifting

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.950 
discussing more advanced powerlifting
techniques<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.150> deadlift<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.929> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
techniques for the deadlift and what I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.669 
techniques for the deadlift and what I
use

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
use

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.979 
use
so<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.579> will<00:00:32.730> clarify<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> points

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
so that will clarify some of the points

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.170 
so that will clarify some of the points
and<00:00:34.200> there's<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.130> some<00:00:35.579> points<00:00:35.940> being<00:00:36.120> made

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and there's some some points being made

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
and there's some some points being made
out<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.960> people<00:00:37.469> who<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> very

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
out there that people who have a very

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.119 
out there that people who have a very
basic<00:00:39.510> understanding<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.500> human<00:00:40.829> physiology

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
basic understanding of human physiology

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
basic understanding of human physiology
and<00:00:41.730> biomechanics<00:00:42.480> mate<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.379> they're<00:00:43.530> not

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and biomechanics mate but they're not

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.260 
and biomechanics mate but they're not
really<00:00:43.860> correct<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.399> it'll<00:00:44.760> understand

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
really correct because it'll understand

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.250 
really correct because it'll understand
that<00:00:45.750> primary<00:00:46.260> functions<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> muscle<00:00:48.050> do<00:00:49.050> not

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that primary functions of muscle do not

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
that primary functions of muscle do not
always<00:00:49.649> determine<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:51.239> muscles<00:00:51.570> are

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
always determine what muscles are

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.799 
always determine what muscles are
recruited<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.320> movement<00:00:52.610> now<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.480> point<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
recruited in a movement now the point is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
recruited in a movement now the point is
it<00:00:54.930> made<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> number<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> people<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it made by a number of people that the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.709 
it made by a number of people that the
glutes<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.910> more<00:00:57.059> dominant<00:00:57.480> than<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
glutes are more dominant than the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
glutes are more dominant than the

hamstrings and hip extension however it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
hamstrings and hip extension however it
has<00:00:59.820> been<00:00:59.969> documented<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:01.160> almost<00:01:02.160> 20<00:01:02.609> years

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
has been documented for almost 20 years

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.390 
has been documented for almost 20 years

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
now and understood and sports physiology

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.330 
now and understood and sports physiology
that<00:01:05.430> hip<00:01:05.850> extension<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:07.590> absolutely<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that hip extension is absolutely a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
that hip extension is absolutely a
function<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> hamstring<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> hamstrings

function of the hamstring the hamstrings
are<00:01:10.080> considered<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> primary<00:01:11.850> mover<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
are considered to be a primary mover and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.469 
are considered to be a primary mover and
hip<00:01:12.930> extension<00:01:13.560> even<00:01:13.740> though<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.060> glutes<00:01:15.330> are

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
hip extension even though the glutes are

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
hip extension even though the glutes are
still<00:01:15.659> involved<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> deadlift

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
still involved and the deadlift

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.460 
still involved and the deadlift
very<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:18.090> involves<00:01:18.540> hip<00:01:18.659> extension<00:01:19.229> any

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
very much involves hip extension any

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.249 
very much involves hip extension any
type<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> deadlift<00:01:20.220> does<00:01:20.810> now<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.869> could<00:01:22.110> get

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
type of deadlift does now we could get

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.789 
type of deadlift does now we could get
into<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> debate<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:24.439> things<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
into the debate about things like the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.740 
into the debate about things like the
stiff<00:01:26.100> leg<00:01:26.369> deadlift<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> Romanian

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
stiff leg deadlift or the Romanian

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
stiff leg deadlift or the Romanian
deadlift<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.470> they're<00:01:28.619> purely<00:01:29.040> hip

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
deadlift because they're purely hip

the biceps femoris effectively as its
primary<00:01:38.460> function<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.409> true

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
primary function and that would be true

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
primary function and that would be true
that<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> primary<00:01:41.460> function<00:01:42.030> of

that that is not the primary function of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
muscles it should be clear to you that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.929 
muscles it should be clear to you that
those<00:01:48.659> movements<00:01:48.960> still<00:01:49.560> absolutely<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
those movements still absolutely and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
those movements still absolutely and
unequivocally<00:01:51.229> would<00:01:52.229> activate<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> biceps

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
unequivocally would activate the biceps

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.550 
unequivocally would activate the biceps
femoris<00:01:53.670> they're<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:54.990> activate<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
femoris they're not going to activate it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
femoris they're not going to activate it
as<00:01:55.680> much<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.100> activate<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> other<00:01:56.820> heads

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
as much as they activate the other heads

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.069 
as much as they activate the other heads
however<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> fact<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.399> muscle<00:02:00.079> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
however but the fact is a muscle is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.490 
however but the fact is a muscle is
being<00:02:01.469> activated<00:02:02.420> as<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.659> primary<00:02:04.170> mover

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
being activated as a primary mover

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.999 
being activated as a primary mover
during<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.890> lift<00:02:06.259> even<00:02:07.259> though<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> head

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
during a lift even though it has a head

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.589 
during a lift even though it has a head
that<00:02:08.160> isn't<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> primary<00:02:08.940> mover<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> still

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that isn't a primary mover it still

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.290 
that isn't a primary mover it still
shares<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> common<00:02:10.349> insertion<00:02:11.129> at<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:12.090> very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
shares a common insertion at the very

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.940 
shares a common insertion at the very
bottom<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
bottom and that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.670 
bottom and that
will<00:02:14.400> cause<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.150> contract<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:16.050> activate

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
will cause it to contract and activate

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.540 
will cause it to contract and activate
just<00:02:17.130> not<00:02:17.340> maximally<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:20.160> goes<00:02:20.340> back<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
just not maximally and this goes back to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
just not maximally and this goes back to
a<00:02:20.700> basic<00:02:21.090> understanding<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.720> physiology<00:02:22.020> now

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
a basic understanding of physiology now

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.870 
a basic understanding of physiology now
I'm<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.890> discuss<00:02:23.280> something<00:02:23.490> further

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
I'm going to discuss something further

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.640 
I'm going to discuss something further
because<00:02:24.240> people<00:02:24.660> didn't<00:02:24.930> grasp<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.470> was

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
because people didn't grasp but I was

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.230 
because people didn't grasp but I was
saying<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.190> yesterday's<00:02:26.730> video<00:02:26.910> I'm<00:02:27.150> gonna

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
saying and yesterday's video I'm gonna

00:02:27.240 --> 00:03:03.590 
saying and yesterday's video I'm gonna
link<00:02:27.600> me<00:02:27.750> doing<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.170> deadlift<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.860> again<00:03:02.600> now

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
link me doing a deadlift here again now

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.080 
link me doing a deadlift here again now
for<00:03:03.780> those<00:03:03.870> curious<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.530> was<00:03:04.710> 240<00:03:05.610> kilos<00:03:06.000> I

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
for those curious that was 240 kilos I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.050 
for those curious that was 240 kilos I
was<00:03:06.210> working<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.630> beltless<00:03:07.080> or<00:03:07.850> 530<00:03:08.850> pounds

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
was working with beltless or 530 pounds

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.920 
was working with beltless or 530 pounds
for<00:03:09.390> those<00:03:09.510> who<00:03:09.690> don't<00:03:09.870> use<00:03:10.110> metric<00:03:10.920> system

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
for those who don't use metric system

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.030 
for those who don't use metric system
now<00:03:12.930> one<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.290> things<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.590> notice<00:03:13.770> with

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
now one of the things you notice with

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.800 
now one of the things you notice with
that<00:03:14.190> I'm<00:03:14.400> gonna<00:03:14.760> make<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.150> argument<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that I'm gonna make the argument that a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.660 
that I'm gonna make the argument that a
properly<00:03:16.410> done<00:03:16.680> deadlift<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.430> that

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
properly done deadlift like that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.340 
properly done deadlift like that
absolutely<00:03:18.770> uses<00:03:20.390> knee<00:03:21.390> flexion<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:22.080> get<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
absolutely uses knee flexion to get the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.480 
absolutely uses knee flexion to get the
weight<00:03:22.500> started<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.250> absolutely

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
weight started and it absolutely

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.630 
weight started and it absolutely
recruits<00:03:24.420> all<00:03:24.660> heads<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:26.130> hamstring<00:03:26.610> and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
recruits all heads of the hamstring and

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.430 
recruits all heads of the hamstring and
they're<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.000> very<00:03:27.300> effective<00:03:27.930> for<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
they're just very effective for the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.110 
they're just very effective for the
hamstrings<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.220> initial<00:03:29.760> part<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
hamstrings for the initial part of the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.480 
hamstrings for the initial part of the
movement<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> hamstrings<00:03:32.100> are

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
movement and then the hamstrings are

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.949 
movement and then the hamstrings are
pulled<00:03:32.910> out<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.270> we've<00:03:33.390> got<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> lot<00:03:33.720> more

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
pulled out that we've got a lot more

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.210 
pulled out that we've got a lot more
because<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.530> fact<00:03:34.740> that<00:03:34.830> I'm<00:03:35.010> using

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
because of the fact that I'm using

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.000 
because of the fact that I'm using
thoracic<00:03:36.120> rounding<00:03:36.600> but<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.380> initial<00:03:37.830> break

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
thoracic rounding but the initial break

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.460 
thoracic rounding but the initial break
off<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.340> floor<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.630> hamstrings<00:03:40.140> play<00:03:40.440> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
off the floor the hamstrings play a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.650 
off the floor the hamstrings play a
massive<00:03:40.980> role<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.850> they<00:03:42.630> are

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
massive role in it and they are

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.080 
massive role in it and they are
maximally<00:03:43.440> contracted<00:03:44.040> all<00:03:44.220> heads<00:03:44.670> are<00:03:44.850> and

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
maximally contracted all heads are and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.240 
maximally contracted all heads are and
the<00:03:45.780> reason<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.380> you'll<00:03:46.590> notice<00:03:46.860> one<00:03:47.070> I

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
the reason is that you'll notice one I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.610 
the reason is that you'll notice one I
pull<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.730> slack<00:03:47.970> out<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.360> bar<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.810> pull

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
pull the slack out of the bar I pull

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.220 
pull the slack out of the bar I pull
myself<00:03:49.860> down<00:03:50.430> because<00:03:51.180> I'm<00:03:51.540> actually<00:03:51.720> pulling

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
myself down because I'm actually pulling

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.190 
myself down because I'm actually pulling
up<00:03:52.560> with<00:03:52.920> probably<00:03:53.640> four<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.660> five<00:03:54.870> hundred

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
up with probably four to five hundred

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.440 
up with probably four to five hundred
pounds<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.530> force<00:03:55.860> during<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.610> drop<00:03:56.820> down<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
pounds of force during the drop down to

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.770 
pounds of force during the drop down to
pull<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.780> slack<00:03:58.020> out<00:03:58.610> I'm<00:03:59.610> putting<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.150> massive

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
pull the slack out I'm putting a massive

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.900 
pull the slack out I'm putting a massive
amount<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.380> tension<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> hamstrings<00:04:02.730> and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
amount of tension on the hamstrings and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.900 
amount of tension on the hamstrings and
you<00:04:03.000> will<00:04:03.120> notice<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.750> am<00:04:04.020> still

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
you will notice that I am still

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.100 
you will notice that I am still
initiating<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:06.180> am<00:04:06.300> my<00:04:06.480> hamstrings<00:04:06.959> are

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
initiating I am my hamstrings are

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.590 
initiating I am my hamstrings are
contracted<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.489> am<00:04:08.580> initiating<00:04:08.880> just

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
contracted and I am initiating just

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.670 
contracted and I am initiating just
another<00:04:09.959> inch<00:04:11.330> maybe<00:04:12.330> more<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.900> knee<00:04:13.350> flexion

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
another inch maybe more of knee flexion

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.220 
another inch maybe more of knee flexion
as<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.160> break<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.120> weight<00:04:15.330> off<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.750> floor<00:04:15.989> and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
as I break the weight off the floor and

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.960 
as I break the weight off the floor and
that<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.680> hardest<00:04:17.100> part<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.640> deadlift

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
that is the hardest part of the deadlift

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.900 
that is the hardest part of the deadlift
that<00:04:18.209> most<00:04:18.450> forces<00:04:19.020> generated<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.370> deadlift

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
that most forces generated on a deadlift

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.430 
that most forces generated on a deadlift
during<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.359> first<00:04:21.570> inch<00:04:21.780> or<00:04:21.900> two<00:04:22.020> coming<00:04:22.260> off

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
during the first inch or two coming off

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.870 
during the first inch or two coming off
the<00:04:22.590> floor<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.039> is<00:04:23.160> where<00:04:23.310> most<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.760> your

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
the floor that is where most of your

the floor that is where most of your
force<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.210> generated<00:04:24.870> that's<00:04:25.260> well

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
force is generated that's well

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.410 
force is generated that's well
understood

type<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.640> technique<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.390> use<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.200> if<00:04:48.800> you

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
type of technique that I use and if you

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.080 
type of technique that I use and if you
want<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.190> go<00:04:49.250> back<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:49.580> look<00:04:49.730> at<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:49.910> again

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
want to go back and look at it again

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.040 
want to go back and look at it again
that<00:04:50.450> track<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.840> look<00:04:50.960> at<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.200> again<00:04:51.500> but<00:04:51.830> a

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
that track and look at it again but a

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.390 
that track and look at it again but a
properly<00:04:54.050> done<00:04:54.230> deadlift<00:04:54.770> or<00:04:54.890> where<00:04:55.010> you<00:04:55.130> use

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
properly done deadlift or where you use

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.580 
properly done deadlift or where you use
that<00:04:55.670> technique<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.750> happen<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.200> use<00:04:57.440> this

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
that technique that I happen to use this

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.640 
that technique that I happen to use this
is<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.800> very<00:04:58.190> very<00:04:59.000> common<00:04:59.540> technique<00:04:59.870> among

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
is a very very common technique among

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.670 
is a very very common technique among
competitive<00:05:01.370> power<00:05:01.520> lifters<00:05:02.500> absolutely<00:05:03.500> is

competitive power lifters absolutely is

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.030 
competitive power lifters absolutely is

argument that the deadlift done and that

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.060 
argument that the deadlift done and that
very<00:05:19.550> popular<00:05:19.910> style<00:05:20.600> is<00:05:20.930> not<00:05:21.230> using<00:05:21.950> the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
very popular style is not using the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.830 
very popular style is not using the

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
hamstring as a primary mover is just

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.350 
hamstring as a primary mover is just
ridiculous<00:05:27.710> it's<00:05:27.950> not<00:05:28.280> logical<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:29.060> doesn't

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
ridiculous it's not logical it doesn't
