00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.370 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done
things<00:04:23.130> with<00:04:23.430> his<00:04:23.550> ipad<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:24.480> we<00:04:24.630> never<00:04:25.080> could

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380

have<00:04:25.440> done<00:04:25.620> before<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.970> because

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
have done before and it's because

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.840 
have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.990> lot<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.230> new<00:04:28.590> innovation<00:04:29.250> driving

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:31.500> starts<00:04:31.890> with<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.220> new<00:04:32.400> dual-core<00:04:32.940> a5

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.600 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.810> that's<00:04:34.170> added<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.650> lot<00:04:34.860> more<00:04:34.920> speed<00:04:35.400> to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
chip that's added a lot more speed to

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
nine times faster you'll really notice

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.670 
nine times faster you'll really notice
this<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.970> games<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.660> apps<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.230> use<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.380> lot<00:04:52.500> of

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
this in games and apps that use a lot of

this in games and apps that use a lot of
video<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.250> for<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.330> first<00:04:54.510> time<00:04:54.690> we've<00:04:55.290> built

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
video and for the first time we've built

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.250 
video and for the first time we've built
a<00:04:55.620> gyro<00:04:56.070> into<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.490> iPad<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.870> gives<00:04:58.110> you

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
a gyro into this iPad that gives you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.470 
a gyro into this iPad that gives you
very<00:04:58.590> precise<00:04:59.040> control<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.880> multiple

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
very precise control in multiple

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.780 
very precise control in multiple
dimensions<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.560> allows<00:05:01.830> us<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.460> really

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
dimensions and it allows us to really

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.150 
dimensions and it allows us to really
measure<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.570> orientation<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.500> iPad<00:05:04.980> in

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
measure the orientation of the iPad in

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.940 
measure the orientation of the iPad in
space<00:05:05.750> these<00:05:06.750> new<00:05:07.020> components<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:07.770> features

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
add all kinds of possibilities when it

add all kinds of possibilities when it
comes<00:05:10.920> to<00:05:11.100> apps<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.640> even<00:05:12.480> though<00:05:12.570> we<00:05:12.750> boosted

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
comes to apps and even though we boosted

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.110 
comes to apps and even though we boosted
the<00:05:13.290> performance<00:05:13.860> we<00:05:14.130> haven't<00:05:14.580> compromised

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
the performance we haven't compromised

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
on battery life the new ipad still gets

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.180 
on battery life the new ipad still gets
a<00:05:18.090> full<00:05:18.330> 10<00:05:18.600> hours<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.230> that's<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.890> major

achievement in a design misstep with all

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.629 

the<00:05:36.490> original<00:05:37.030> iPad<00:05:37.500> defined<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.740> category<00:05:39.340> and

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.149 
the original iPad defined a category and
I<00:05:40.389> think<00:05:40.689> that<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:40.930> ipad<00:05:41.050> 2<00:05:41.590> will<00:05:41.919> really

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
I think that the ipad 2 will really

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:48.360 
I think that the ipad 2 will really
define<00:05:42.610> that<00:05:42.789> category<00:05:43.360> for<00:05:43.629> years<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:43.960> come
