00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
see it's staged so you'll actually see

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:05.730 
see it's staged so you'll actually see
the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.530 

yeah<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.920> was<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.070> staging<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:07.730> it's<00:01:08.030> that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
yeah that was the staging so it's that

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.060 
yeah that was the staging so it's that
was<00:01:08.660> probably<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.020> first<00:01:09.080> stage<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.740> second

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
was probably the first stage the second

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.140 
was probably the first stage the second
stage<00:01:10.220> you'll<00:01:10.400> see<00:01:10.550> light<00:01:10.730> up<00:01:10.850> here<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.090> a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
stage you'll see light up here in a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
stage you'll see light up here in a
second

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.350 

yeah<00:01:18.259> in<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.009> chat<00:01:20.220> room<00:01:20.399> if<00:01:20.490> people<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.850> tell

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
yeah in the chat room if people can tell

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
yeah in the chat room if people can tell
me<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.689> focused<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:22.820> my<00:01:23.820> screen

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
me if this is focused or not my screen

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
me if this is focused or not my screen
is<00:01:24.210> very<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> chat<00:01:27.840> right<00:01:28.110> there

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.330 

you<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.330> it<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:34.580> oh<00:01:35.580> is<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.660> lost<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
you get it like oh is it you lost the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
you get it like oh is it you lost the
ice<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.390> come<00:01:39.480> back<00:01:39.690> it's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
ice now it's going to come back it's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.540 
ice now it's going to come back it's
staging<00:01:40.620> again<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.190> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.370> probably

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
staging again so it's going to probably

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.450 
staging again so it's going to probably
you'll<00:01:41.790> probably<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:46.280> it's<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you'll probably see it it's going to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.350 
you'll probably see it it's going to
light<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.670> again<00:01:47.910> in<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> second<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.660> think<00:01:50.360> there

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
light up again in a second I think there

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.250 
light up again in a second I think there
it<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.540> yep

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.120 

how<00:02:00.980> far<00:02:01.250> took<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.640> kilometer<00:02:02.260> 60<00:02:03.260> kilometers

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.920 

well<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.180> actually<00:02:09.270> higher<00:02:09.570> than<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.810> thought

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
well it's actually higher than I thought

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.630 
well it's actually higher than I thought
it<00:02:09.990> was<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.260> be<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.040> can<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> smoke

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it was going to be you can see a smoke

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100 
it was going to be you can see a smoke
trail<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.300> also<00:02:12.570> it's<00:02:12.720> hard<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.080> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
trail on there also it's hard to see on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:27.890 
trail on there also it's hard to see on
the<00:02:13.260> video<00:02:13.380> but

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.270 

there<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.560> goes

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.210 

that's<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.490> cool<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:37.980> kind<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that's pretty cool you can just kind of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.590 
that's pretty cool you can just kind of
see<00:02:40.700> I'm<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.820> sure<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.150> usually<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.570> goes

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
see I'm not sure what usually it goes

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.190 
see I'm not sure what usually it goes
like<00:02:43.050> they<00:02:43.740> go<00:02:44.390> kind<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> curve<00:02:45.990> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
like they go kind of with the curve of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.200 
like they go kind of with the curve of
the<00:02:46.260> earth<00:02:46.380> there<00:02:47.210> isn't<00:02:48.210> or<00:02:48.330> bit<00:02:48.570> better<00:02:53.210> now

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
the earth there isn't or bit better now

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.130 
the earth there isn't or bit better now
it's<00:02:54.300> not<00:02:54.390> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.600> go<00:02:54.660> overhead<00:02:54.870> it's

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it's not going to go overhead it's

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.170 
it's not going to go overhead it's
streaking<00:02:55.770> up<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.610> way<00:02:58.850> they<00:02:59.850> don't<00:02:59.880> launch

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
streaking up that way they don't launch

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.550 
streaking up that way they don't launch
them<00:03:00.330> over<00:03:00.570> land<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:01.730> ya<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:04.410> like<00:03:04.500> a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
them over land for ya it's like a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:22.980 
them over land for ya it's like a
staging<00:03:04.920> again

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.630 

so<00:03:23.500> it's<00:03:23.590> probably<00:03:23.740> gonna<00:03:23.920> show<00:03:24.130> up<00:03:24.280> over

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
so it's probably gonna show up over

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.750 
so it's probably gonna show up over
there<00:03:24.970> let's<00:03:25.900> see<00:03:26.050> that's<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.680> plane<00:03:26.890> no<00:03:27.730> it's

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
there let's see that's a plane no it's

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:39.430 
there let's see that's a plane no it's
it<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.660> yeah

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.210 

that's<00:03:40.440> blinking<00:03:40.740> I<00:03:40.890> don't<00:03:41.010> think<00:03:41.130> that

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that's blinking I don't think that

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.330 
that's blinking I don't think that
that's<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.490> plane

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
that's a plane

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.280 
that's a plane
so<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.360> can<00:03:44.569> see<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.810> probably<00:03:45.140> weighed<00:03:45.260> down

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
so you can see it probably weighed down

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:54.660 
so you can see it probably weighed down
there<00:03:45.650> in<00:03:45.800> a<00:03:45.860> minute

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:03.350 

ya<00:03:55.660> miss<00:03:55.959> me<00:03:56.290> if<00:03:56.950> gone<00:03:57.220> out<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:57.640> already

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.030 

you<00:04:03.990> might<00:04:04.170> see<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.440> like<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.800> way<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
you might see it like all the way on the
