Arkham origins and I still think that's

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.580 
Arkham origins and I still think that's
possible<00:00:50.470> but<00:00:50.980> not<00:00:51.280> as<00:00:51.490> heavy<00:00:52.420> as<00:00:52.780> some<00:00:53.350> people

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
possible but not as heavy as some people

is<00:00:55.270> as<00:00:55.710> in-depth<00:00:56.710> like<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.160> don't<00:00:57.250> think<00:00:57.490> Arkham

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
is as in-depth like I don't think Arkham

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.910 
is as in-depth like I don't think Arkham
origins<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.390> based<00:00:58.630> around<00:00:58.780> or<00:00:59.050> curd<00:00:59.200> Justice

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this is before like during this

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.499

of<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.659> game<00:01:34.689> it's<00:01:35.079> like<00:01:35.200> almost<00:01:35.469> the

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
of the game it's like almost the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.950 
of the game it's like almost the
transitions<00:01:36.369> into<00:01:36.759> batman<00:01:37.450> meeting<00:01:37.869> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
it will set up an arkham for game that

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.000 
it will set up an arkham for game that
could<00:03:03.070> be<00:03:03.250> history<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.600> making<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.260> mean

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
could be history in the making I mean

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.430 
could be history in the making I mean
I'm<00:03:06.160> talking<00:03:06.550> like<00:03:06.700> having<00:03:07.330> mentioned<00:03:08.080> like

I'm talking like having mentioned like

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.470 
I'm talking like having mentioned like
you<00:03:08.740> know<00:03:08.860> how<00:03:09.040> popular<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.850> modes<00:03:10.180> how

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
you know how popular and modes how

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.030 
you know how popular and modes how
in-depth<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.230> Arkham<00:03:11.590> games<00:03:11.620> are<00:03:12.010> just

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
in-depth the Arkham games are just

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.370 
in-depth the Arkham games are just
imagine<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.330> with<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.600> Justice<00:03:14.140> League

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
imagine that but with the Justice League

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.340 
imagine that but with the Justice League
that<00:03:15.160> game<00:03:15.400> could<00:03:15.700> break<00:03:15.970> records<00:03:16.570> so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
that game could break records so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.199 
that game could break records so
obviously<00:03:18.040> they<00:03:18.190> should<00:03:18.370> hint<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.790> as<00:03:18.940> an

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
obviously they should hint it as an

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.210 
obviously they should hint it as an
easter<00:03:19.600> egg<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.140> first<00:03:20.410> arkham<00:03:20.770> game<00:03:20.980> as

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
easter egg in the first arkham game as

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.490 
easter egg in the first arkham game as
an<00:03:21.400> arkham<00:03:21.700> origins<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.900> my<00:03:23.020> guess<00:03:23.080> we'll<00:03:23.380> be

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
an arkham origins so my guess we'll be

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.230 
an arkham origins so my guess we'll be
seeing<00:03:23.530> lots<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.340> easter<00:03:24.700> eggs<00:03:24.820> for<00:03:25.209> the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
seeing lots of easter eggs for the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.699 
seeing lots of easter eggs for the
Justice<00:03:25.600> League<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:25.870> Arkham<00:03:26.110> origins<00:03:26.290> and

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
Justice League in Arkham origins and

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.370 
Justice League in Arkham origins and
then<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.520> coming<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.910> Arkham<00:03:28.240> for<00:03:28.480> or<00:03:28.750> Arkham

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
then the coming of Arkham for or Arkham

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.590 
then the coming of Arkham for or Arkham
world<00:03:29.770> will<00:03:30.310> be<00:03:30.459> seeing<00:03:30.700> justice<00:03:31.480> Lee
