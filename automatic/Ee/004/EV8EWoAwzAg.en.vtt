00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.069 
to use it for currently is blush which
is<00:00:46.710> why<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:47.460> pink<00:00:47.730> there<00:00:48.079> but

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is why it's a little bit pink there but

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
is why it's a little bit pink there but
you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.410> apply<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.950> foundation<00:00:50.610> not

the laura mercier foundation in my

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.600 
the laura mercier foundation in my
opinion<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.070> i<00:00:53.190> feel<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
opinion because i feel like it's a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
opinion because i feel like it's a
little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:53.940> too<00:00:54.120> heavy<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.079> something<00:00:55.500> maybe

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the essential foundation brush I'm not a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899

as it is but this one is tapered it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.969 
as it is but this one is tapered it's
not<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> complete<00:01:37.140> paint<00:01:37.470> brush<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:37.920> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
not like a complete paint brush when you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
not like a complete paint brush when you
compare<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.579> other<00:01:38.700> ones<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
compare it to some other ones so it

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.940 
really get that precise line or
something<00:04:45.530> it's<00:04:45.740> great<00:04:46.130> for<00:04:46.370> lips<00:04:47.710> last<00:04:48.710> but

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
something it's great for lips last but

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.440 
something it's great for lips last but
certainly<00:04:48.980> not<00:04:49.280> least<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.880> have<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.120> brow

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
certainly not least I have the brow

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.090 
certainly not least I have the brow
brush<00:04:50.720> now<00:04:51.260> at<00:04:51.350> first<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.680> thought<00:04:51.830> that<00:04:51.980> this

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
brush now at first I thought that this

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.860 
brush now at first I thought that this
would<00:04:52.250> definitely<00:04:52.430> be<00:04:52.700> too<00:04:53.030> sick<00:04:53.330> because<00:04:53.690> I

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
would definitely be too sick because I

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.060 
would definitely be too sick because I
don't<00:04:54.020> know<00:04:54.110> if<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.260> could<00:04:54.380> see<00:04:54.590> that<00:04:54.740> but

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
don't know if you could see that but

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.220 
don't know if you could see that but
their<00:04:55.940> goal<00:04:56.150> looks<00:04:56.330> like<00:04:56.480> that<00:04:56.630> thought<00:04:57.110> it

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
their goal looks like that thought it

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.070 
their goal looks like that thought it
would<00:04:57.320> be<00:04:57.410> too<00:04:57.560> thick<00:04:57.800> but<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:59.240> getting<00:04:59.840> the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
would be too thick but for getting the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.920 
would be too thick but for getting the
like<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.950> shadow<00:05:01.250> or<00:05:01.730> whatever<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.540> powder

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
like the shadow or whatever the powder

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.110 
like the shadow or whatever the powder
