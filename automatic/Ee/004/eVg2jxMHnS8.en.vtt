00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.960
 that's what a typical morning looks like for me 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:27.960
 from hey people today I'll show you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 couple of tasty fitness recipes for the morning 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.410
 for lunch and dinner 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:40.739
 and i would say a lot of fun with that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:43.890
 video at the moment i always drink in the morning 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.350
 really like a tea and just try 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.020
 I get fit because I get sent 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.230
 and I have to say they smell that way 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.510
 as good as I like the body the most 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.750
 the talks and that's why I feel that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.110
 Now in such a t Au and I think there 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.119
 looks really cool right out of me 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.830
 I'm really trying on tees at the moment 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.049
 switch because they just the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.240
 fat burning support that 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.020
 Improve skin appearance and defenses 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.020
 strengthen 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.040
 during the t1 I'm mine 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.070
 breakfast and I cut like a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.740
 few strawberries small because the included 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.400
 really many important vitamins 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.960
 then I do some yogurt brian 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.119
 Oatmeal with it all 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.770
 Both said that in the morning very much 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.850
 very good the satiety and then 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.409
 a few nuts and cranberries for the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.409
 sweet something honey 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.289
 we come for lunch and that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.489
 we need something basilic for that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.890
 avocado zucchini a garlic clove 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.700
 cashew kernels and olive oil but the heart 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.209
 or forget to show it fits 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.010
 so I cut a few zucchinis small 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.080
 add some brazil come to one 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.519
 half avocado something from the cashew kernels 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.590
 and olive oil around everything 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.970
 to connect with each other and one 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.420
 garlic clove as only substitute I take 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.090
 me a few teens and turn them over 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.560
 this vegetable sharpener i honestly 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.730
 No idea how that means 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.299
 I deserve it in the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.640
 infobox 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.470
 and that's how I get a lot from it 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:58.510
 nice spaghetti shape out then we add 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.410
 just add our pesto and then you are 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.410
 We already finished 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.110
 I have lemons for drinking 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.150
 or whatever you do that 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.250
 I just call a few lemons 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.860
 decide to cut something 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.510
 tap water added because with us 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.020
 In the region you can actually 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.590
 drink without hesitation and therefore not 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.420
 I'm still a little bit stevia 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.420
 stirred in the water 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.610
 and if you really like it too 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.650
 take pictures of your healthy food or 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.870
 generally very Fittes are oriented 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.660
 then i have an app tip for you here 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.340
 and I have the pop up app 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.370
 really seen very often 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.400
 There you will find a very large fitness 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.020
 motivated community and it goes in the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.150
 app actually only around the topic 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.210
 fitness works much the same way 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.210
 on instagram you can see photos of licon and 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.230
 Of course, even post photos like 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.340
 I now for example and then leave 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.340
 I like it 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.660
 we come to dinner and do it 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.640
 I have the very popular quinoa salad and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.430
 i do it my way 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.810
 First of all, I cook the quinoa and 4g 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.220
 add some vegetable stock to the water 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.100
 Just to make it a little more flavorful 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.200
 because as you may know quinoa 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.940
 Tastes really nothing but there 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.770
 we can really get a lot of protein 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.730
 he is very good for that 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:51.450
 Muscle and, of course, ideal for 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:53.190
 or after training in my quinoa 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.020
 salad I'll do a few more then 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.670
 tomato pure paprika avocado feta cheese 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.700
 it's a bit salad but you know it 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.640
 is actually make real all purely 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.680
 Also very good in kiel salad or cucumbers 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.090
 and so on, so there you can really 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.980
 make everything pure when the cinema 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.810
 you can cool the course 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.400
 already add to the salad 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.320
 and then we come too 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.060
 dressing and indeed it is really one 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.370
 very simple dressing so nothing 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.790
 complicated and just something 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:32.040
 lemon and a pinch of salt and pepper 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.419
 and that 's it so I hope you have that 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.090
 you like the video and you might do it 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.830
