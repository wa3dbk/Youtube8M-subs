00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
and electric power engine in it as well

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.130 
and electric power engine in it as well
and<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:25.090> gas<00:01:26.090> engine<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.659> about<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.899> hundred

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
and the gas engine is about a hundred

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.330 
and the gas engine is about a hundred
and<00:01:28.270> sixty-five<00:01:29.270> horsepower<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.500> the

and sixty-five horsepower and the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.789 
and sixty-five horsepower and the
electric<00:01:31.759> engine<00:01:31.939> is<00:01:32.240> about<00:01:32.390> forty<00:01:33.170> five

electric engine is about forty five

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.620 
electric engine is about forty five
horsepower<00:01:34.460> or<00:01:34.789> something<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:35.569> you

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
horsepower or something like that so you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.179 
horsepower or something like that so you
can<00:01:35.689> see<00:01:35.929> that<00:01:36.110> it's<00:01:36.259> still<00:01:36.470> heavily<00:01:36.979> weighted

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
can see that it's still heavily weighted

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.800 
can see that it's still heavily weighted
towards<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.479> gas<00:01:38.720> powered<00:01:39.170> engine<00:01:39.759> but<00:01:40.810> from

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
towards the gas powered engine but from

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.010 
towards the gas powered engine but from
what<00:01:41.929> I<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:42.079> tell<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:44.299> electrical<00:01:44.780> part

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
what I can tell the the electrical part

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.539 
what I can tell the the electrical part
of<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:45.380> actually<00:01:45.770> pretty<00:01:46.009> powerful<00:01:46.189> I<00:01:46.520> mean

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
of it is actually pretty powerful I mean

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.690 
of it is actually pretty powerful I mean
a<00:01:46.700> 40<00:01:47.149> horsepower<00:01:47.479> electrical<00:01:48.349> engine<00:01:48.709> is

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
a 40 horsepower electrical engine is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.050 
a 40 horsepower electrical engine is
nothing<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.209> see<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:51.759> think<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:52.880> we're

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
nothing to see that I think that we're

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.050 
nothing to see that I think that we're
the<00:01:53.330> challenge<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.470> car<00:01:54.709> still<00:01:54.979> has<00:01:55.159> is

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
the challenge that this car still has is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.109 
the challenge that this car still has is
the<00:01:56.720> fact<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.140> there's<00:01:57.880> fairly<00:01:58.880> limited

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
the fact that there's fairly limited

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.139 
the fact that there's fairly limited
battery<00:01:59.599> capacity<00:02:00.369> that's<00:02:01.369> in<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.670> vehicle

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
battery capacity that's in this vehicle

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.370 
battery capacity that's in this vehicle
it's<00:02:02.270> about<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.569> it's<00:02:02.750> got<00:02:02.929> about<00:02:03.049> a<00:02:03.170> hundred

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
it's about it it's got about a hundred

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
that that presents is is that you are

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.510 
that that presents is is that you are
really<00:02:18.340> limited<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> amount<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:20.520> capacity

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
really limited in the amount of capacity

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.510 
really limited in the amount of capacity
that<00:02:21.700> your<00:02:21.880> trunk<00:02:22.209> out<00:02:22.390> because<00:02:22.959> your<00:02:23.110> truck

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that your trunk out because your truck

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.070 
that your trunk out because your truck
it's<00:02:24.520> taken<00:02:24.910> up<00:02:25.030> probably<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.599> third<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.020> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
it's taken up probably a third of the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.440 
it's taken up probably a third of the
trunk<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.440> taken<00:02:26.770> up<00:02:26.890> with<00:02:27.060> 150<00:02:28.060> pounds<00:02:28.360> of

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
trunk is taken up with 150 pounds of

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.809 
trunk is taken up with 150 pounds of
batteries<00:02:28.599> so<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.590> really<00:02:30.459> don't<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.760> much

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
batteries so you really don't have much

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.750 
batteries so you really don't have much
total<00:02:31.390> capacity<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.170> car<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:33.040> I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
total capacity in this car but I I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.940 
total capacity in this car but I I
really<00:02:34.269> wish<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.620> battery

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
really wish that the the battery

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.800 
really wish that the the battery
capacity<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.970> car<00:02:37.209> was<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> lot<00:02:37.750> more<00:02:38.670> so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
capacity in this car was a lot more so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.150 
capacity in this car was a lot more so
you<00:02:40.810> know<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.140> car<00:02:41.380> could<00:02:41.620> spend<00:02:41.890> more<00:02:42.099> time

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
you know this car could spend more time

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.150 
you know this car could spend more time
driving<00:02:42.640> off<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.090> electric<00:02:43.630> engine<00:02:44.100> or<00:02:45.100> motor

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
driving off the electric engine or motor

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.030 
driving off the electric engine or motor
I<00:02:45.549> should<00:02:45.850> say<00:02:46.049> than<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.200> does<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.739> actually

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
I should say than it does it actually

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.550 
I should say than it does it actually
spends<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.720> part<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.110> reason<00:02:50.380> why<00:02:50.500> it

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
spends and part of the reason why it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.500 
spends and part of the reason why it
doesn't<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:51.459> good<00:02:51.489> at<00:02:51.850> gas<00:02:52.000> mileage<00:02:52.360> as

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
doesn't get as good at gas mileage as

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.030 
doesn't get as good at gas mileage as
you<00:02:52.660> would<00:02:52.810> expect<00:02:53.230> from<00:02:53.440> probably<00:02:53.920> an

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
you would expect from probably an

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.539 
you would expect from probably an
electric<00:02:54.400> car<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.930> mainly<00:02:56.799> runs<00:02:57.280> off<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
electric car is it mainly runs off the

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.180 
electric car is it mainly runs off the
electric<00:02:58.150> are<00:02:58.420> off<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.900> gas<00:02:59.080> engine

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
electric are off of the gas engine

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.040 
electric are off of the gas engine
if<00:03:01.490> there<00:03:01.730> was<00:03:01.850> more<00:03:02.030> capacity<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.750> that

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
if there was more capacity in that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.870 
if there was more capacity in that
battery<00:03:03.610> or<00:03:04.610> juice<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.750> was<00:03:05.870> available<00:03:06.880> and

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
battery or juice that was available and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.120 
battery or juice that was available and
I<00:03:07.940> think<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.570> car<00:03:08.840> could<00:03:09.080> get<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.890> lot

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
I think that this car could get a lot

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.520 
I think that this car could get a lot
higher<00:03:10.370> gas<00:03:10.640> mileage<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.120> think<00:03:11.450> we<00:03:11.570> could<00:03:11.750> get

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
higher gas mileage I think we could get

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.740 
higher gas mileage I think we could get
up<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:13.310> know<00:03:13.340> maybe<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.120> hundred<00:03:14.210> miles<00:03:14.540> per

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
up to you know maybe a hundred miles per

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.810 
up to you know maybe a hundred miles per
gallon<00:03:15.080> something<00:03:15.470> like<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.860> if<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.640> could

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
gallon something like that if I could

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.430 
gallon something like that if I could
drive<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.150> vehicle<00:03:17.330> more<00:03:17.750> without<00:03:18.260> having

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
drive this vehicle more without having

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.930 
drive this vehicle more without having
to<00:03:18.860> actually<00:03:19.430> use<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:20.690> gas<00:03:20.870> engine<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:21.440> much

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
to actually use the gas engine so much

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.120 
to actually use the gas engine so much
so<00:03:22.940> anyway<00:03:23.180> that's<00:03:23.330> kind<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.990> a<00:03:24.110> high<00:03:25.100> level

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
so anyway that's kind of a high level

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.300 
so anyway that's kind of a high level
view<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.730> kind<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.780> my<00:03:26.930> experience<00:03:27.890> with<00:03:27.920> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
view of kind of my experience with the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.640 
view of kind of my experience with the
camry<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.930> wanted<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.320> create<00:03:30.560> a

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
camry and just wanted to create a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.320 
camry and just wanted to create a
another<00:03:31.340> video<00:03:31.670> kind<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.030> giving<00:03:32.240> a<00:03:32.300> little

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
another video kind of giving a little

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.380 
another video kind of giving a little
bit<00:03:32.660> different<00:03:33.020> perspective<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:34.400> know

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
bit different perspective on it I know

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.210 
bit different perspective on it I know
that<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.750> video<00:03:35.870> on<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.470> part<00:03:36.740> of<00:03:36.800> it<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:37.040> not

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
that the video on this part of it is not

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.780 
that the video on this part of it is not
necessarily<00:03:37.640> quite<00:03:38.060> as<00:03:38.240> as<00:03:38.710> as<00:03:39.710> engaging<00:03:40.370> with

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
necessarily quite as as as engaging with

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.660 
necessarily quite as as as engaging with
the<00:03:40.970> vehicle<00:03:41.360> itself<00:03:41.690> but<00:03:41.960> it<00:03:42.080> also<00:03:42.490> helps<00:03:43.490> you

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
the vehicle itself but it also helps you

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.510 
the vehicle itself but it also helps you
see<00:03:43.940> me<00:03:44.840> driving<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.710> what<00:03:46.490> that

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
see me driving it and what that

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.580 
see me driving it and what that
experience<00:03:46.940> might<00:03:47.300> be<00:03:47.330> like<00:03:47.630> I'm<00:03:47.810> not<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:48.170> can't

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
experience might be like I'm not I can't

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.840 
experience might be like I'm not I can't
believe<00:03:49.010> what<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.250> adventure<00:03:49.610> that<00:03:49.730> you're

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
believe what the adventure that you're

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.180 
believe what the adventure that you're
looking<00:03:50.180> at<00:03:50.300> is<00:03:50.510> because<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.530> camera<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.040> on

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
looking at is because the camera is on

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.670 
looking at is because the camera is on
my<00:03:52.310> dashboard<00:03:52.520> but<00:03:53.120> but<00:03:53.690> anyway<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.200> certainly

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
my dashboard but but anyway I certainly

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.420 
my dashboard but but anyway I certainly
appreciate<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.630> watching<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.930> video<00:03:57.430> and

appreciate you watching the video and
I'll<00:03:58.940> probably<00:03:59.390> come<00:03:59.660> up<00:03:59.810> with<00:03:59.990> a<00:04:00.020> few<00:04:00.410> more

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
I'll probably come up with a few more

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.770 
I'll probably come up with a few more
videos<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.760> this<00:04:01.850> car<00:04:02.120> or<00:04:02.240> I'll<00:04:02.330> probably<00:04:02.540> give

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
videos of this car or I'll probably give

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.310 
videos of this car or I'll probably give
an<00:04:02.960> external<00:04:03.860> tour<00:04:04.100> next<00:04:04.850> actually<00:04:05.630> shows<00:04:06.050> the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
an external tour next actually shows the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.270 
an external tour next actually shows the
engine

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
engine

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.650 
engine
trunk<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:07.790> all<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.000> kind<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.240> stuff<00:04:08.360> might

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
trunk and all that kind of stuff might

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.050 
trunk and all that kind of stuff might
be<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.930> next<00:04:09.250> video<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.520> I<00:04:10.610> put<00:04:10.970> together

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
be the next video that I put together

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.080 
be the next video that I put together
for<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.630> too<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.200> thanks<00:04:12.950> for<00:04:13.069> watching<00:04:13.130> bye
