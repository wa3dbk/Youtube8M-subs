it's<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.070> pretty<00:02:18.280> color<00:02:18.370> i<00:02:18.580> haven't

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
it's a really pretty color i haven't

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.150 
it's a really pretty color i haven't
worn<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.240> yet<00:02:19.270> but<00:02:19.660> i<00:02:19.870> really<00:02:20.710> like<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.010> there's

almost<00:02:21.310> like<00:02:21.520> yellow<00:02:22.030> shimmer<00:02:22.330> in<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.600> as<00:02:22.840> well

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
almost like yellow shimmer in it as well

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.570 
almost like yellow shimmer in it as well
I<00:02:23.080> just<00:02:23.260> thought<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.590> was<00:02:23.650> really<00:02:23.710> pretty<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
I just thought it was really pretty the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.940 
I just thought it was really pretty the
next<00:02:24.940> 1<00:02:25.090> i've<00:02:25.300> got<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:25.780> called<00:02:26.320> butterscotch

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
next 1 i've got is called butterscotch

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.560 
next 1 i've got is called butterscotch
and<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.490> isn't<00:02:27.850> really<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.060> color<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
and this isn't really a color that I

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.510 
and this isn't really a color that I
would<00:02:28.720> go<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.410> usually<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:30.250> sort<00:02:30.490> of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
would go for it usually like sort of

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.460 
would go for it usually like sort of
briny<00:02:30.970> nudes<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.720> i<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.140> thought<00:02:32.260> i<00:02:32.440> would

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
briny nudes but i just thought i would
