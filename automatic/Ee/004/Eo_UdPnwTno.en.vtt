00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.710
 hello everyone welcome so I do not vitoria 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.580
 a if it is a master 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.269
 in the video that we're going 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.819
 To make 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.819
 let's try to explain there was by the end 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:15.789
 on that occasion 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.789
 we already saw that he played the four horses 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.320
 new video we will learn in little of the mouse arrives 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.230
 to play the attack the couple looks for the way chess and five pawns 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 four control pins i 1 of the opposite side 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 to begin then this important one we set that the pawns have been all 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 in the same color as the houses 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.370
 the mouse will be this the first kilometer 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.510
 and the batos will be these four blasco pawns 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.520
 whats the game about 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.940
 bush the ducks keep that in ferrol the mouse 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.200
 and leave it motionless 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.459
 the moment of 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.840
 the saints and the mouse always does it diagonally 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.690
 ask for a box in a box 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.010
 the data just go forward and the mouse cures the cancer before and to 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.470
 behind 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.530
 this position could be emitted in which they can be trapped 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.760
 the magnate ducks in which he will try to close the criminal 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.780
 piscu with the pawn 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.850
 power for alante 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.350
 we can approach cats because there is no problem in approaching them 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.370
 they can not capture us 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 here they came to the ducks when they beat the peo 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.400
 example we make is 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 and as for the reason for example I know what we do is 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.360
 the mouse come back here 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.690
 is discounted 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.220
 the mouse something solid after passing the barrier of the ducks 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.490
 and that can not be captured alive 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.870
 Thus 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.350
 here I had won the mouse 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 our position we are previously 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.090
 little by little banks bradesco and locking up the platoon 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.530
 and it is that little by little 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 Arafat honored box for doing it quickly 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.290
 the tambo 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.049
 that finally when they gained factor is in this position where 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.049
 the mouse you do not have any 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.499
 while there was quite fun that its robust 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.199
 not only are you thinking and the mouse 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:40.189
 with these quite simple to play you learn in Seville and that for sure 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.529
 that exists 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.299
 type of problems 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.089
 those games this this game 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.609
 alternative to chess 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.009
 a web tool so that these students do not just practice chess with 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.059
 the nuclear parts 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.159
 that we can sneak another kind of games what 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.429
 this 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.419
 that our students do not get bored 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.099
 those that are not fun 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.789
 and that little by little we go 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.079
 learning not the options that chess gives us 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.239
 here the students to walk 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.559
 have fun to have to think uncomfortable in the bank 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.099
 or as 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.859
 escape the time 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.029
 how to get 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.809
 in all the bad work they coordinate to close a while 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.979
 and the matelec mouse tries to escape from the saints 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.469
 It's fun but our students will also strive 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.489
 to get castro to the mouse 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.409
 get out of the four quarters 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.239
 I hope you love beautiful classes 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.889
 club is fun 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.889
 and you will see 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:46.909
