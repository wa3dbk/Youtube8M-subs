00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 And there you have news people and today I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.250
 to doubt many people 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.690
 does it always leave the smartphone 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.690
 vice carrying the same battery 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.390
 well that old story still begets 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.130
 doubt in the minds of many people 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.750
 will be even if you interrupted a letter does 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.489
 wrong battery and put your 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.320
 device to charge battery students 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.609
 end will also hurt then it is 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.230
 That's what I'm going to explain today. 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.270
 batteries that are now used in 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.949
 smartphones and other electronics are the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.900
 lithium wines also known as 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.089
 lyon iphone you have no way to remove 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.769
 his battery but the devices that give 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.079
 for you to remove the battery probably 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.820
 will have a label and there it should say 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.260
 kind of battery that this is what I 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.150
 ask what type of battery the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.010
 Apple uses for its animals not 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.109
 worry that also the ion battery 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.489
 the ion batteries do not keep 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.559
 known as memory of 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.570
 loading in other words they do not 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.430
 so there is no need to 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.199
 give a charge of more than 24 hours in the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.239
 first time we'll load there like 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.710
 was for example old cell phones and not 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.420
 we should not even expect 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.310
 smartphones fell flat to 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.229
 load and in the same way 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.030
 there is no danger of leaving barely used 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.950
 if you pull out of the outlet before 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.810
 time though folks this does not mean 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.160
 that the batteries remain as new 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.869
 after some time of use 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.520
 in most cases the linen battery 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.560
 years has an estimated useful life of approximately 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.240
 three years since they are losing 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.740
 their capacity over time 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.450
 with this we have the impression that our 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.890
 devices are no longer the same 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.320
 So go ahead and stop that. 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.420
 smartphone battery is myth to console if 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.460
 popularized circulated information from 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.990
 that the batteries were addictive if you 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.119
 carry seats finish house 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.890
 prior to the following would last less time 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.720
 and so on the first wages 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.340
 had nickel batteries that 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.829
 require the load to be emptied by 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.930
 complete before recharging 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.969
 otherwise they were affected by 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.950
 memory effect but like I said guys 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.630
 this is only on devices that have 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.250
 then nickel batteries do not 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.899
 worry next time to remove your 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.729
 idevice of the outlet while it is 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.789
 carrying the place for him to carry 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.409
 for example 50% or 60% battery because 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.909
 That folks, it does not hurt 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.560
 the people who liked the like video 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.329
 who is not enrolled in the click channel

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.010
 much but very much the disclosure here 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.290
 channel and of course if you have that 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 friend who thinks he's addicted to battery 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.410
 Send this video to him for at least 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.880
 so he does not worry about the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.320
 device may corrupt 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.010
 I wish you all a great weekend 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.939
