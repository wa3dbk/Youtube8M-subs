00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
limited to certain functions we can take

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.600 
limited to certain functions we can take
him<00:01:43.350> literally<00:01:44.100> anywhere<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:45.890> think<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.369> chair

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
him literally anywhere I think the chair

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
him literally anywhere I think the chair
topper<00:01:47.939> has<00:01:48.030> changed<00:01:48.479> his<00:01:48.630> life<00:01:48.979> obviously

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
topper has changed his life obviously

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340

the<00:01:50.100> stroke<00:01:50.399> changed<00:01:51.390> his<00:01:51.570> life<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> major

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the stroke changed his life in a major

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.830 
the stroke changed his life in a major
way<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.420> given<00:01:54.719> him

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
way but I think it's given him

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.859 
way but I think it's given him
confidence<00:01:55.289> to<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.399> about<00:01:56.969> he's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
confidence to go out and about he's
