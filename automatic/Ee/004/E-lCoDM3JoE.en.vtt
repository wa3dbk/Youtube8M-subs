thought I'd do today is show you how the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.439 
thought I'd do today is show you how the
wide<00:00:25.710> tail<00:00:25.949> actually<00:00:26.189> works<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:27.000> back

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
wide tail actually works it's like back

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.910 
wide tail actually works it's like back
to<00:00:27.630> basics<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> lot<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.470> people<00:00:28.769> don't

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
to basics because a lot of people don't

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.380 
to basics because a lot of people don't
realize<00:00:29.359> how<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.689> works<00:00:32.329> there's<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
realize how it actually works there's a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.770 
realize how it actually works there's a
few<00:00:33.570> different<00:00:33.930> models<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.219> new<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.780> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
few different models now the new one and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240 
few different models now the new one and
if<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.200> back<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> bit<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> one

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
if you go back a bit you get the one

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.119 
if you go back a bit you get the one
with<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> yellow<00:00:38.610> disc<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.129> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
with the yellow disc on it and the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.369 
with the yellow disc on it and the
intermediate<00:00:41.640> one<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> blue

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
intermediate one is the one with a blue

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.900 
intermediate one is the one with a blue
disc<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.329> work<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.840> well

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
disc on it but they all work really well

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
disc on it but they all work really well
now<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> yellow<00:00:48.840> disc<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
now the one with the yellow disc on is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
now the one with the yellow disc on is
best<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.309> modifying<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> moment<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
best for modifying at the moment and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
best for modifying at the moment and
they<00:00:52.469> come<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> couple<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.460> clips<00:00:53.789> which

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
they come with a couple of clips which

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.549 
they come with a couple of clips which
go<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:57.480> come<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:57.989> closer<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.410> can

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
go on you come in a bit closer you can

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.899 
go on you come in a bit closer you can
see<00:01:01.190> they<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.219> attach<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:04.700> you<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
see they just attach like this you just

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.310 
see they just attach like this you just
slide<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.510> onto<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> pad<00:01:08.600> then<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.990> clips

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
slide it onto the pad then it just clips

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.609 
slide it onto the pad then it just clips
on<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> actual<00:01:11.520> wagtail<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
on to the actual wagtail like that it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
on to the actual wagtail like that it
works<00:01:13.770> pretty<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.990> ok<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:17.670> I'll<00:01:17.820> show

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
works pretty well ok and what I'll show

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
works pretty well ok and what I'll show
you<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> actually<00:01:19.470> works<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you now is how it actually works on the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
you now is how it actually works on the
glass<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:23.420> usually<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.049> shocks

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
glass I usually use this one I'm shocks

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.179 
glass I usually use this one I'm shocks
and<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> smaller<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and that and the smaller one for the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.370 
and that and the smaller one for the
actual<00:01:29.450> domestic<00:01:30.450> I'll<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.780> coming<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
actual domestic I'll be coming to in a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
actual domestic I'll be coming to in a
minute<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.340> come<00:01:32.579> over<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.939> we'll<00:01:33.180> show

minute if you come over here we'll show
you<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> actually<00:01:34.020> works

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
you how it actually works

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
you how it actually works
as<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> pad<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.350> sort<00:01:37.950> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
as you can see that pad just sort of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.130 
as you can see that pad just sort of
falls<00:01:38.340> down

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
falls down

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.920 
falls down
that's<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.350> washing<00:01:40.710> pad<00:01:41.030> right<00:01:42.030> now<00:01:42.780> when

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that's the washing pad right now when

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.420 
that's the washing pad right now when
you<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> window<00:01:43.799> wet<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.960> okay

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
you want to do a window wet it up okay

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
you want to do a window wet it up okay
turn<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> upside<00:01:47.700> down<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
turn it upside down like that so the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.840 
turn it upside down like that so the
pads<00:01:49.229> falling<00:01:49.770> down<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.520> falling

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
pads falling down you see that's falling

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179 
pads falling down you see that's falling
down<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.439> now<00:01:52.439> I'll<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.159> in

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
down like that now I'll do this all in

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.950 
down like that now I'll do this all in
slow<00:01:53.430> time<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.299> what's<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.810> on

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
slow time so you can see what's going on

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.039 
slow time so you can see what's going on
it's<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.369> washing<00:01:56.880> wipe<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.840> some

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it's not a washing wipe in one as some

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
it's not a washing wipe in one as some
people<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.340> still<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.820> wash<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
people think you still have to wash the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
people think you still have to wash the
window<00:02:00.509> first<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.530> flip<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> pad<00:02:02.159> back

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
window first and then flip the pad back

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.410 
window first and then flip the pad back
first<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:04.740> tip<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.040> upside<00:02:05.189> down

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
first of all just tip it upside down

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.970 
first of all just tip it upside down

that then you can either just let the
pad<00:02:16.600> flip<00:02:17.020> down<00:02:17.260> again<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:18.640> when<00:02:18.790> you're<00:02:18.940> going

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
