00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.319
 hi here is techno with a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.599
 small display comparison of six 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 different smartphones with at least 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.719
 two different display technologies 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.699
 I 've got the hot game 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.769
 lightning started as you can see and 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 thought this is nice and colorful 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.460
 you have the colors a bit 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.019
 compare 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.019
 sometimes a reason for this direct 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.380
 comparison was my current still 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.239
 ricoh darkside running tests 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.680
 this giant 57 inch here at the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.540
 the colors are especially gaudy 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.370
 come over and that nice and bright 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 lit as you can see here I have 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.530
 all six displays to maximum 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
 brightness is set and maybe it goes 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.260
 Just go through the series 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.550
 which devices have this over here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 is like kodak time i already had 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.030
 we'll do the im here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 clockwise continue and again that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.940
 htc one with its 4.7 inches full hd 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.470
 Display that 's just the HD display 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.320
 left here and took the htc aegon with 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.890
 an amoled display qhd left here the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 lgl 72 with the bvg a display thus 480 x 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.400
 800 points only dissolve the lowest 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.180
 display here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.479
 up here have that ricoh cx2 with 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.119
 hd-display 45 69 points 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.500
 and last but not least, right above 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.930
 on the 24th 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.509
 also in cuba d display but in 52 format 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.829
 That's 4.5 inches around 0 4 3 inches too 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.770
 4.3 lb is coming from the lg 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.970
 Housing slightly more compact yet built 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.280
 yes, but actually wanted the less 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.320
 speak on the size than on the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.170
 or look that was here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:00.360
 everything in the same condition is neither 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.979
 less the wrestler in about this little 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.869
 intro sequence and we should go on now 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.939
 all six screens the same 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.890
 auto rotate see as I said all 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.390
 Six screens are at the maximum 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.160
 brightness is adjusted you can see faith 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.310
 I quite clear that it's like kodak 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.730
 Time 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.540
 the brightest in comparison 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.360
 I also find that surprising that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.550
 amoled displays display on the oled he 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.739
 usually not in the book like that 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.209
 to be bright too with the dealers 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.239
 counts if I compare so here times 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.810
 by eye without measuring technology 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.670
 to have 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.090
 is it about as bright as the asus 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.580
 abus a 24 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.060
 the two a little darker and below 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.319
 the htc was amazingly that 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.780
 darkest of all 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.910
 I would like to briefly 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.549
 Check if that's really correct 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.410
 is calling for the setting times 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:03.080
 The first day could see here 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:06.530
 not somehow something wrong he tells 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.280
 lie is not so easy to take 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.280
 to find the points 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:21.650
 but somewhere display display 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.450
 there it is brightness automatic 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.390
 due date is also the absolute 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.030
 Lowered has never been so 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.100
 been clear or become that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.220
 that's pretty dark 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.940
 is otherwise very nice display though 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:43.310
 keeps relatively dark darker than dark 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.910
 everyone else here in the comparison yes 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.299
 I think the colors are one, too 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.840
 to recognize certain differences that 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.579
 nico does not just work a bit 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.420
 brighter so radiate but also the blue 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.720
 above all things is very bright blue 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.760
 Interestingly, the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.590
 shades of gray only here after 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.840
 They go for a bit of purple , for example 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.840
 are really less here 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.739
 strained that gets less dark and 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.739
 exciting in the button 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.139
 otherwise, of course, by the 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.490
 brightness a bit irritating 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.580
 calm times the brightness of the devices in 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.599
 be strong about the same values 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:36.080
 times down to kick it as I can 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.610
 turn the dax has this by the way 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.710
 has pretty inappropriate names 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.780
 darksiders dark display is not right 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.460
 at well below half almost 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.720
 already a third on this scale here 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.220
 down and let's see if we are now in 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.750
 about the same level come the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.759
 previous try it still 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.530
 a piece of lighter 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.759
 now I think that's about the same 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.130
 there will still be a tick for that 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.900
 brighter the other is yet 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.720
 comparable to the house a 24 to 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.729
 example okay then maybe you can 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.150
 The colors are a bit more accurate 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.070
 still look that Alsace 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.139
 and light red stitch here has the blue 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.050
 something nina advertises the amoled display goes 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.300
 in a similar direction 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.800
 altogether a bit warmer colors here 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:28.099
 I would say the while 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.990
 the wiko is a bit cooler, yes 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.310
 that's why somehow so 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.479
 all the others have in the comparison 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.289
 becomes a bit like that 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.060
 rotstich speaks there maybe that 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.560
 red then a bit weaker here in the 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.449
 background that surfboards looks now 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.060
 not necessarily a bit darker 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.110
 may already have maybe 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:52.789
 a slightly cooler tuned 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.680
 display so far from here for the first time 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.900
 is a small balance 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.490
 ultimately also for the test of ricoh 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.479
 dark side I wanted that still fast 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.050
 before I do the 62 of the same 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.820
 manufacturer now has to send back 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.490
 and the opportunity is used by everyone 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.830
 devices just fly around side by side 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.270
 to lay down and to try this out 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.389
 if you like this kind of test 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.530
 says let me know then 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.669
 Maybe I'll check it again 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.289
 often a few devices next to each other 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.400
 put and maybe other aspects 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.900
 can try 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.339
 one point you should maybe still 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.249
 just try it out how it works with the 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.679
 perspective from 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.799
 Unity looks like it will be a bit 

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:33.599
 moved here I think in this 

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:37.999
 direction is already clear that they are at 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:41.129
 all equipment quite well from the 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:47.099
 commented swarm will then somehow 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:49.679
 the brightest of her seen the others 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:56.159
 Fade a little bit once in 

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:57.719
 that's the way to go again 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.939
 was something that is the least dependent 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:04.999
 but also here the micro place because very 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.999
 nice and bright here 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:14.069
 that will be a bit dependent on that 

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:17.969
 I also feel really dizzy 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:19.939
 Everyone can hear their own 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.199
 still pulling the key 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:25.049
 Overall, I'm really surprised 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:29.129
 how dark compared to the others 

00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:30.749
 when will the display of the htc be 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:33.119
 otherwise really a great one 

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:35.759
 display is printed and looks like 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:37.529
 of course with a high full hd 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:40.199
 Resolution on the relatively small format 

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.329
 47 inches an unbelievable pixel density 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:45.269
 There is definitely no points 

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:46.559
 I see more of the difference 

00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:47.939
 you can see the movement most likely only 

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:49.849
 maybe a bit more liquid maybe 

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:53.069
 act as now on a hd display 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:54.169
 and different calls are so far 

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:57.179
 from here 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.469
 i am something of techno a lot and year 

00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:01.349
 if you liked that, too 

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:04.169
 have experienced the channel or do not let 

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:08.389
 if he knows such videos in one 

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:08.389
 majority would have like to order
