and not be afraid and once you're ready

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.149 
and not be afraid and once you're ready
just<00:01:05.489> make<00:01:05.760> sure<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.000> feet<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.180> wide<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
just make sure your feet are wide and

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.080 
just make sure your feet are wide and
you<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.549> sure<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.939> all<00:01:09.060> your

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you want to make sure that all your

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.929 
you want to make sure that all your
weight<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:10.560> into<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.340> transition

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
weight is going into the transition

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.330 
weight is going into the transition
because<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.380> scared<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:14.220> going

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
because if you get scared you're going

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.469 
because if you get scared you're going
to<00:01:14.400> fall<00:01:14.610> backwards<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.119> you'll<00:01:15.299> hit<00:01:15.420> your

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to fall backwards and you'll hit your

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
to fall backwards and you'll hit your
hip<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> that's<00:01:19.680> probably<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> most<00:01:20.310> common

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
hip so that's probably the most common

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
hip so that's probably the most common
mistake<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.270> people<00:01:21.509> getting<00:01:22.080> scared<00:01:22.380> last

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
mistake is people getting scared last
