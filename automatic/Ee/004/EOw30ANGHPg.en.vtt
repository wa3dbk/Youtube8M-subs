Dragon Knight but I think it will be

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.430 
Dragon Knight but I think it will be
common<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.000> see<00:03:39.239> draconian<00:03:39.630> power<00:03:39.930> taken<00:03:40.350> as

focus on either the other two depending

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.009 
focus on either the other two depending
on<00:03:44.400> if<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.609> player<00:03:44.819> wants<00:03:45.090> damage<00:03:45.420> or<00:03:45.600> support

either way the Dragon Knight will be a
