in<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.640> case<00:00:47.850> we've<00:00:48.090> got<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.360> different

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
in this case we've got the different

in this case we've got the different
layers<00:00:48.780> interweaving<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.829> working<00:00:50.100> together

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to go after one function which is fit so

under the shoe you look at the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
under the shoe you look at the
cushioning<00:01:04.470> setup<00:01:04.799> we've<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> max<00:01:06.060> volume

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
cushioning setup we've got a max volume

zoom<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.200> heel<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> forefoot

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
zoom in the heel and we got a forefoot

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.570 
zoom in the heel and we got a forefoot
zoom<00:01:09.510> underneath<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.320> pot<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.680> well<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.460> what

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
zoom underneath this pot as well so what

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
zoom underneath this pot as well so what
the<00:01:11.640> pod<00:01:11.820> does<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.540> allows<00:01:12.689> us<00:01:12.930> actually<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the pod does is it allows us actually to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
the pod does is it allows us actually to
raise<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.189> zoom<00:01:14.369> bag<00:01:14.610> off<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.180> surface<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
raise that zoom bag off the surface of

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.840 
raise that zoom bag off the surface of
the<00:01:15.750> foot<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.229> you're<00:01:17.040> engaging<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> zoom

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the foot so you're engaging that zoom

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.580 
the foot so you're engaging that zoom
bag<00:01:18.060> before<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.810> engage<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> rest<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
bag before you engage the rest of the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
bag before you engage the rest of the
shoe<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> cushioning<00:01:20.790> almost<00:01:21.119> works<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
shoe so the cushioning almost works as a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.620 
shoe so the cushioning almost works as a
functional<00:01:22.560> mechanical<00:01:23.189> piston<00:01:23.700> system<00:01:23.939> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
functional mechanical piston system so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.969 
functional mechanical piston system so
you're<00:01:24.750> getting<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> cushioning<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
you're getting that cushioning for the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.469 
you're getting that cushioning for the
impact<00:01:26.280> protection<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.909> you're<00:01:27.360> getting

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
impact protection and you're getting

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
impact protection and you're getting
that<00:01:27.689> responsiveness<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.619> only<00:01:28.770> Superman

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that responsiveness that only Superman

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
that responsiveness that only Superman
can<00:01:29.310> provide<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> Jordan<00:01:30.840> Miller

see come into play from the watch it's

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.460 
see come into play from the watch it's
actually<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.970> way<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.479> pieces<00:01:36.720> interweave

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
actually the way these pieces interweave

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.840 
actually the way these pieces interweave
so<00:01:37.920> you've<00:01:38.070> got<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> fly<00:01:38.430> wire<00:01:38.610> piece

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
so you've got the fly wire piece

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.450 
so you've got the fly wire piece
interweaving<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.720> quarter<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.979> our

watches with the interlacing pieces in

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.420 
watches with the interlacing pieces in
the<00:01:45.270> watch<00:01:45.390> face<00:01:45.659> you've<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.070> TPU

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the watch face you've got the TPU

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.030 
the watch face you've got the TPU
support<00:01:48.119> cage<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.350> outside<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.890> that

full-length inner beauty that you can
see<00:01:55.079> coming<00:01:55.530> through<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.710> windows<00:01:56.009> right

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
see coming through the windows right

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.200 
see coming through the windows right
there<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> wrapping<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.909> around<00:01:57.090> the

there and wrapping up around the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
there and wrapping up around the
Achilles<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> watch<00:01:58.740> comes<00:01:59.009> into

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
Achilles and then the watch comes into

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.010 
Achilles and then the watch comes into
play<00:01:59.310> again<00:01:59.430> around<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> heel<00:02:00.180> where<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.869> see

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
play again around the heel where you see

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539

the jump man in each one of the tick

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.289 
the jump man in each one of the tick
marks<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.509> 12<00:02:04.229> 3<00:02:04.799> 6<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.670> 9<00:02:05.700> read

marks so you get a 12 3 6 and 9 read

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.059 
marks so you get a 12 3 6 and 9 read
which<00:02:06.719> again<00:02:06.960> ties<00:02:07.229> back<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> watch<00:02:07.829> face
