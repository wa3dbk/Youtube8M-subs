 measure 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.629
 as a contribution that walks the 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.560
 fanned like nothing my life that's why they walk 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.560
 saying to call the malquerida 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.580
 do not fear me writer the dead 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:02:02.710

 [Music] 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.610

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.950
 my way the play even if you lose 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:19.040
 starting because I love and I like to give 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.330
 life if he does not give me I do not want anything not me 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.950
 matter with 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:29.040
 and so am I brave to sell 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:34.740
 explosive that's why I said they found 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 the miscreant of the 68 thrown with my 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:45.110
 life that are saying to call 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.110

 I'm still a queen with no return 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.130
 they live there but one day 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.930
 I am the people to the explosive wind 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.890
 for hiding saying to finish the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.890
 malquerida 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.800
 confident life so I do not feel me 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.889
 life ends 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.889
