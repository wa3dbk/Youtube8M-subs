00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
 Hi friends, you who like my videos on 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.670
 youtube you have watch the videos 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:22.140
 Today I will make a special video for you. 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:28.500
 showing you is that you use this kind of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.170
 hta cards to pick up on the wireless internet 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 in case not 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.440
 It's the computer by itself if it can 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.890
 have a defect that is not 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 these cards depends on this 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.480
 computer here you see me 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.480
 was using this card she's 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.399
 I got normal and wifi everything right only 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.980
 but the money she got started came 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:07.520
 He takes the money failed could take 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:14.330
 Another day I failed and then linked and put 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.939
 this other d link card on the internet 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.850
 she kept failing sometimes 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.420
 it worked sometimes it was not a problem 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.350
 on my network because the tablet and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.759
 gadgets that we have here 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.630
 it worked normal then suddenly 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.170
 I was on the computer because being the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.720
 Internet 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.490
 looked and with a plate 10 still 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.290
 still a bad thing is to change the board 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 I put this other plate and effect 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.590
 persisted 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.290
 then the mayor came from within 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 computer is the duty of the computer is the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.579
 following the motherboard she is responsible 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 for identifying the signal from the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.360
 internet in case she has the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 components to receive the signal 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.530
 wifi that goes through this card and 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.170
 transmit into the computer 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.189
 if something goes wrong already in one's own 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 motherboard 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.580
 the plate is to take 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.900
 case of arrows certain internal component 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.760
 of the board to work 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.760
 so in case that happened to me this 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.099
 around with this cpu you're seeing that right 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.610
 the people are going to fight the cpu, then 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.470
 The computer you are seeing is this 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.500
 the plate it stopped working but 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.140
 not left over not only who plays the good is 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.650
 What did I do? 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.989
 We do not use the internet on cable rj 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.560
 45 We used this one here. 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.670
 so what happens and demands of today 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.670
 this little piece here you see 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.000
 This is a USB Wireless Networking Adapter 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.760
 usb wireless network so small 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.139
 if you are the size of a finger 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.709
 so since the plates did not work 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.420
 more 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:13.799
 and I did not want to use the internet on rj 45 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:31.400
 So I bought a little adapter and your 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:36.720
 work is a usb network card via usb 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.459
 the job is to install the program to 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.750
 make recognize because when you 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:48.169
 purchase this installation CD player 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.169
 on your computer 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:04:01.400
 for example you want to talk recorder 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.400
 of cd and dvd to the day that has to do 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.590
 Your computer will restart 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.590
 receive wireless signal 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.549
 this little piece that is here 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.900
 you are seeing this piece so small and 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.460
 this other adapter you are seeing 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:28.960
 here I have long been okay 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.660
 here is an adapter to make the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.940
 mobile phone transfer computer 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.380
 without putting the cars is also the youtube 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.710
 long time is that today no longer 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.400
 there is more of this size here existed 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.440
 Theses you can buy a mini that 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.849
 part outside my network here you can 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.009
 see nothing to this gigantic v3 group 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.539
 because he in the four years 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.520
 so if I had another little gadget 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.550
 stuck here you would not see anything but 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.289
 if my device is right here 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.599
 it is working then this 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.610
 computer to computer to mount a 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:12.310
 and complete computer on the Internet 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.190
 internet starts to fail 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.659
 You have to make sure it's not yours. 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.210
 internet provider 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:21.759
 if you have a tablet and 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.380
 cell phone and everything works normal only your 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.250
 computer is crashing 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.490
 if you use this type of board 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:44.889
 advisable that you have an equipment 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:48.550
 of this small computer she was 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:52.680
 straight and work on the motherboard 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.680
 of your computer is done internally 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:14.820
 today when the computer starts to lose 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:20.050
 the internet sign on the board 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:24.699
 in my case that icon of the board that 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.820
 It appears near the computer clock 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.729
 it turned red in the 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.589
 The truth was not yellow. 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.889
 red color off every time 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:38.289
 was on the icon that did not have 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.559
 network that did not 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:45.069
 communication is exactly from the 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:46.960
 motherboard is fine, but you 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.559
 I have doubts and questions that I give 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:55.740
 Best night orientations 17 85% in this 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:55.740
 video for you a hug for you
