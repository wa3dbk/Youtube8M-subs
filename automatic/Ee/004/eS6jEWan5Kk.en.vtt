00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
like to be a very grim situation just

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
like to be a very grim situation just
something<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.899> bad<00:01:46.140> let's<00:01:46.890> take<00:01:47.130> another

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
something not so bad let's take another

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
something not so bad let's take another
quick<00:01:47.759> look<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> decided<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
quick look at this one so I decided to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.929 
quick look at this one so I decided to
try<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.829> focus<00:01:50.009> down<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> field<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
try and focus down the field because I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.370 
try and focus down the field because I
know<00:01:51.060> he's<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> easiest<00:01:51.570> target<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
know he's the easiest target at the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.440 
know he's the easiest target at the
moment<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> Yasuo<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.549> obviously<00:01:54.149> going

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
moment but the Yasuo is obviously going

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.209 
moment but the Yasuo is obviously going
as<00:01:54.570> ham<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.930> he<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.259> me<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.979> freeze

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
as ham as he can on me and as I freeze

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.980 
as ham as he can on me and as I freeze
the<00:01:56.369> clip<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.180> obviously<00:01:57.450> out

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the clip you can see I'm obviously out

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
the clip you can see I'm obviously out
of<00:01:58.170> range<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.619> Yasuo<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.610> keep

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
of range of the Yasuo and if I keep

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
of range of the Yasuo and if I keep
running<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> my<00:02:00.299> base<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.780> should<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.170> safe<00:02:01.409> but

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
running to my base I should be safe but

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
running to my base I should be safe but
instead<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.670> shadows<00:02:03.119> position<00:02:03.689> from

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
instead I see my shadows position from

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.200 
instead I see my shadows position from
my<00:02:04.140> ultimate<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> used<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.189> Yasuo<00:02:05.670> earlier

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
my ultimate that I used on Yasuo earlier

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
my ultimate that I used on Yasuo earlier
and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> very<00:02:07.079> low<00:02:07.320> HP<00:02:07.530> fiddlesticks

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and I see the very low HP fiddlesticks

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.010 
and I see the very low HP fiddlesticks
is<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:08.670> beside<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.840> can

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
reason that I continued at our dive the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.360 
reason that I continued at our dive the
kale<00:02:48.030> used<00:02:48.389> her<00:02:48.569> ultimate<00:02:49.109> too<00:02:49.409> soon<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:50.040> lot<00:02:50.099> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
kale used her ultimate too soon a lot of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.039 
kale used her ultimate too soon a lot of
mistakes<00:02:50.639> kale<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.180> against<00:02:51.480> said<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.959> this

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
mistakes kale do against said and this

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.750 
mistakes kale do against said and this
is<00:02:52.170> something<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.769> abuse<00:02:53.159> is<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.519> fact

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is something I like to abuse is the fact

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.250 
is something I like to abuse is the fact
that<00:02:53.819> they<00:02:53.970> use<00:02:54.209> their<00:02:54.420> ultimate<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:55.200> too

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that they use their ultimate way too

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.140 
that they use their ultimate way too
soon<00:02:55.709> pretty<00:02:56.010> much<00:02:56.189> the<00:02:56.340> instant<00:02:56.819> my<00:02:56.909> death

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
soon pretty much the instant my death

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.699 
soon pretty much the instant my death
mark<00:02:57.389> applies<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.930> them<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.470> is

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
mark applies on them and this is

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.500 
mark applies on them and this is
incorrect<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.849> death<00:03:00.090> mark<00:03:00.329> will

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
incorrect because my death mark will

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.449 
incorrect because my death mark will
last<00:03:00.720> longer<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.319> thus<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.769> death<00:03:02.010> mark<00:03:02.250> will

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
last longer and thus my death mark will

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.640 
last longer and thus my death mark will
pop<00:03:02.760> on<00:03:02.970> her<00:03:03.120> after<00:03:03.659> her<00:03:03.810> ultimate<00:03:04.200> finishes

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
pop on her after her ultimate finishes

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.470 
pop on her after her ultimate finishes
so<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.310> being<00:03:05.489> said<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:05.819> continue<00:03:06.359> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
so that being said I just continue the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.240 
so that being said I just continue the
tower<00:03:06.750> dive<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.260> as<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.530> once<00:03:07.739> again<00:03:07.889> freeze

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
tower dive and as I once again freeze

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.979 
tower dive and as I once again freeze
the<00:03:08.400> clip<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.790> see<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.060> death<00:03:09.239> mark<00:03:09.480> pops

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
the clip you can see the death mark pops

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.960 
the clip you can see the death mark pops
after<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.349> ultimate<00:03:10.709> finish<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.549> hope<00:03:11.849> I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
after the ultimate finish so I hope I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.640 
after the ultimate finish so I hope I
don't<00:03:12.030> regret<00:03:12.269> saying<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.019> about<00:03:13.170> kale

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
don't regret saying this about kale

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.110 
don't regret saying this about kale
because<00:03:13.950> now<00:03:14.099> maybe<00:03:14.250> kills<00:03:14.639> will<00:03:14.819> know<00:03:14.939> how<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
because now maybe kills will know how to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.030 
because now maybe kills will know how to
play<00:03:15.359> against<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.870> better<00:03:16.139> for<00:03:16.530> regardless

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
play against that better for regardless

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.229 
play against that better for regardless
that's<00:03:17.129> usually<00:03:17.549> how<00:03:17.669> you<00:03:17.730> want<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.060> towerdive

that's usually how you want to towerdive

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.210
