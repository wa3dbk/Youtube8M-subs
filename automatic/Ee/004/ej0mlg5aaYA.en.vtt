00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.800
Octopus is already boiled

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.100

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.700
Five minute heating

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.900

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.900
It looks yummy

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.400

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.900
Salmon trout

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.400
It isn't the dark color so much

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.900
Is it because it's juicy?

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.700
Easy and tasty

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.000
