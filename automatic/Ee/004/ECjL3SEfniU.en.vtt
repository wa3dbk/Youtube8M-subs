standardized<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.150> test<00:00:45.420> scores<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:47.040> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
standardized the test scores and here I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
standardized the test scores and here I
heard<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.699> fourth<00:00:48.059> grade<00:00:48.330> slump<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.680> out

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
heard about a fourth grade slump so out

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.149 
heard about a fourth grade slump so out
of<00:00:49.920> curiosity<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:51.180> looked<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.409> two<00:00:52.710> past

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
of curiosity I looked at the two past

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.149 
of curiosity I looked at the two past
ten<00:00:53.370> years<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:54.390> students<00:00:54.930> data<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.589> I

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
ten years of my students data and I

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.240 
ten years of my students data and I
found<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:57.619> fourth<00:00:58.619> grade<00:00:58.890> slump

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
found actually fourth grade slump

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.609 
found actually fourth grade slump
happened<00:00:59.940> even<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.780> high-performing

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:01.619 
happened even to my high-performing

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.250 
happened even to my high-performing
students<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.339> found<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.420> students

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
students I found that my students

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.230 
students I found that my students
although<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.850> high<00:01:06.920> test<00:01:07.920> scores<00:01:08.240> but

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
although they have high test scores but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.179 
although they have high test scores but
they<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.960> good<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.530> explaining

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
they are not good at explaining

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.940 
they are not good at explaining
themselves<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:12.090> oral<00:01:12.420> English<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.920> was

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
themselves in oral English and I was

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.880 
themselves in oral English and I was
thinking<00:01:14.780> when<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.140> fourth<00:01:16.560> grade

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
thinking when they go to fourth grade

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.999 
thinking when they go to fourth grade
class<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:18.450> won't<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.229> bilingual<00:01:19.799> class

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
class they won't be in bilingual class

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.609 
class they won't be in bilingual class
anymore<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.270> their<00:01:21.659> teacher<00:01:21.930> won't<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.470> able

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
anymore so their teacher won't be able

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.640 
anymore so their teacher won't be able
to<00:01:22.799> use<00:01:23.790> their<00:01:24.270> home<00:01:24.479> language<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.229> support

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
to use their home language to support

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.630 
to use their home language to support
them<00:01:25.939> how<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> could<00:01:27.600> help<00:01:27.900> them<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.920> express

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
them how I could help them to express

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.349 
them how I could help them to express
themselves<00:01:30.359> in<00:01:31.020> English<00:01:32.030> energy<00:01:33.030> ask

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
themselves in English energy ask

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.749 
themselves in English energy ask
questions<00:01:34.109> in<00:01:34.320> English<00:01:34.499> and<00:01:35.039> to<00:01:35.070> display

those subjects that they are going to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.090 
those subjects that they are going to
learn<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.960> provide<00:01:46.350> prompt

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
learn so that they can provide prompt

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.520 
learn so that they can provide prompt
feedback<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.969> their<00:01:48.119> next<00:01:48.479> teacher<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.079> then

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
feedback to their next teacher and then

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.169 
feedback to their next teacher and then
the<00:01:49.679> next<00:01:49.979> teacher<00:01:50.219> can<00:01:50.549> adjust<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
the next teacher can adjust to the

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.679 
the next teacher can adjust to the
instruction<00:01:51.859> according<00:01:52.859> to<00:01:53.009> their<00:01:53.159> needs

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
instruction according to their needs

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
instruction according to their needs
that's<00:01:54.689> why<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> thought<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.770> reciprocal

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
that's why I thought of reciprocal

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.690 
that's why I thought of reciprocal
teaching<00:01:57.139> something<00:01:58.139> that<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.619> learned<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.639> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
teaching something that I learned when I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.590 
teaching something that I learned when I
was<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:01.039> graduate<00:02:02.039> student<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:03.090> reciprocal

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
was a graduate student the reciprocal

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
was a graduate student the reciprocal
teaching<00:02:03.749> is<00:02:04.170> based<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.219> gas<00:02:05.429> keys<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
teaching is based on the gas keys the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.620 
teaching is based on the gas keys the
theory<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.829> fundamental<00:02:08.460> role<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:09.000> social

not<00:03:46.139> logical<00:03:46.409> and<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.930> think<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.889> district

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
not logical and I think the district

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.369 
not logical and I think the district
should<00:03:51.199> consider<00:03:53.509> keeping<00:03:54.509> the<00:03:54.689> same<00:03:54.959> class

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
should consider keeping the same class

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.490 
should consider keeping the same class
size<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.159> increase<00:03:57.500> paraprofessional

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
size and increase paraprofessional

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.349
