but<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.680> doubt<00:02:31.069> there<00:02:31.310> would<00:02:31.459> be<00:02:31.520> any<00:02:31.880> left<00:02:32.270> to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
but I doubt there would be any left to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.540 
but I doubt there would be any left to
store<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.140> that's<00:02:34.040> it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
store and that's it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.540
