00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.779
 to 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.119
 let me start this video saying 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.879
 wow 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.040
 that thing whatever it is is really 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.710
 Awesome 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.630
 the new image presented in scott game 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.640
 dotcom shows us a scary 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.800
 animatronic accompanied by a date 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.879
 probably announcing the departure of 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.290
 face nights at fredys 4 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.930
 You probably already noticed it but below 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.989
 of this image is the word neymar or 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.480
 nightmare in Spanish this will be your name 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.700
 or its function 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.620
 At first glance it reminded me of one of the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.210
 first images of being prior to the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
 exit of the third game in which 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.740
 we saw a kind of bear with fangs 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.930
 but seeing the details it would seem not 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.850
 be yourself 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.860
 also looks more like freddy despite 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.410
 not have fangs the shape of their 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.360
 heads is the same could be about 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.119
 golden friend i am maybe freddy fuck 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.160
 see how Freddy became 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.160
 this disturbing nightmarish creature 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.640
 in fast bear frame you only had one 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.770
 animatronic oh and the reason was that it was the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.600
 only found in this attraction 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.490
 of terror could have turned 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.230
 this robot in a comparable machine 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.900
 only the most grotesque nightmare 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.730
 begotten on this planet but they at 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.580
 seem they did not have the resources to 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.070
 do what 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.350
 when the animatronics belonged to 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.030
 the pizzeria or the restaurant would have been 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.100
 unthinkable to convert one of your 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.780
 darling pets in something so bizarre 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.830
 that could scare children or even 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.770
 cause them some damage 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.870
 although this chilling character 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.120
 it seems more like one I am at some point 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.130
 someone theorized that he could have arrived 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.440
 to exist a prototype of animatronic or 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 a base design from which they departed for 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.770
 develop the models that we have 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.200
 known throughout these three 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 deliveries could be this new 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.430
 animatronic or that prototype 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.600
 On the other hand we have the word 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.640
 nightmare in the image if this were not 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.770
 the name of the animatronic or then 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.780
 could suggest that this character just 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.790
 is shown within a bad dream or that 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.070
 As in the third game is a 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.080
 kind of ghost that attacks the moment 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.300
 in which you fail to prevent yourself from being overwhelmed 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.560
 for any condition or circumstance 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.720
 adverse to the environment in which you 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.520
 you find just like what happened with the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.520
 ghost animatronics 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.950
 or it could be a real ghost 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.540
 just as the children came to persecute 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.760
 to his killer without the need of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.470
 use the animatronics just 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.600
 after being dismantled 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.550
 there could be the possibility that 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.680
 this being was a kind of entity 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.440
 disembodied with the ability to attack 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.300
 just as golden freddy did if the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.550
 purple man died harboring a large 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.560
 resentment hate and pain could 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.450
 have become altered the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.220
 vision which follows what remains of 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.220
 his old animatronic body or 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.349
 on the other hand there is a theory that says 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.599
 that the purple man felt 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.120
 repented for everything he did and the 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.330
 final left this life after apologizing for 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.010
 somehow for all the damage it caused 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.840
 could the purple man be the victim 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.390
 of this nightmare and this scary 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.850
 animatronic or could be your torturer 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.980
 to get to regret it must have happened 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.080
 for an equally frightening experience 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.330
 to which he made his victims pass such 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.360
 once at some point the killer came to 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.260
 run into this monster at least 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.260
 inside your mind
