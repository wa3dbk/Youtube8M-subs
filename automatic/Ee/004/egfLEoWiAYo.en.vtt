revisited because this is the fourth
prototype<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.699> puzzle<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.180> may<00:00:18.720> have

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
prototype of the puzzle you may have

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.470 
prototype of the puzzle you may have
seen<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> other<00:00:19.920> prototypes<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:21.210> my

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
seen one of the other prototypes on my

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.590 
seen one of the other prototypes on my
youtube<00:00:22.170> channel<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.970> version

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
youtube channel and this is the version

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.009 
youtube channel and this is the version
that<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.949> perfect<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> let

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that we think is really perfect so let

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.220 
that we think is really perfect so let
me<00:00:28.170> demonstrate<00:00:28.699> how<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.760> puzzle<00:00:30.359> works<00:00:30.599> as

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
me demonstrate how the puzzle works as

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
me demonstrate how the puzzle works as
you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:32.460> are<00:00:32.579> six<00:00:33.059> bolts<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.690> they

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you can see there are six bolts and they

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.819 
you can see there are six bolts and they
are<00:00:34.110> connected<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.340> loop<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:37.050> for

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
are connected in a loop so you can for

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.680 
are connected in a loop so you can for
instance<00:00:37.860> fold<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.780> hexagon<00:00:40.350> or

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
instance fold them like a hexagon or

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.830 
instance fold them like a hexagon or
well<00:00:42.690> maybe<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.610> triangle<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.629> see

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
well maybe a triangle and what you see

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.940 
well maybe a triangle and what you see
is<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.530> balls<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.309> connected<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:48.590> one<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
is the balls are connected all one to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.090 
is the balls are connected all one to
the<00:00:50.070> next<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.300> ball<00:00:51.590> clamps<00:00:52.590> around<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the next so this ball clamps around the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.750 
the next so this ball clamps around the
next<00:00:53.399> one

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
next one

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.560 
next one
etc<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.770> said<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.430> make<00:00:56.910> multiple

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
etc so as I said you can make multiple

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
etc so as I said you can make multiple
shapes<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.800> triangle<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.460> showed<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
shapes this is a triangle I showed the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.869 
shapes this is a triangle I showed the
hexagon<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.260> also<00:01:01.440> fold<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.520> like

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
hexagon but you can also fold it like

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.050 
hexagon but you can also fold it like
this<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> interesting<00:01:04.739> things

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
this and then the interesting things

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
this and then the interesting things
start<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.869> make<00:01:07.080> an<00:01:07.290> astrolabe<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.100> case

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
start you can make an astrolabe a case

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.530 
start you can make an astrolabe a case
move<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:10.049> puzzle<00:01:10.380> turns<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.540> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
move so the puzzle turns like this and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.350 
move so the puzzle turns like this and
then<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> make<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.770> straight<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.460> another

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
then you can make it straight or another

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
then you can make it straight or another
move<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:17.700> fold<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.119> like

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
move that you can do is to fold it like

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480 
move that you can do is to fold it like
a<00:01:18.360> cube<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.500> fold<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a cube and to fold it back in a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
a cube and to fold it back in a
different<00:01:20.850> direction<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.740> yet<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:22.799> move

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
different direction or yet another move

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.719 
different direction or yet another move
is<00:01:23.820> turn<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.689> from<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> length<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is turn it from the length to this I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.249 
is turn it from the length to this I
have<00:01:26.880> no<00:01:27.060> clue<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> net<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
have no clue what the net would be the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.859 
have no clue what the net would be the
name<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.740> move<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.610> anyway<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
name of that move but anyway it's a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.179 
name of that move but anyway it's a
great<00:01:31.560> move

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
great move

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.730 
great move
so<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> rectangular<00:01:34.259> shape

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
so now we are in the rectangular shape

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.640 
so now we are in the rectangular shape
again<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.360> showed<00:01:36.930> several<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
again and as I showed several of the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
again and as I showed several of the
moves<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:38.130> slowly<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> puzzle<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.049> be

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
moves very slowly but the puzzle can be

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.940 
moves very slowly but the puzzle can be
played<00:01:40.700> very<00:01:41.700> quickly<00:01:42.450> where<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.619> fold

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
played very quickly where you just fold

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.880 
played very quickly where you just fold
it<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.430> shift<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:46.020> move<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it and shift it and do one move and the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340 
it and shift it and do one move and the
other<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> time<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.600> well<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
other all at the time and well the
