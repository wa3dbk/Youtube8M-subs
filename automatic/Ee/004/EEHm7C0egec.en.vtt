00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
and I yeah i'll show you how it works

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.630 
and I yeah i'll show you how it works
because<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:48.080> can<00:00:48.260> do<00:00:49.040> quite<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.250> few<00:00:49.309> things

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640

but<00:00:49.790> it's<00:00:49.940> quite<00:00:50.090> good<00:01:07.330> option<00:01:08.330> too<00:01:08.509> but<00:01:09.250> usual

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
but it's quite good option too but usual

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.170 
but it's quite good option too but usual
