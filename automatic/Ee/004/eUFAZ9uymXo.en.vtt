00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.490 
opposed to just go into lockdown it
would<00:02:26.970> let<00:02:27.180> our<00:02:27.270> teachers<00:02:27.600> know<00:02:27.870> where<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
would let our teachers know where the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.790 
would let our teachers know where the
threat<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:30.290> they<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.500> evaluate

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
threat is and then they can evaluate

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.790 
threat is and then they can evaluate
whether<00:02:32.730> or<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.600> location<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.620> their

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
whether or not the location of their

whether or not the location of their
classroom<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.670> best<00:02:36.570> served<00:02:36.870> by<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.140> locking

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
intruder is in let's say the lobby area

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.170 
intruder is in let's say the lobby area
of<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.870> school<00:02:49.140> how<00:02:49.980> far<00:02:50.370> away<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.970> your

of the school how far away is your

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.720 
of the school how far away is your
child's<00:02:51.600> classroom<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.250> teacher<00:02:53.460> was

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
child's classroom if the teacher was

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.510 
child's classroom if the teacher was
provided<00:02:54.240> with<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.480> type<00:02:54.990> of<00:02:55.020> information

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
provided with that type of information

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120 
provided with that type of information
could<00:02:56.520> they<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:56.850> get<00:02:57.210> out<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> school

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
could they not get out of the school

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.340 
could they not get out of the school
entirely<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.700> would<00:03:00.210> that<00:03:00.390> be<00:03:00.600> safer<00:03:01.110> for

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
entirely and would that be safer for

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.040 
entirely and would that be safer for
your<00:03:01.440> child<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:02.280> simply<00:03:02.730> huddling<00:03:03.600> down<00:03:03.810> in

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
your child then simply huddling down in

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.190 
your child then simply huddling down in
a<00:03:04.140> corner<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.950> locked<00:03:05.220> room<00:03:05.600> probably<00:03:06.600> so

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
a corner in a locked room probably so

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.830 
a corner in a locked room probably so
but<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> also<00:03:08.190> realized<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.030> lockdown

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
but I also realized that lockdown

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.620 
but I also realized that lockdown
sometimes<00:03:10.380> may<00:03:10.710> be<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:11.130> only<00:03:11.310> option<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.450> we

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
sometimes may be the only option but we

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.470 
sometimes may be the only option but we
must<00:03:12.900> expand<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.860> lockdown<00:03:14.270> into<00:03:15.270> not<00:03:15.450> only

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
must expand the lockdown into not only

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.260 
must expand the lockdown into not only
locking<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> door<00:03:16.770> but<00:03:17.280> barricading<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.120> as

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
locking the door but barricading it as

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.960 
locking the door but barricading it as
well<00:03:18.740> you<00:03:19.740> think<00:03:19.980> barricade<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.460> sounds

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
well you think barricade that sounds

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.940 
well you think barricade that sounds
extreme<00:03:21.360> well<00:03:21.930> let's<00:03:22.170> think<00:03:22.350> about<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.710> we've

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
extreme well let's think about it we've

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.950 
extreme well let's think about it we've
got<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> lock<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.670> door<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.120> we've<00:03:24.630> got<00:03:24.870> an

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
got a lock on the door and we've got an

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.740 
got a lock on the door and we've got an
armed<00:03:25.320> intruder<00:03:25.470> with<00:03:25.950> some<00:03:26.130> type<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.460> firearm

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
armed intruder with some type of firearm

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.420 
armed intruder with some type of firearm
take<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> look<00:03:28.050> at<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.230> classroom<00:03:28.500> door<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.190> all

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
take a look at the classroom door in all

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.510 
take a look at the classroom door in all
likelihood<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:30.660> door<00:03:31.320> has<00:03:31.920> some<00:03:32.160> type<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.370> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
likelihood that door has some type of a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.970 
likelihood that door has some type of a
window<00:03:32.970> immediately<00:03:33.270> next<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.470> lock<00:03:34.709> that

window immediately next to the lock that

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.610 
window immediately next to the lock that
could<00:03:35.130> easily<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.790> broken<00:03:36.000> out<00:03:36.360> allowing<00:03:37.350> the

could easily be broken out allowing the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.040 
could easily be broken out allowing the

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
suspect to make entry he could even

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.410 
suspect to make entry he could even
shoot<00:03:40.290> shoot<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.310> lock<00:03:41.520> off<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> door<00:03:42.239> for

shoot shoot the lock off of the door for

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.400 
shoot shoot the lock off of the door for
that<00:03:42.480> matter<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.620> important<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.400> our

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
that matter so it's important that our

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.990 
that matter so it's important that our

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:50.589 
of the building it was really not useful

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.289 
of the building it was really not useful
