00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.000 
don't try to keep your thumb above like
that<00:03:33.450> you'll<00:03:33.810> never<00:03:33.990> be<00:03:34.140> able<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.380> stretch

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
that you'll never be able to stretch

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.440 
that you'll never be able to stretch
that<00:03:35.250> far<00:03:35.480> unless<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.780> gigantic<00:03:37.320> hands

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
that far unless you have gigantic hands

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.780 
that far unless you have gigantic hands
so<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.020> tipple<00:03:40.440> map<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.580> thumb

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
so that's the tipple map and the thumb

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.260 
so that's the tipple map and the thumb
should<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.030> directly<00:03:43.100> in<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.730> center<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.060> your

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
should be directly in the center of your

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:54.320 
should be directly in the center of your
hand<00:03:45.510> when<00:03:45.630> you're<00:03:45.750> doing<00:03:46.020> that<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:53.330> then

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
hand when you're doing that so then

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.540 
hand when you're doing that so then
you're<00:03:54.540> sliding<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.200> slide<00:03:55.530> into<00:03:56.430> the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
you're sliding this slide into the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.490 
you're sliding this slide into the
seventh<00:03:56.940> fret<00:03:57.120> for<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.420> D<00:03:57.630> chord<00:03:59.420> these<00:04:00.500> five

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
seventh fret for the D chord these five

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.640 
seventh fret for the D chord these five
four<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:01.920> three<00:04:02.100> strings<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:03.300> D<00:04:03.570> let's<00:04:04.560> say

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
four and three strings the D let's say

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.150 
four and three strings the D let's say
the<00:04:04.739> G<00:04:04.980> D<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.550> g<00:04:05.760> strings<00:04:06.680> using<00:04:07.680> my<00:04:07.890> thumb

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
the G D and the g strings using my thumb

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.740 
the G D and the g strings using my thumb
first<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.820> second<00:04:09.270> finger<00:04:10.850> your<00:04:11.850> thumb<00:04:11.910> this

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
first and second finger your thumb this

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.080 
first and second finger your thumb this
string<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> D<00:04:13.769> on<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.070> seven

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
string here the D on the seven

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.400 
string here the D on the seven
then<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:16.600> root<00:04:16.840> D<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:22.050> link<00:04:23.050> number<00:04:23.139> two

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
then the root D so link number two

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:46.830 
then the root D so link number two
really<00:04:23.680> slowly

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.650 

okay<00:04:47.840> that's<00:04:48.050> lick<00:04:48.229> number<00:04:48.289> two
