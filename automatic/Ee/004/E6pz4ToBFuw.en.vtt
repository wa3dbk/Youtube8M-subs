nice<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.650> know<00:02:14.740> if<00:02:14.920> you're<00:02:15.070> especially<00:02:15.640> if

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
nice you know if you're especially if

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.240 
nice you know if you're especially if
you're<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.510> know<00:02:16.570> used<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.590> do<00:02:17.740> things

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
you're you know used to do things

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.180 
you're you know used to do things
quickly<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.390> also<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.960> nice<00:02:20.200> drop<00:02:20.710> back<00:02:20.980> down

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
quickly and also a nice drop back down

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.650 
quickly and also a nice drop back down
there<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.430> slightly<00:02:25.030> different<00:02:25.390> from

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
there this is slightly different from

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.360 
there this is slightly different from
the<00:02:25.900> original<00:02:25.930> mean<00:02:26.590> bean<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.220> they're

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
the original mean bean but they're

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.890 
the original mean bean but they're
pretty<00:02:27.550> much<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.030> same<00:02:28.210> because<00:02:28.570> this<00:02:28.750> is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
pretty much the same because this is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.560 
pretty much the same because this is
actually<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.770> ported<00:02:30.100> version<00:02:30.460> it<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.150> actually

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
actually a ported version it is actually

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.940 
actually a ported version it is actually
based<00:02:32.530> off<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.040> verizon<00:02:33.610> rom<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.380> built<00:02:35.380> now

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
based off the verizon rom and built now

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.610 
based off the verizon rom and built now
