plastic<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> window<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.630> both<00:02:31.100> back

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
plastic with a window for both back

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.570 
plastic with a window for both back
touch<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.970> camera<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.740> take<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> normal

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
touch and the camera so we take a normal

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.890 
touch and the camera so we take a normal
Vita<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.450> stick<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.290> number<00:02:38.070> one

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
Vita and we stick it in as number one

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.100 
Vita and we stick it in as number one
number<00:02:39.900> two<00:02:41.000> lock<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.180> into<00:02:42.330> place<00:02:42.540> by<00:02:42.840> pushing

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
number two lock it into place by pushing

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.070 
number two lock it into place by pushing
it<00:02:43.320> down<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.210> I<00:02:45.470> think<00:02:46.470> that's<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
it down and I think that's it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.390 
it down and I think that's it
feels<00:02:49.080> pretty<00:02:49.320> sturdy

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
feels pretty sturdy

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.640 
feels pretty sturdy
I<00:02:54.110> feel<00:02:55.160> more<00:02:56.160> resistance<00:02:56.790> than<00:02:56.880> before

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
I feel more resistance than before

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.960 
I feel more resistance than before
so<00:02:58.970> yeah<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.300> mean<00:03:01.050> it's<00:03:01.460> still<00:03:02.460> got<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> Vita

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
so yeah I mean it's still got the Vita

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.810 
so yeah I mean it's still got the Vita
weight<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:04.350> feels<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.340> little<00:03:05.430> different

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
weight and it feels a little different

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.080 
weight and it feels a little different
now<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.330> holding<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.310> more<00:03:08.310> not

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
now you know holding it as more not

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.380 
now you know holding it as more not
quite<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:09.900> holding<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.260> controller<00:03:10.470> but

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
quite and like holding a controller but

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.850 
quite and like holding a controller but
it<00:03:12.390> does<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> different<00:03:13.020> feel<00:03:13.200> now<00:03:13.620> that

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
it does have a different feel now that

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.220 
it does have a different feel now that
has<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> little<00:03:14.700> bit<00:03:14.820> more<00:03:15.000> plastic<00:03:15.630> there<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
has a little bit more plastic there and

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.050 
has a little bit more plastic there and
a<00:03:17.100> little<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:18.260> concave<00:03:19.260> design<00:03:19.440> here<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.880> is

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
a little more concave design here it is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780 
a little more concave design here it is
pretty<00:03:21.450> comfortable<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.230> your<00:03:23.160> fingers<00:03:23.550> can

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
pretty comfortable and your fingers can

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.949 
pretty comfortable and your fingers can
still<00:03:24.290> get<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> good<00:03:25.770> region<00:03:26.430> behind<00:03:26.959> even

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
still get a good region behind even

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.410 
still get a good region behind even
though<00:03:28.080> there<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.440> more<00:03:28.920> more<00:03:29.760> mass<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.300> the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
though there is more more mass on the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.250 
though there is more more mass on the
side<00:03:30.660> but<00:03:31.650> um<00:03:31.830> yeah<00:03:32.790> I'll<00:03:33.090> try<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.720> out<00:03:33.930> for<00:03:34.200> a

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
side but um yeah I'll try it out for a

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.220 
side but um yeah I'll try it out for a
couple<00:03:34.830> days<00:03:34.980> ever<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.000> often<00:03:36.209> then<00:03:37.080> we'll

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
couple days ever so often then we'll

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.890 
couple days ever so often then we'll
come<00:03:37.410> back<00:03:37.440> see<00:03:37.950> how<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.670> end<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.720> is

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
come back see how it is in the end it is

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.870 
come back see how it is in the end it is
notable<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.220> does<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.580> cover

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
notable that you know it does not cover

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.699 
notable that you know it does not cover
up<00:03:42.000> these<00:03:42.660> ports<00:03:43.310> game<00:03:44.310> port<00:03:45.260> does<00:03:46.260> not<00:03:46.470> cover

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
up these ports game port does not cover

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.050 
up these ports game port does not cover
it<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.250> can<00:03:47.370> still<00:03:47.610> open<00:03:47.640> up<00:03:47.940> your

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
it up so you can still open up your

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.910 
it up so you can still open up your
games<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.840> can<00:03:48.959> still<00:03:49.170> turn<00:03:49.320> it<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.800> off

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
games you can still turn it on and off

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.180 
games you can still turn it on and off
of<00:03:50.580> course<00:03:50.850> your<00:03:51.000> shoulder<00:03:51.269> buttons<00:03:51.540> are<00:03:51.720> now

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
of course your shoulder buttons are now

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.990 
of course your shoulder buttons are now
these<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.570> as<00:03:54.570> well<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.860> does<00:03:55.980> not<00:03:56.310> cover<00:03:56.610> your

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
these and as well it does not cover your

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.530 
these and as well it does not cover your
memory<00:03:57.870> card<00:03:58.140> or<00:03:58.519> your<00:03:59.519> cable<00:04:00.090> port<00:04:00.360> or

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
memory card or your cable port or

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.229 
memory card or your cable port or
headphone<00:04:01.290> jack<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:02.340> even<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> serial<00:04:03.090> port

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
headphone jack or even the serial port

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.560 
headphone jack or even the serial port
so<00:04:03.709> it's<00:04:04.709> good<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.010> know<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.489> did<00:04:05.940> not<00:04:06.090> cover

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
so it's good to know that did not cover

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.840 
so it's good to know that did not cover
anything<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.200> only<00:04:07.380> thing<00:04:07.590> now<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:08.040> if<00:04:08.730> you

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
out of luck not that I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.570 
out of luck not that I
gonna<00:04:12.659> use<00:04:12.810> one<00:04:12.989> for<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:13.290> anyway<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:14.010> all

gonna use one for this anyway but all

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.060 
gonna use one for this anyway but all
right<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:14.909> I've<00:04:15.150> used<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:16.019> trigger<00:04:16.530> grips<00:04:16.829> for

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
right so I've used the trigger grips for

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.400 
right so I've used the trigger grips for
about<00:04:17.340> I'd<00:04:18.060> probably<00:04:18.209> say<00:04:18.449> about<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.660> month<00:04:18.840> now

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
pretty non-stop this thing's been on and

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.920 
pretty non-stop this thing's been on and
I<00:04:22.800> have<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.130> say<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.669> does<00:04:24.000> feel<00:04:24.270> really<00:04:24.300> nice

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
I have to say it does feel really nice

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.330 
I have to say it does feel really nice
and<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.350> really<00:04:25.710> get<00:04:25.830> used<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:27.889> grip<00:04:28.889> the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
and you really get used to the grip the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.439 
and you really get used to the grip the
fact<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.760> feels<00:04:30.000> more<00:04:30.120> like<00:04:30.300> a

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
fact that it feels more like a

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.290 
fact that it feels more like a
controller<00:04:30.720> now<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.979> there<00:04:32.699> there<00:04:33.030> are<00:04:33.120> some

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
controller now and there there are some

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.580 
controller now and there there are some
good<00:04:33.449> other<00:04:33.630> good<00:04:33.870> stuff<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.229> feels<00:04:34.410> like<00:04:34.560> a

controller
you<00:04:35.400> know<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.790> triggers<00:04:36.479> feel<00:04:36.690> good<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:38.220> know

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.340 
you know the triggers feel good you know
you<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.639> really<00:04:38.820> do<00:04:38.940> get<00:04:39.090> used<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.449> it<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.720> the

you can really do get used to it and the
fact<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.889> grip<00:04:41.100> is<00:04:41.250> here<00:04:41.699> on<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.419> on<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
fact that the grip is here on the on the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.810 
fact that the grip is here on the on the
sides<00:04:43.080> here<00:04:43.320> really<00:04:44.010> feel<00:04:44.220> good<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.610> hand

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
sides here really feel good on the hand

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.840 
sides here really feel good on the hand
and<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:46.320> know<00:04:46.400> pressing<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.460> buttons<00:04:47.729> is

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
and you know pressing the buttons is

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.420 
and you know pressing the buttons is
still<00:04:48.030> whatever<00:04:48.270> but<00:04:48.660> I<00:04:49.039> do<00:04:50.039> feel<00:04:50.400> like

still whatever but I do feel like
sometimes<00:04:51.169> reaching<00:04:52.169> out<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.620> this<00:04:52.830> could<00:04:52.979> be

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
sometimes reaching out and this could be

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.219 
sometimes reaching out and this could be
a<00:04:53.070> bit<00:04:53.250> good<00:04:53.400> or<00:04:53.520> bad<00:04:53.639> thing<00:04:53.910> reaching<00:04:54.810> for<00:04:55.169> the

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
a bit good or bad thing reaching for the

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.240 
a bit good or bad thing reaching for the
back<00:04:55.410> touch<00:04:57.199> when<00:04:58.199> you're<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.830> know<00:04:58.860> pressing

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
back touch when you're you know pressing

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.950 
back touch when you're you know pressing
buttons<00:04:59.520> may<00:04:59.910> be<00:04:59.970> a<00:05:00.120> little<00:05:00.449> more<00:05:00.570> difficult

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
buttons may be a little more difficult

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.890 
buttons may be a little more difficult
since<00:05:01.110> there<00:05:01.199> is<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.710> more<00:05:02.370> space<00:05:02.900> being

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
since there is that more space being

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.320 
since there is that more space being
taken<00:05:04.199> up<00:05:04.320> but<00:05:05.280> you<00:05:05.520> can<00:05:05.639> also<00:05:05.789> see<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.210> as

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
taken up but you can also see it as

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.210 
taken up but you can also see it as
you're<00:05:06.630> not<00:05:06.720> accidentally<00:05:07.440> pressing<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:08.039> you

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
you're not accidentally pressing it you

you're not accidentally pressing it you
know<00:05:08.669> every<00:05:08.910> once<00:05:09.060> in<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.270> while<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.660> that

know every once in a while and that

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.140 
know every once in a while and that
could<00:05:09.900> be<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> good<00:05:10.139> thing<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:11.070> goes<00:05:11.760> back<00:05:12.030> and

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
could be a good thing it goes back and

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
the back touch screen which is really

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.430 
the back touch screen which is really
good<00:05:54.060> they<00:05:54.300> add<00:05:54.419> two<00:05:54.570> layer<00:05:54.750> of<00:05:54.870> protection<00:05:55.200> to

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
good they add two layer of protection to

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.909 
good they add two layer of protection to
it<00:05:55.590> does<00:05:56.250> not<00:05:56.400> really<00:05:56.639> help<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:57.060> front<00:05:57.360> but<00:05:58.050> it

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
it does not really help the front but it

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.680 
it does not really help the front but it
is<00:05:59.130> what<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.430> is<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.820> this<00:05:59.940> device<00:06:00.300> was<00:06:00.510> not

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
is what it is and this device was not

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.670 
is what it is and this device was not
meant<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:00.960> do<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:02.150> so<00:06:03.150> I<00:06:03.510> definitely<00:06:04.229> would

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
meant to do that so I definitely would

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.409 
meant to do that so I definitely would
recommend<00:06:04.710> this<00:06:05.190> for<00:06:05.250> anyone<00:06:05.639> with<00:06:05.820> a<00:06:05.849> Vita

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
recommend this for anyone with a Vita

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.969 
recommend this for anyone with a Vita
because<00:06:07.349> it<00:06:07.470> feels<00:06:07.830> great<00:06:08.150> and<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:10.680> really

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
because it feels great and the really

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.670 
because it feels great and the really
thing<00:06:11.490> you<00:06:11.639> need<00:06:11.820> to<00:06:11.880> realize<00:06:12.210> is<00:06:12.419> that<00:06:12.570> if<00:06:13.440> you

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
thing you need to realize is that if you

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.140 
thing you need to realize is that if you
try<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.099> put<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:14.430> in<00:06:14.550> your<00:06:14.580> pocket

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
try to put this in your pocket

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150 
try to put this in your pocket
it<00:06:15.300> just<00:06:15.510> is<00:06:16.440> gonna<00:06:16.650> be<00:06:16.800> really<00:06:17.039> uncomfortable

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
it just is gonna be really uncomfortable

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.000 
it just is gonna be really uncomfortable
it<00:06:17.669> just<00:06:17.820> doesn't<00:06:18.210> gonna<00:06:18.360> happen<00:06:18.660> I<00:06:19.010> really

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
it just doesn't gonna happen I really

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.370 
it just doesn't gonna happen I really
can't<00:06:20.280> say<00:06:20.640> portability<00:06:21.599> wise<00:06:21.960> it's<00:06:22.229> any

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
can't say portability wise it's any

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.330 
can't say portability wise it's any
better<00:06:23.240> but<00:06:24.240> I<00:06:24.510> guess<00:06:25.440> in<00:06:25.740> that<00:06:25.800> aspect

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
better but I guess in that aspect

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.120 
better but I guess in that aspect
it<00:06:26.580> does<00:06:26.790> come<00:06:27.150> short<00:06:27.480> but<00:06:28.440> it<00:06:28.620> really<00:06:28.830> wasn't

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
it does come short but it really wasn't

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.730 
it does come short but it really wasn't
meant<00:06:29.430> to<00:06:29.639> make<00:06:29.850> it<00:06:29.910> more<00:06:30.360> portable<00:06:30.630> it<00:06:31.500> makes

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
meant to make it more portable it makes

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.920 
meant to make it more portable it makes
a<00:06:31.830> lot<00:06:32.040> less<00:06:32.070> portable<00:06:32.550> but<00:06:33.480> it<00:06:33.600> makes<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:33.900> a

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
a lot less portable but it makes it a

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.590 
a lot less portable but it makes it a
lot<00:06:34.020> more<00:06:34.230> comfortable<00:06:34.500> so<00:06:35.460> if<00:06:36.330> you're<00:06:36.479> going
