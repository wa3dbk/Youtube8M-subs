00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
actually launched this before we let it

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.980 
actually launched this before we let it
to<00:01:15.810> any<00:01:15.990> other<00:01:16.170> market<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> market

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.650 
able to able to repair the the situation
we<00:02:14.800> have<00:02:14.830> we<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.670> caused<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.270> moving

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
we have we have caused and moving

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.410 
we have we have caused and moving
forward<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> tremendous<00:02:18.490> experience

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
forward what the tremendous experience

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720 
forward what the tremendous experience
for<00:02:19.960> learning<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.530> has<00:02:20.770> been<00:02:20.980> they've<00:02:21.460> taken

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
for learning this has been they've taken

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.630 
for learning this has been they've taken
the<00:02:22.060> learning<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.660> when<00:02:23.230> symbian3<00:02:23.740> comes<00:02:24.370> out

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
the learning and when symbian3 comes out

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.460 
the learning and when symbian3 comes out
you<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.330> rest<00:02:25.540> assured<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.930> it'll<00:02:26.290> be

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
you can rest assured that it'll be

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.550 
you can rest assured that it'll be
perfect<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.420> obvious<00:02:28.510> question<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:29.230> with

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
perfect so the obvious question is with

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.100 
perfect so the obvious question is with
the<00:02:29.740> n97<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> combination<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.540> software

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the n97 it is a combination of software

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.280 
the n97 it is a combination of software
and<00:02:32.550> hardware<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.690> made<00:02:35.020> any<00:02:35.050> changes

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and hardware have you made any changes

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.740 
and hardware have you made any changes
to<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.010> quality<00:02:36.700> control<00:02:37.120> process<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.660> ensure

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
to the quality control process to ensure

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.450 
to the quality control process to ensure
that<00:02:38.170> kind<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.410> thing<00:02:38.560> doesn't<00:02:38.860> happen<00:02:39.070> again

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
that kind of thing doesn't happen again

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.450 
that kind of thing doesn't happen again
yeah<00:02:39.940> actually<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:40.990> it's<00:02:41.440> exactly<00:02:42.340> like

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
yeah actually it this it's exactly like

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.420 
yeah actually it this it's exactly like
you<00:02:42.730> say<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.300> quality<00:02:43.990> control<00:02:44.830> process

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
you say it is quality control process

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.610 
you say it is quality control process
and<00:02:46.240> actually<00:02:46.810> these<00:02:46.960> things<00:02:47.320> are<00:02:47.500> not

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
and actually these things are not

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.500 
and actually these things are not
quality<00:02:48.190> control<00:02:48.700> at<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.090> end<00:02:49.270> of

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
quality control at the end of

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.660 
quality control at the end of
manufacturing<00:02:50.320> but<00:02:50.890> they<00:02:51.070> are<00:02:51.220> quality

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
manufacturing but they are quality

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.820 
manufacturing but they are quality
control<00:02:52.120> measures<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.780> are<00:02:52.840> in<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.350> outset

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
control measures that are in the outset

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.640 
control measures that are in the outset
of<00:02:53.890> setting<00:02:54.550> up<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:55.030> program<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.840> deliver<00:02:56.290> this

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
of setting up a program to deliver this

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.590 
of setting up a program to deliver this
whole<00:02:56.890> thing<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.970> exactly<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
whole thing and that is exactly the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.110 
whole thing and that is exactly the
learning<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.440> have<00:02:59.650> taken<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.340> has

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
learning that we have taken and that has

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.370 
learning that we have taken and that has
gone<00:03:01.390> into<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:02.380> symbian3<00:03:03.280> as<00:03:03.850> well<00:03:04.660> as<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
gone into the symbian3 as well as to the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.740 
gone into the symbian3 as well as to the
products<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.070> actually<00:03:06.220> come<00:03:06.820> based<00:03:07.510> on

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
products that actually come based on

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.770 
products that actually come based on
symbian<00:03:08.140> symbian3<00:03:09.070> how<00:03:10.030> do<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.360> feel<00:03:10.570> that

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
symbian symbian3 how do you feel that

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.300 
symbian symbian3 how do you feel that
this<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:10.960> a<00:03:11.110> time<00:03:11.410> scale<00:03:11.680> for<00:03:11.800> doing<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.190> sort

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
this is a time scale for doing that sort

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.490 
this is a time scale for doing that sort
of<00:03:12.400> thing<00:03:12.460> is<00:03:12.730> between<00:03:13.090> major<00:03:13.630> point<00:03:14.200> releases

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
that's where that's where you need to do

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.940 
that's where that's where you need to do
it<00:03:18.910> because<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.330> know<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:20.410> what<00:03:20.650> we<00:03:20.800> did

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
it because you know you like what we did

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.040 
it because you know you like what we did
in<00:03:21.220> terms<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.060> software<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.510> was<00:03:22.780> there

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
in terms of the software that was there

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.070 
the the thing doesn't hold together
anymore<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.730> they're<00:03:37.300> there<00:03:37.600> for<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.930> know

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.310 
anymore and they're there for you know
even<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.800> patching<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:39.850> was<00:03:40.750> much<00:03:41.050> more

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
even the patching of this was much more

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.240 
even the patching of this was much more
laborious<00:03:41.770> than<00:03:42.100> what<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.489> ever<00:03:42.520> thought<00:03:44.250> yeah

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
laborious than what we ever thought yeah

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.790
