00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
hand take the ball in their right hand

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
reach behind their right ear if they're

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.590 
reach behind their right ear if they're
again<00:00:39.520> if<00:00:39.610> there<00:00:39.760> are<00:00:39.820> right-handed<00:00:40.300> thrower

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
again if there are right-handed thrower

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.779 
again if there are right-handed thrower
so<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.440> ball<00:00:41.620> should<00:00:41.859> be<00:00:41.949> stretched<00:00:42.280> out<00:00:42.489> far

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
so that ball should be stretched out far

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.450 
so that ball should be stretched out far
behind<00:00:43.059> their<00:00:43.480> behind<00:00:43.930> their<00:00:44.109> head<00:00:44.460> next

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
behind their behind their head next

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.770 
behind their behind their head next
thing<00:00:45.579> you'll<00:00:45.699> do<00:00:45.820> is<00:00:45.850> Simon<00:00:46.420> Says<00:00:46.600> take<00:00:46.719> a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
thing you'll do is Simon Says take a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.509 
thing you'll do is Simon Says take a
small<00:00:47.199> step<00:00:47.440> three<00:00:47.859> or<00:00:47.949> four<00:00:48.100> inches<00:00:48.340> with

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
small step three or four inches with

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.880 
small step three or four inches with
that<00:00:48.670> left<00:00:49.149> foot<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:50.050> they'll<00:00:50.199> step<00:00:50.440> forward

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
that left foot so they'll step forward

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.439 
that left foot so they'll step forward
toward<00:00:51.129> their<00:00:51.250> target<00:00:51.699> kind<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.090> point<00:00:52.300> their

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
toward their target kind of point their

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.689 
toward their target kind of point their
toe<00:00:52.719> torta<00:00:53.199> and<00:00:53.379> I<00:00:53.710> suggest<00:00:53.920> having<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.399> cone

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
toe torta and I suggest having a cone

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.069 
toe torta and I suggest having a cone
out<00:00:55.000> in<00:00:55.179> front<00:00:55.390> on<00:00:55.510> where<00:00:55.660> they<00:00:55.750> can<00:00:55.870> throw

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
out in front on where they can throw

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.020 
out in front on where they can throw
towards<00:00:56.500> and<00:00:56.679> then<00:00:57.550> you'll<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:57.789> them<00:00:57.969> in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
towards and then you'll have them in

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.369 
towards and then you'll have them in
that<00:00:58.179> position<00:00:58.359> and<00:00:58.840> then<00:00:58.929> you<00:00:58.989> can<00:00:59.140> just<00:00:59.289> let

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
that position and then you can just let

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.110 
that position and then you can just let
them<00:00:59.530> finish<00:00:59.710> with<00:01:00.010> Simons's<00:01:00.519> throw<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.910> ball

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
them finish with Simons's throw the ball

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.700 
them finish with Simons's throw the ball
while<00:01:01.539> you<00:01:01.660> move<00:01:01.809> your<00:01:01.989> right<00:01:02.140> foot<00:01:02.440> across

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
while you move your right foot across

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.049 
while you move your right foot across
from<00:01:03.010> your<00:01:03.160> left<00:01:03.339> foot<00:01:03.609> so<00:01:03.820> it'll<00:01:03.940> look

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
from your left foot so it'll look

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.980 
from your left foot so it'll look
something<00:01:04.269> like<00:01:04.510> this<00:01:06.510> okay<00:01:07.510> then<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:07.840> can

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
something like this okay then you can

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.930 
something like this okay then you can
have<00:01:08.170> an<00:01:08.430> suggestion<00:01:09.430> would<00:01:09.490> be<00:01:09.550> to<00:01:09.640> have<00:01:09.820> them

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
have an suggestion would be to have them

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.550 
have an suggestion would be to have them
have<00:01:10.060> several<00:01:10.450> tennis<00:01:10.750> balls<00:01:10.960> behind<00:01:11.200> them

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
have several tennis balls behind them

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.870 
have several tennis balls behind them
and<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.740> recommend<00:01:12.130> using<00:01:12.280> tennis<00:01:12.640> balls

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
and I recommend using tennis balls

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.520 
and I recommend using tennis balls
because<00:01:13.240> they're<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> lot<00:01:13.540> softer<00:01:13.870> if<00:01:14.230> a<00:01:14.290> child

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
because they're a lot softer if a child

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.690 
because they're a lot softer if a child
gets<00:01:14.650> hit<00:01:14.890> with<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.190> they're<00:01:15.310> not<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.640> be

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
gets hit with it they're not going to be

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.760 
gets hit with it they're not going to be
intimidated<00:01:15.970> in<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.510> future<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.080> they<00:01:17.590> use<00:01:17.740> a

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
intimidated in the future and they use a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.340 
intimidated in the future and they use a
little<00:01:18.040> harder<00:01:18.400> baseball<00:01:18.910> soft<00:01:19.720> tee<00:01:19.930> ball<00:01:20.110> for

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
little harder baseball soft tee ball for

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.990 
little harder baseball soft tee ball for
the<00:01:20.380> games<00:01:20.680> but<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.130> wouldn't<00:01:21.460> recommend<00:01:21.490> using

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
the games but I wouldn't recommend using

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.020 
the games but I wouldn't recommend using
those<00:01:22.150> for<00:01:22.390> practice

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
another throwing drill that you can do

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.499 
another throwing drill that you can do
for<00:01:29.710> t-ball<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.670> teach<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.000> kids<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.240> throw
