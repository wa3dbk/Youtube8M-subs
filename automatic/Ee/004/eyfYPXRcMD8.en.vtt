us through how you guys bring that to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.240 
us through how you guys bring that to
life<00:00:29.489> using<00:00:29.970> real<00:00:30.419> people<00:00:30.779> sure<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:32.009> time

life using real people sure this time
and<00:00:32.489> call<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.239> duty<00:00:33.360> black<00:00:33.420> ops<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.989> were

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
and call of duty black ops we were

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.170 
and call of duty black ops we were
trying<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.620> our<00:00:34.920> actors<00:00:35.430> emote<00:00:35.970> better

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
trying to have our actors emote better

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.420 
trying to have our actors emote better
and<00:00:36.420> connect<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> player<00:00:37.620> better<00:00:37.950> so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and connect with the player better so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.380 
and connect with the player better so
that<00:00:38.579> when<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.880> sense<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.239> their

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that when you get a sense of their

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.700 
that when you get a sense of their
emotion<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.199> they're<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.500> through

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
emotion and what they're going through

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.349 
emotion and what they're going through
and<00:00:40.769> with<00:00:40.920> their<00:00:41.039> experience<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.120> through

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
and with their experience so through

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.060 
and with their experience so through
that<00:00:42.480> process<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:43.140> developed<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.620> technique

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that process we developed a technique

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220 
that process we developed a technique
called<00:00:44.129> full<00:00:44.640> performance<00:00:45.090> capture<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
called full performance capture and that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.259 
called full performance capture and that
involves<00:00:46.559> us<00:00:46.829> recording<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> body<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.030> face

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
involves us recording the body the face

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.569 
involves us recording the body the face
and<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.840> voice<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.289> same<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.429> in<00:00:50.519> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and the voice at the same time so in a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700 
and the voice at the same time so in a
motion<00:00:50.760> capture<00:00:51.210> studio<00:00:51.269> we<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.870> scores<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
motion capture studio we have scores of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
motion capture studio we have scores of
cameras<00:00:53.160> tracking<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.879> reflective

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
cameras tracking these reflective

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.419 
cameras tracking these reflective
markers<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.989> these<00:00:55.109> guys<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.559> their<00:00:56.010> body<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
markers on these guys on their body and

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.950 
markers on these guys on their body and
their<00:00:56.609> face<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.629> their<00:00:57.750> full

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
their face so we get their full

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
their face so we get their full
performance<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.620> once<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.120> our

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
performance at once so when we have our

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
performance at once so when we have our
actors<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.929> we<00:01:00.989> bring<00:01:01.199> them<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.499> the<00:01:01.620> scene<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
actors and we bring them to the scene we

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.290 
actors and we bring them to the scene we
start<00:01:02.249> explaining<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> them<00:01:02.820> what<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
start explaining to them what is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.490 
start explaining to them what is
involved<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:03.929> scene<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.290> how<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
involved in the scene like how the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
involved in the scene like how the
action<00:01:05.010> comes<00:01:05.309> into<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.880> leaves<00:01:06.120> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
action comes into it and leaves the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
action comes into it and leaves the
scene<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:07.440> let<00:01:07.650> them<00:01:07.800> go<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.490> let<00:01:08.670> them

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
scene we let them go and we let them

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
scene we let them go and we let them
start<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.090> act<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.570> give<00:01:09.690> them<00:01:09.840> their<00:01:09.900> basic

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
start to act we give them their basic

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.230 
start to act we give them their basic
direction<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.010> they<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.520> their<00:01:11.670> lines<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
direction and they know their lines and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
direction and they know their lines and
then<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:12.780> they're<00:01:13.410> able<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> bring

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
then from there they're able to bring

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
then from there they're able to bring
the<00:01:14.490> scene<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.790> life<00:01:14.940> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:15.870> there<00:01:16.050> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the scene to life you know I'm there to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
the scene to life you know I'm there to
kind<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.440> guide<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> rules<00:01:17.550> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
kind of guide them on what the rules of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.980 
kind of guide them on what the rules of
the<00:01:17.760> games<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.540> where<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:18.840> should

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the games are and where they should

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.330 
the games are and where they should
start<00:01:19.260> and<00:01:19.440> end<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> where<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.010> action<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
start and end and where the action is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.400 
start and end and where the action is
coming<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.480> ultimately<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.290> their

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
coming from but ultimately it's their

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.200 
coming from but ultimately it's their
performance<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.190> take<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.790> bring<00:01:23.910> into

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
performance that we take and bring into

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.710 
performance that we take and bring into
the<00:01:24.300> game<00:01:24.510> so<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.760> when<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.330> our

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the game so you know when we know our

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
the game so you know when we know our
design<00:01:28.050> of<00:01:28.170> our<00:01:28.260> level<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.980> break<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.370> down

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
design of our level we break that down

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
design of our level we break that down
we<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.270> where<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.540> unique<00:01:30.900> animations

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
we know where these unique animations

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
we know where these unique animations
need<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> we're<00:01:32.130> still<00:01:32.430> storytelling

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
need to go we're still storytelling

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.880 
need to go we're still storytelling
elements<00:01:33.600> need<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.680> from<00:01:34.800> there

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
elements need to go and then from there

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.050 
elements need to go and then from there
we<00:01:35.190> go<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> motion<00:01:35.730> capture<00:01:36.000> studio

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
we go to the motion capture studio

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.360 
we go to the motion capture studio

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
have been using this technology for

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.870 
have been using this technology for
years<00:01:49.980> can<00:01:50.160> talk<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.550> how<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.670> guys

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
years can talk about how you guys

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.960 
years can talk about how you guys
develop<00:01:51.300> this<00:01:51.450> absolutely<00:01:52.550> yeah<00:01:53.550> we<00:01:53.850> have

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
develop this absolutely yeah we have

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
develop this absolutely yeah we have
been<00:01:54.150> using<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.510> years<00:01:54.840> back<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.590> call

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
been using this for years back on call

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.400 
been using this for years back on call
of<00:01:56.430> duty<00:01:56.610> 3<00:01:56.940> actually<00:01:57.690> we've<00:01:57.840> been<00:01:57.960> using<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
of duty 3 actually we've been using it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.650 
of duty 3 actually we've been using it
even<00:01:58.830> before<00:01:59.460> then<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
even before then but that one is when I

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.090 
even before then but that one is when I
got<00:02:00.900> heavily<00:02:01.110> involved<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
got heavily involved with that and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.160 
got heavily involved with that and
before<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.030> way<00:02:03.150> we<00:02:03.330> record<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.990> full

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
before the way we record a full

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.750 
before the way we record a full
performance<00:02:04.650> like<00:02:04.800> say<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.980> scene<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.580> you're

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
performance like say a scene that you're

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.430 
performance like say a scene that you're
trying<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.030> tell<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> part<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.480> the<00:02:06.570> story<00:02:06.840> we

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
trying to tell a part of the story we

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.900 
trying to tell a part of the story we
would<00:02:07.560> break<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.830> up<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.069> three<00:02:08.190> parts<00:02:08.429> we'd

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
would break it up in three parts we'd

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.490 
would break it up in three parts we'd
record<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> body<00:02:09.509> first<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.080> then<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.410> go

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
record the body first and then we go

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
record the body first and then we go
into<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.800> sound<00:02:11.009> booth<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> record<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> audio

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
into the sound booth to record the audio

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.000 
into the sound booth to record the audio
and<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.870> go<00:02:13.019> back<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.410> animate<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> face

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and then we go back and animate the face

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.790 
and then we go back and animate the face
when<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.390> lose<00:02:15.800> continuity

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
when you do that you lose continuity

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.490 
when you do that you lose continuity
lose<00:02:17.160> fidelity<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.110> emotions<00:02:19.110> are<00:02:19.200> harder<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
lose fidelity the emotions are harder to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.930 
lose fidelity the emotions are harder to
capture<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.190> all<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.520> anime

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
capture and it's all on the anime

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.000 
capture and it's all on the anime
to<00:02:21.150> try<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.390> inject<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.380> into<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.770> scene

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to try and inject that into the scene

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.520 
to try and inject that into the scene
this<00:02:23.670> way<00:02:23.910> since<00:02:24.210> we're<00:02:24.420> recording<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:25.080> three

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
this way since we're recording all three

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.890 
this way since we're recording all three
at<00:02:25.650> once<00:02:25.970> everything<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.000> we<00:02:27.210> get<00:02:27.480> from<00:02:27.510> that

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
at once everything that we get from that

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.660 
at once everything that we get from that
scene<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.440> raw<00:02:28.680> basically<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.370> see<00:02:29.550> is

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
scene is raw basically what you see is

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.220 
scene is raw basically what you see is
what<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.910> get<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.510> says<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> animators

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
what you get and that says the animators

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.410 
what you get and that says the animators
get<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.500> bring<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.770> back<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.370> maybe<00:02:32.880> tweak

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
get to bring that back and maybe tweak

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.710 
get to bring that back and maybe tweak
or<00:02:33.630> plus<00:02:33.930> or<00:02:34.170> finesse<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.370> bit<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.270> now<00:02:36.570> what

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
or plus or finesse it a bit but now what

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.120 
or plus or finesse it a bit but now what
we<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.080> something<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.800> much<00:02:37.980> more

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
we have is something so much more

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
realistic so much more emotional and as
