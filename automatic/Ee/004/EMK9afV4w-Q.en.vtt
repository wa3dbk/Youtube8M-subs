00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
2 on PC I actually own it for the PC it

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880 
2 on PC I actually own it for the PC it
is<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> great<00:01:11.520> great<00:01:11.700> great<00:01:12.240> game<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.409> cannot

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
is a great great great game and I cannot

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.630 
is a great great great game and I cannot
wait<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.369> play<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> Xbox<00:01:15.810> 360<00:01:16.610> now<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
wait to play it on the Xbox 360 now I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
wait to play it on the Xbox 360 now I
figured<00:01:18.450> I'd<00:01:18.540> pick<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> Xbox

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
figured I'd pick it up on the Xbox

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
figured I'd pick it up on the Xbox
because<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.680> kind<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.790> compare<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because I kind of do like a compare and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
because I kind of do like a compare and
contrast<00:01:21.900> between<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.100> PC<00:01:23.490> version<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
contrast between the PC version and the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.370 
contrast between the PC version and the
Xbox<00:01:24.390> 360<00:01:24.869> version

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
Xbox 360 version

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
Xbox 360 version
now<00:01:25.619> obviously<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.189> P<00:01:26.369> server<00:01:26.610> PC<00:01:27.180> version

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
now obviously the P server PC version

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.749 
now obviously the P server PC version
sorry<00:01:28.140> looks<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.860> lot<00:01:29.070> better<00:01:29.400> obviously<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
sorry looks a lot better obviously and

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
sorry looks a lot better obviously and
obviously<00:01:32.759> probably<00:01:33.000> runs<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.600> lot<00:01:33.810> better<00:01:34.049> but

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
obviously probably runs a lot better but

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.780 
obviously probably runs a lot better but
I<00:01:34.470> did<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> compare<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.310> contrast<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
I did want to compare and contrast the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.940 
I did want to compare and contrast the
two<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.750> picked<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> Xbox<00:01:37.740> 360

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
more act 3 act 3 and you have the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.940 
more act 3 act 3 and you have the
prologue<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.269> have<00:04:21.389> more<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:22.200> all<00:04:22.830> the

prologue and you have more of all the
acts<00:04:23.130> there<00:04:23.490> now<00:04:24.180> there's<00:04:24.630> an<00:04:24.720> introduction
