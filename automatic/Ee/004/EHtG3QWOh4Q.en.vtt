a cool function I can write down a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.790 
a cool function I can write down a
formula<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.939> easily<00:00:27.810> find<00:00:28.019> an<00:00:28.199> answer<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800

this it's as easy as that and I'll write
down<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> better<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:49.100> now<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> formulas<00:00:50.700> been

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
down a better one now the formulas been

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.479 
down a better one now the formulas been
recognized<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:51.960> find<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> answer

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
recognized so let's find the answer

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
recognized so let's find the answer
which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> show<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.050> side
