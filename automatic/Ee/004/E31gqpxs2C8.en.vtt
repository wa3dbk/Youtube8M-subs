00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 taking into account that the morphology is the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.720
 note on the gold brake is 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.519
 understandable that many creators op 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.769
 for starting their animals' campaign 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.660
 in an exhibition 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.570
 so in the following report we 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.750
 let us clarify which are the divisions and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.609
 subdivisions of a morphological exposition 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.230
 more than that bring tips that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.230
 can assist in the presentation 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.330
 of course I can not have a horse 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 momentum with a volume of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.360
 January 17 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.210
 now a strict mare 38 trade 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 rigorously harmonious wall that has 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.120
 of 17 or 18 of summer does not draw attention 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.700
 the most logical exposures of males and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.170
 females separated into categories according to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.870
 With the age 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.129
 are shown mounted to first 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 I jog and trot and gallop 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.440
 then the order is pulled to halter 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.439
 input is also set the quality of the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 the older the judgment is 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.540
 the best of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 each row is analyzed and then it is 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.330
 chosen the category champion in the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.060
 when a mare is elected as 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.820
 category champion is immediately 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.130
 replaced by reserved for it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.869
 continue to compete for the four 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
 best of each category 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.240
 the most important moment of the exhibition is 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.490
 the great championship the dispute between the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 category winners 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.079
 if the adult horse was the great champion 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 booked with an adult comes to 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.140
 to compete against the formed line of the four 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.920
 the best exposure of both males 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.700
 how many females 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 the 2014 cycle ends in August and 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.610
 we now had 98 morphological exposures 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.310
 officers of the race involving 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.920
 participation of four thousand eight hundred and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 sixty-three animals, not counting 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.070
 passports and caucuses on the Expointer 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.619
 to meet this demand for one year and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.050
 half Raphael sent a training center 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.810
 morphology in the hut three errors in 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.060
 the southern border of the country 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.440
 Uruguay 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.660
 today we like animals here in the area 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.470
 of the great river of the south of paraná and são 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.069
 Paulo 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.980
 Here the work starts early half past five 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.019
 the morning of the first meal that is 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.530
 given three times a day 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.540
 rather bulky use than the alpha I use 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.760
 pretty green people plant will come 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.170
 came here and food is more or less 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.670
 the one is a kilo ends up like this in 100 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.709
 pounds of live weight is more or less this 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.650
 that we are using the calculation seems 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.950
 simple but not everyone respects and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.350
 Exaggeration can become a problem 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.090
 there are animals that are a 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.970
 being overly prepared and super 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.380
 fed and who sometimes get the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.700
 volume proportions of sizes 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.579
 disproportionate to their normal age 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.230
 these animals are super fed from 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.239
 move up 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.370
 they eat much more than I need to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.590
 much less than they should in the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.069
 center of preparation of the cabanha three mistakes 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.530
 the bed of stables and rice straw 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.049
 Yes, it's full, you have to have enough bed. 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.950
 and also has been cleaned every day two 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.489
 times a day 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.430
 why is gnl cleaning by talking in 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.879
 hygiene or hair care is essential 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.280
 especially at this time of year in the south 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.799
 From Brazil, the cold thickens the hair of the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.609
 horse and to keep it down is necessary 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:48.870
 crawling three times a day and more 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.040
 give up the house completed 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.129
 morphology goes beyond caring for 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.870
 exercise is 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.959
 indispensable 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.750
 the animals assembled and we teach them 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.430
 and skirt troxa in the field I do not use clue 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.069
 that in my house does not have an I 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.049
 I have sand so the whole job is 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.359
 exclusively in the field where people 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.419
 teaches animals from the tank to agent 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.209
 I trotted a lot and galloped what is 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.310
 If you need it at the top on the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.889
 morphological judgment the work to 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.460
 field and done three times a week goes 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.050
 15 to 50 minutes depending on the preparation 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.909
 animal's physical 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.460
 then an exercise they do until 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.440
 as thanks, only half an hour goes 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.360
 an hour a potter will always have it 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.020
 freedom and their development is 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.240
 rafael guarantees that this freedom 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.190
 reassures animals, which reflects in the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.409
 temperament on track 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.550
 there are several cases of animals being 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.370
 withdrawn 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.680
 the ipê analyzed drastically by 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.159
 negative temper demonstrations 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.729
 and further prevent jurors 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.530
 adequately analyze the result in the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.500
 is the balance between state 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.949
 physical musculature temperament and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.979
 drive the horse that has 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.169
 conversion articulate and I projects 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.710
 walk he walks like the cat 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.860
 the cat has not dispersed movement is 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.500
 Forward movement is not 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.830
 there is an overly brother suspension 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.710
 his 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.470
 is against the ground forward's it 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.210
 translate correction in the case of leather 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.520
 conversion we must articulate this the ideal 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.100
 is that the hut stands between the tip of the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.320
 muzzle and the horse's palette 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.260
 if you stay behind and prevent it 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.290
 forward and forward can go to false 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.690
 print that is dragging the animal 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.880
 rafael explains that when the horse leaves 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.610
 from the stride to the trot it's time to 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.470
 correct what a horse does not like 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.660
 to do is go back 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.130
 so you have to make retreat do is walk 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.130
 back to walk back can not really 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.780
 back there touch his forehead try to put 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.910
 he to walk again is 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.120
 it follows a natural service that has to 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.670
 be done even stride forward stride 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.610
 way passes and he advanced and that's it 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.920
 has to be made the correction should be 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.170
 done is always a search since the 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.420
 brake can hurt the mouth 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.150
 the daily exercise time varies from 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.950
 according to the evolution of the training 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.830
 when the animal is locking well 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.740
 one tip is to bring another horse to the track 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.170
 the idea is to simulate a line of judgment 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.930
 so the presence of another animal on the day 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.200
 exposure will not interfere with 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.040
 presentation in addition to the 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.350
 judgment 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.650
 the stop also judges the enchanted 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.720
 Maico is walking the horses on time. 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.400
 that he stopped I 'm directing the 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.950
 Brand has to get the paw forward 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.230
 hand to the door behind and only 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.780
 items in 2 whats the matter with him 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.280
 will not be able to identify if he 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.020
 said good or evil 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.240
 when the horse balances the point of 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.700
 support without bending over to the 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.280
 Stretching the paws is time for the knight 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.760
 leave it still without pulling forward or 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.400
 back so the animal learned to stop 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.720
 then the correct positioning to 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.270
 rest 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.610
 Walking and walking are two things. 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.610
 which requires patience and training as well
