you

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.509 

what<00:00:25.539> up<00:00:25.630> what<00:00:25.779> up<00:00:25.840> what<00:00:26.140> up<00:00:26.189> okay<00:00:27.189> to<00:00:27.250> hear

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
what up what up what up okay to hear

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.820 
what up what up what up okay to hear
this<00:00:27.699> is<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.000> first<00:00:28.390> bgg<00:00:28.840> I've<00:00:29.109> done<00:00:29.289> at<00:00:29.410> 90

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
this is the first bgg I've done at 90

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.990 
this is the first bgg I've done at 90
and<00:00:32.040> frankly<00:00:33.040> I<00:00:33.070> had<00:00:33.190> no<00:00:33.520> idea<00:00:33.550> what<00:00:33.850> I'm<00:00:33.970> doing

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
and frankly I had no idea what I'm doing

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.819 
and frankly I had no idea what I'm doing
but<00:00:34.329> I<00:00:34.480> guess<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.930> basic<00:00:35.290> principle<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.770> to

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
but I guess the basic principle is to

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.670 
but I guess the basic principle is to
hold<00:00:36.129> as<00:00:36.340> many<00:00:36.579> orbs<00:00:37.000> of<00:00:37.120> us<00:00:37.270> for<00:00:37.600> many<00:00:38.470> of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
hold as many orbs of us for many of

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.250 
hold as many orbs of us for many of
those<00:00:38.829> orbs<00:00:39.309> as<00:00:39.460> possible<00:00:40.330> and<00:00:40.480> try<00:00:40.989> not<00:00:41.199> to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
those orbs as possible and try not to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.290 
those orbs as possible and try not to
die<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:45.489> fine<00:00:45.760> with<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.000> greenwise

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
die so we're fine with the greenwise

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.160 
die so we're fine with the greenwise
it's<00:00:47.230> up<00:00:47.379> there
