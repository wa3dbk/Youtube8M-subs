00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
specifically we're going to demonstrate

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.740 
specifically we're going to demonstrate
how<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> fill<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> holes<00:00:10.759> with<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> putty<00:00:12.120> that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
how to fill the holes with a putty that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.200 
how to fill the holes with a putty that
matches<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> stain<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.549> let's<00:00:14.730> get<00:00:14.880> into<00:00:15.179> our

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
matches the stain so let's get into our

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.359 
matches the stain so let's get into our
demonstration<00:00:15.990> before<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:16.980> into<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
demonstration before we get into the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.480 
demonstration before we get into the
demonstration<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.150> thought<00:00:18.390> we'd<00:00:18.539> do<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> quick

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
demonstration I thought we'd do a quick

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
demonstration I thought we'd do a quick
walkthrough<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> project<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.650> were

what's involved some nice stone work
there<00:00:45.079> all<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.289> cabinetry<00:00:47.070> has<00:00:47.850> been<00:00:48.059> made

all the trim has been stained and then
clear<00:01:04.500> coated<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:06.260> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> process<00:01:07.890> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
clear coated and in the process of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.320 
clear coated and in the process of
course<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:09.860> lot<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> nail<00:01:11.250> holes<00:01:11.580> are<00:01:11.880> produced

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
course a lot of nail holes are produced

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
course a lot of nail holes are produced
in<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> wood<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> be

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
in the wood and so they have to be

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.640 
in the wood and so they have to be
filled<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> I'll<00:01:19.920> show<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.159> how<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
filled so I'll show you how we do that

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
filled so I'll show you how we do that
you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.340> Stila<00:01:23.610> frame<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.240> we're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you can see this Stila frame that we're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
you can see this Stila frame that we're
going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.689> working<00:01:24.900> off<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
going to be working off it's on the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
going to be working off it's on the
inside<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> storage<00:01:27.030> area<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.869> why

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
inside of the storage area that's why

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.539 
inside of the storage area that's why
the<00:01:28.140> walls<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.759> raw<00:01:30.030> plywood<00:01:31.549> doesn't

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the walls are just raw plywood doesn't

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.959 
the walls are just raw plywood doesn't
have<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> finished

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.520 

but<00:01:36.969> you<00:01:37.119> can<00:01:37.270> see<00:01:37.509> on<00:01:37.840> closer<00:01:38.560> examination

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
but you can see on closer examination

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.419 
but you can see on closer examination
that<00:01:41.530> there<00:01:41.770> are<00:01:41.979> male<00:01:42.909> holes<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.189> way

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
that there are male holes all the way

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:52.050 
that there are male holes all the way
down<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:49.469> these<00:01:50.469> have<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.740> be<00:01:50.890> filled<00:01:51.819> of

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
down and these have to be filled of

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.499 
down and these have to be filled of
course<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.740> have<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.100> find<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.970> matching

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
course we have to find the matching

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.539 
course we have to find the matching
putty<00:01:58.289> if<00:01:59.289> we<00:01:59.500> can't<00:01:59.740> find<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.130> matching

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
putty if we can't find the matching

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.200 
putty if we can't find the matching
putty<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.860> off<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.189> shelf<00:02:03.399> we<00:02:03.670> have<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.000> mix

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
putty right off the shelf we have to mix

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.139 
putty right off the shelf we have to mix
it<00:02:04.420> but<00:02:05.289> that's<00:02:05.439> for<00:02:05.679> another<00:02:05.740> video<00:02:06.130> show<00:02:07.090> you

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
it but that's for another video show you

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.050 
it but that's for another video show you
the<00:02:07.390> putty<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.619> had<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.979> match<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.580> using

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
the putty and we had to match this using

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.539 
the putty and we had to match this using
a<00:02:10.149> combination<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.989> colors<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.370> the

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
a combination of colors you can see the

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.890 
a combination of colors you can see the
consistency<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:16.030> can<00:02:16.209> pinch<00:02:16.750> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
consistency of it it you can pinch a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.229 
consistency of it it you can pinch a
little<00:02:17.170> piece<00:02:17.349> off<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.790> what<00:02:18.940> we're<00:02:19.090> actually

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
little piece off and what we're actually

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:28.500 
little piece off and what we're actually
going<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.930> do<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.980> create<00:02:24.209> small<00:02:27.510> torpedo

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
going to do is create small torpedo

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.660 
going to do is create small torpedo
