 It includes what we are here to put on a 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:03.280
 side here the pedals look 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.730

 Charles 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.240
 For the day

 manuals that are put to read disc 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.120

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 and here it brings 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.210
 this thing that I suppose is to be able 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.200
 screw the steering wheel to that base and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.200
 let's get this out 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.100
 and there is what is the steering wheel 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.740
 good as you can versions of all 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.740
 cables 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.760
 this for such appreciate what 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.060
 are the changes brings them in the part of 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.070
 behind the wheel here I have a small 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.000
 button where you can change the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.479
 3a pc precision setting this in 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.700
 the part here trade 3 buttons 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.649
 basically the playstation buttons 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.360
 the buttons on each side and good as 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.970
 can see during mistakes 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.880
 it automatically has release too 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.300
 it seems to me this the back brings what 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.570
 which are the connector to synchronize it 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.180
 with pedals gentlemen this that are 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.070
 on this side and here is the cable that is 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 can synchronize perfectly as 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.410
 places and why buy this flyer 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.540
 this when he recommended me kim that is 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.310
 the one who has nothing else I found 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.700
 very cheap mercadolibre for that reason what 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.459
 I bought immediately it cost me 600 pesos 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.080
 already with shipping I do not know how many have 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.120
 seller or how many they have now is very 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.950
 cheap and if they are going to buy anything else 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.650
 so that one or the other game east of 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.480
 Application dance cars invest so much 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.330
 the truth is steering wheel is seen that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.990
