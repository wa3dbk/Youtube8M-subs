00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.700
 and it lacks the fifth and last group that 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.400
 personality disorder 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.130
 formerly called the ash of 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.980
 best- known psychopathic personality 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.150
 nor French pp but how did he get mean 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.910
 pejorative or cursing of the other 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 changed to personality disorder 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.670
 who won exactly this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 are people whose personality shapes 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.079
 outside the usual standards that the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.329
 society expects society to demand 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.210
 we live in the social world 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.090
 no one saw a desert island the new one 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.949
 society and society has 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.859
 about our expectations 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.989
 we all have how to fulfill certain 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.809
 roadmap within society 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.989
 we have a profession we must have 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.140
 a financial gain that will allow our 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.910
 survival is our autonomy 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 in principle it should not seek a 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.820
 partner in life to join himself 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.460
 which is not definitive 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.579
 but we need to live with 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 someone is a woman without much 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.880
 need to have children is important 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.009
 for they have children 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.200
 many have a job and that they 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.840
 did the job not only want to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.220
 earn clear money who want to win 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.409
 money but also perform some 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.600
 thing then all this should only have one 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.299
 expectation about these people 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 we have fulfilled this expectation only 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.140
 that there are people who are not so 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.810
 to meet the expectation of the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.290
 society are to have a life 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.600
 much too much to say 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.509
 will much with your own 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.159
 criteria and then collides with 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.409
 the norms of society 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.829
 When this happens we call this 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.740
 personality disorder because by 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.439
 example an expectation that we have in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.550
 life its social headquarters is that people 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.649
 they communicate 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.580
 I have to have friends, I have to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.920
 like to do programs 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.850
 I have to leave the house I have to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.950
 flirt 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.200
 Anyway, I have to deal with the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.800
 people but some people are not 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.920
 like this 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.710
 Extremely Extremely Closed 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.050
 introvert does not weave our nothing 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.140
 interested in social life 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.540
 they are very much within themselves in 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.430
 Ankle side itself let's be one 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.590
 personality disorder that is not 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.940
 corresponding to the expectation of the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.060
 society 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.880
 another example is the society that 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.550
 people are organized do not 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.709
 messy our things bother the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.709
 others but there are people who are 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.180
 too organized are perfectionist 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:03.400
 their lives are all ruled by 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.860
 be sure straight - laced organized it takes 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 this bothers the others in general then 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.040
 we are such a neat person 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.050
 too much too perfectionist so 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.870
 too demanding of himself and the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.850
 other one is not does not match the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.790
 expectations of the personality then 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.570
 it is a personality disorder and so 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.070
 these kind of people in this type right now 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.620
 in the same way that I am 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.480
 writing their own they realized that the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.150
 personality disorder and 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.050
 neuroses corresponds very much to what I 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.500
 I spoke at the beginning 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.450
 the abnormal variation of the way you are 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.950
 in fact the society that does not want 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.010
 people be like that 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.320
 they want to be like this I saw how to live well 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.620
 with these things of them but only 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.459
 accepted and makes them a problem for 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.130
 this here 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.890
 the current of thought that says no 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.830
 these are not violence diseases when 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.860
 people are characteristics 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.140
 peculiarities but they and can command 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.360
 the other principal is the person who is 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.430
 so be it so is not doing 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.250
 no evil is not causing a 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.420
 tragedy no evil because who will 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.720
 to contract the disease 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.140
 while the forced Frey anoxia 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.620
 dementia and psychosis does not correspond 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.479
 to the idea 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.000
 vencimental because they have a 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.300
 cerebral alteration or support 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.370
 evidenced or supposed to be the most 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.650
 neurosis a personality trait 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.850
 we can not determine the singer 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.250
 celebrated none 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.560
 however that even with these investigate 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.430
 modern technologies of the kind I 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.190
 I spoke before 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.650
 positron emission tomography at the 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.930
 Single photon emission tomography is 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.910
 a test for a wave I do not have this 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.020
 even then why is this a 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.419
 mental disease 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.660
 this is actually can be a variation 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.240
 because of the normal from where 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.850
 It came out the idea that this is normal 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.770
 then there is a current of thought that 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.539
 rise up against it for those who do not 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.940
 consider this as an illness 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.740
 legally it is not so because in the 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.930
 Severe disease classification is there 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.770
 both personality disorder with the 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.600
 neuroses 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.610
 therefore officially are diseases 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.050
 mental but we can question 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.430
 seriously if these entities 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.289
 exactly corresponds to the concept of 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.289
 ventimental in the broad sense of the word
