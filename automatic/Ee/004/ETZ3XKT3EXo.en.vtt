00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
America in a row five months so there's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.149 
America in a row five months so there's
something<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.259> slowing<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.950> know

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
something that's slowing down I know

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.880 
something that's slowing down I know
it's<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> past<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> future<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.470> today

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
it's the past not the future but today

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.090

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
PMI for the service industry it was

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
PMI for the service industry it was
lower<00:01:59.369> than<00:01:59.399> expected<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.810> month<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
lower than expected and the one month is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.889 
lower than expected and the one month is
now<00:02:01.350> below<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> three<00:02:02.040> months<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.490> America<00:02:03.329> so

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
now below the three months in America so

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.450 
now below the three months in America so
I<00:02:03.930> don't<00:02:04.380> think<00:02:04.710> there's<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> whole<00:02:05.219> lot<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
I don't think there's a whole lot of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.639 
I don't think there's a whole lot of
room<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> raise<00:02:06.299> rates<00:02:06.630> without<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
room to raise rates without really

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.740 
room to raise rates without really
tripping<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.369> economy<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
tripping up the economy and on the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
tripping up the economy and on the

gold<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.040> see<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.400> trend<00:02:17.790> continuing

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
gold do you see this trend continuing

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.580 
gold do you see this trend continuing
well<00:02:19.050> i<00:02:19.080> think<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.160> u.s.<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.610> sort<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
well i think that the u.s. is sort of a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.640 
well i think that the u.s. is sort of a
bifurcated<00:02:22.590> economy<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.440> i<00:02:25.440> think

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
bifurcated economy right now and i think

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.320 
bifurcated economy right now and i think
that<00:02:25.800> part<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.250> engine<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.700> still<00:02:26.880> moving

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that part of the engine is still moving

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.900 
that part of the engine is still moving
along<00:02:27.750> nicely<00:02:28.280> whereas<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.430> rest<00:02:29.460> are

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
along nicely whereas the rest are

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.330 
along nicely whereas the rest are
struggling<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.990> strong<00:02:31.350> dollar<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
struggling with this strong dollar the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.000 
struggling with this strong dollar the
strong<00:02:32.700> dollar<00:02:32.730> really<00:02:33.390> hurting<00:02:33.810> exports<00:02:34.140> all

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
strong dollar really hurting exports all

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.500 
strong dollar really hurting exports all
right<00:02:35.190> it's<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.460> shorter<00:02:35.760> trading<00:02:36.060> week<00:02:36.210> Frank

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
right it's a shorter trading week Frank

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.390 
right it's a shorter trading week Frank
but<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:37.170> are<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.350> seeing<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.950> touchdown

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
but what are you seeing as the touchdown

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.550 
but what are you seeing as the touchdown
pass<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:39.030> think<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.630> touchdown<00:02:40.080> pass<00:02:40.320> is

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
pass I think the touchdown pass is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.410 
pass I think the touchdown pass is
coming<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:41.010> Friday<00:02:41.430> we're<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.270> have<00:02:42.390> a
