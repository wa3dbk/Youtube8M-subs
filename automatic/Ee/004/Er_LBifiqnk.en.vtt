Xbox where you get enough kills as one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
Xbox where you get enough kills as one
of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> lower<00:01:14.010> class<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> be

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
of the lower class right to get to be

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
of the lower class right to get to be
one<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> main<00:01:16.229> characters<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.920> Lord<00:01:17.250> of
