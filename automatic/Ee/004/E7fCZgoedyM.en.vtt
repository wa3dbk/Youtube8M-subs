00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Welcome friends to your channel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.109
 technology to whom of us has not 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.200
 past that for any reason in 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.179
 Sometimes we need to create quickly 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 folders in any space of our 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.970
 pc good because today I will teach you how to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 do it with the keyboard works for 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 windows 8 and for windows 7 we start in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.170
 your keyboard we will press the following 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.019
 three keys at the same time control + 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.750
 shift + n with these three keys 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.750
 we will create folders faster 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.870
 I'm going to create three folders in the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.480
 desk now let's see if inside 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.670
 from a folder you can perform the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 same procedure let's see what happens 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.339
 as we can see if you can 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 how many times do we need to press 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.620
 these three keys and we will create folders 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.109
 fast to create one after another 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.259
 we must give enter to create each one 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.229
 if we do not give enter it will not allow us to create 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.060
 the next because windows we 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.430
 enable the space to put the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.979
 name the folder with enter it 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.189
 issued and place now by default 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.710
 same name always taught them another 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.560
 trick to be able to erase more 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 direct that is without having to go through 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.440
 the recycling bin we press 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.830
 these two keys at the same time shift + 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.780
 suppress see how I do it first 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.159
 we select and press the two 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.149
 mentioned keys 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.850
 Finally we enter and how we can 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.159
 appreciate what we eliminate no longer happens to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.830
 the recycling bin but it is 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.140
 permanently eliminates must from 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.450
 be careful since if you delete this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.520
 we can no longer recover what 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.240
 removed unless they use a 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.180
 program 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.210
 recover that it recovers from the hard disk the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.820
 deleted files good friends no 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.890
