you<00:00:01.860> see<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.220> structure<00:00:02.550> what<00:00:03.390> do<00:00:03.450> you<00:00:03.540> think

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
you see this structure what do you think

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.019 
you see this structure what do you think
it<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.800> course<00:00:05.069> it's<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.310> glass<00:00:05.490> structure

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
it is of course it's a glass structure

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.470 
it is of course it's a glass structure
and<00:00:06.269> you<00:00:07.140> can<00:00:07.290> see<00:00:07.439> small<00:00:07.710> plants<00:00:08.099> as<00:00:08.220> well<00:00:08.519> but

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
and you can see small plants as well but

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.839 
and you can see small plants as well but
there<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> specific<00:00:10.170> reason<00:00:10.740> why<00:00:11.219> that

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
there is a specific reason why that

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.209 
there is a specific reason why that
structure<00:00:12.210> exists<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:13.379> know<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.679> allows

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
structure exists you know it allows

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.900 
structure exists you know it allows
sunlight<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.660> enter<00:00:16.039> but<00:00:17.039> does<00:00:17.220> not<00:00:17.460> allow<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
sunlight to enter but does not allow the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.720 
sunlight to enter but does not allow the
heat<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> escape<00:00:18.560> let's<00:00:19.560> understand<00:00:20.130> what

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
heat to escape let's understand what

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.980 
heat to escape let's understand what
exactly<00:00:20.940> is<00:00:21.420> happening

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
exactly is happening

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.100 
exactly is happening
solar<00:00:22.830> radiation<00:00:23.180> can<00:00:24.180> easily<00:00:24.780> pass<00:00:25.080> through

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
solar radiation can easily pass through

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.280 
solar radiation can easily pass through
glass<00:00:25.620> now<00:00:26.610> what<00:00:26.730> happened<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.540> the

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
glass now what happened then is the

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.860 
glass now what happened then is the
ground<00:00:28.650> inside<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.280> glove<00:00:29.520> house<00:00:29.790> is<00:00:30.030> heated

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:30.870 
ground inside the glove house is heated

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.680 
ground inside the glove house is heated
up<00:00:31.110> when<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> ground<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.579> heated<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
up when this ground is heated it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.070 
up when this ground is heated it
radiates<00:00:34.310> thermal<00:00:35.310> infrared<00:00:35.550> radiation<00:00:36.330> now

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
radiates thermal infrared radiation now

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.500 
radiates thermal infrared radiation now
the<00:00:37.140> glass<00:00:37.410> material<00:00:38.040> does<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.790> allow<00:00:39.210> this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the glass material does not allow this

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.290 
the glass material does not allow this
radiation<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> pass<00:00:40.410> through<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> heat<00:00:42.060> is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
radiation to pass through so the heat is

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.360 
radiation to pass through so the heat is
trapped<00:00:42.810> inside<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.680> glass<00:00:43.860> house<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
trapped inside the glass house and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.120 
trapped inside the glass house and
because<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.240> that<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:46.320> temperature<00:00:46.920> inside

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
because of that the temperature inside

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.510 
because of that the temperature inside
the<00:00:47.610> Glass<00:00:48.000> House<00:00:48.270> Rises<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the Glass House Rises and there is a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
the Glass House Rises and there is a
name<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.790> these<00:00:51.180> glass<00:00:51.450> houses<00:00:51.720> I'm<00:00:52.079> sure

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
name for these glass houses I'm sure

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
name for these glass houses I'm sure
you're<00:00:53.040> aware<00:00:53.220> of<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.579> these<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.480> called

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you're aware of that these are called

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.350 
you're aware of that these are called
greenhouses<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.950> now<00:00:56.880> you<00:00:56.940> must<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.329> thinking

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
greenhouses and now you must be thinking

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.960 
greenhouses and now you must be thinking
about<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> greenhouse<00:00:58.230> effect<00:00:58.460> what<00:00:59.460> exactly

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
about the greenhouse effect what exactly

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.290 
about the greenhouse effect what exactly
is<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.380> sunlight<00:01:01.489> causes<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.030> earth

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
is that sunlight causes the earth

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.529 
is that sunlight causes the earth
surface<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.379> heat<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.670> now<00:01:05.670> earth<00:01:05.969> appears

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
surface to heat up now earth appears

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.139 
surface to heat up now earth appears
that<00:01:07.200> radiates<00:01:07.889> the<00:01:08.130> thermal<00:01:08.939> infrared

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
that radiates the thermal infrared

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.809 
that radiates the thermal infrared
radiation<00:01:10.079> that<00:01:10.109> I<00:01:10.350> was<00:01:10.499> talking<00:01:10.770> about<00:01:10.829> now

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
radiation that I was talking about now

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.580 
radiation that I was talking about now
there<00:01:11.999> are<00:01:12.119> gases<00:01:12.389> in<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:12.840> atmosphere<00:01:12.869> like

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
there are gases in the atmosphere like

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
there are gases in the atmosphere like
carbon<00:01:13.950> dioxide<00:01:14.600> nitrogen<00:01:15.600> oxide<00:01:16.049> water

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
carbon dioxide nitrogen oxide water

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.239 
carbon dioxide nitrogen oxide water
vapor<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.789> together<00:01:18.079> ensure<00:01:19.079> that<00:01:20.069> this

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
vapor they together ensure that this

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.730 
vapor they together ensure that this
infrared<00:01:20.850> radiation<00:01:21.539> is<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:22.259> allowed<00:01:22.709> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
infrared radiation is not allowed to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.279 
infrared radiation is not allowed to
leave<00:01:22.889> that<00:01:23.219> most<00:01:23.429> fear<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.969> because<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
leave that most fear and because of a

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.169 
leave that most fear and because of a
number<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.770> human<00:01:26.039> activities<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.789> you<00:01:27.060> would

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
number of human activities as you would

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.779 
number of human activities as you would
know<00:01:27.389> the<00:01:27.959> amount<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.560> carbon<00:01:29.039> dioxide<00:01:29.069> in<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
know the amount of carbon dioxide in the

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.419 
know the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.539> continuously<00:01:31.200> increasing

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
atmosphere is continuously increasing

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.609 
atmosphere is continuously increasing
and<00:01:32.429> because<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.789> that<00:01:32.929> more<00:01:33.929> and<00:01:34.109> more<00:01:34.289> heat

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and because of that more and more heat

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.879 
and because of that more and more heat
gets<00:01:34.950> trapped<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:35.670> atmosphere<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.569> that

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
gets trapped in the atmosphere and that

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:40.730 
gets trapped in the atmosphere and that
mas<00:01:37.889> malok<00:01:38.130> temperature<00:01:38.939> goes<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.869> has<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
mas malok temperature goes up has it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.309 
mas malok temperature goes up has it
been<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.399> lately<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> greenhouse

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
been going up lately so the greenhouse

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.429 
been going up lately so the greenhouse
effect<00:01:43.529> is<00:01:44.279> causing<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.389> earth<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> slowly

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
effect is causing the earth to slowly

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.699 
effect is causing the earth to slowly
get<00:01:46.740> warmer<00:01:47.249> and<00:01:47.599> this<00:01:48.599> is<00:01:48.840> precisely<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
get warmer and this is precisely the

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.919 
get warmer and this is precisely the
phenomenon<00:01:50.279> which<00:01:50.969> is<00:01:50.999> commonly<00:01:51.539> known<00:01:51.599> as

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
phenomenon which is commonly known as
