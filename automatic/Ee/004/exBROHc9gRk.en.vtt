00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.229 
cream on there and before I have a flat
on<00:03:52.090> my<00:03:52.269> hair<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:53.049> definitely<00:03:53.889> was<00:03:54.069> more<00:03:54.459> just

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.610 
on my hair it definitely was more just
smooth<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.349> felt<00:03:56.680> like<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.950> would

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
smooth and it felt like you would

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.830 
smooth and it felt like you would
straighten<00:03:58.069> better<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.150> once<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.629> actually
