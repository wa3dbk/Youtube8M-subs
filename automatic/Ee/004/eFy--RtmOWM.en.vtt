dollars<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> whole<00:00:53.460> bolt<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.379> of

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
dollars for the whole bolt so I of

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.650 
dollars for the whole bolt so I of
course<00:00:55.590> bought<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:57.030> hadn't<00:00:57.360> used<00:00:57.480> it
