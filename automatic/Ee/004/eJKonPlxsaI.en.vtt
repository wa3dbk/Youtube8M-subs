into<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> pump<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> could<00:00:45.110> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
into the pump this is what I could the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
into the pump this is what I could the
connector<00:00:46.680> off<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.530> ballcock<00:00:50.489> valve<00:00:50.789> for

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
connector off is this ballcock valve for

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.319 
connector off is this ballcock valve for
a<00:00:51.480> toilet<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:53.210> took<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
a toilet I just took that off there and

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.020 
a toilet I just took that off there and
connect<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:58.430> into<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> bottom<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.850> there

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
connect to this into the bottom of there

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.229 
connect to this into the bottom of there
that's<00:01:00.989> how<00:01:01.230> easy<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.770> when<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.879> running

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that's how easy it is when it's running

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.550 
that's how easy it is when it's running
I've<00:01:03.600> got<00:01:03.840> filter<00:01:06.290> pop<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:09.650> there<00:01:10.650> just

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
I've got filter pop that in there just

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
I've got filter pop that in there just
have<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.799> end<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.549> sort<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.850> water<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
have that end just sort of water this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469 
have that end just sort of water this
trickling<00:01:16.560> into<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.130> which<00:01:17.700> makes<00:01:18.000> us<00:01:18.210> well

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
trickling into there which makes us well

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
trickling into there which makes us well
and<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.799> pump<00:01:20.040> foot<00:01:20.490> pulls<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> through<00:01:22.130> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and the pump foot pulls it through this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.310 
and the pump foot pulls it through this
is<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> pump<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.820> use<00:01:25.400> actually<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> water

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
is the pump I use actually in the water

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.539 
is the pump I use actually in the water
doing<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> bit<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> waterfall<00:01:29.189> at<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
doing with a bit of a waterfall at the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:44.990 
doing with a bit of a waterfall at the
minute<00:01:30.710> that's<00:01:37.159> just<00:01:39.020> Moxie<00:01:40.020> Jeff<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.820> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
minute that's just Moxie Jeff and that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.240 
minute that's just Moxie Jeff and that
runs<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.920> fantastic

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.670 

so<00:01:50.060> like<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.240> see<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.630> I've<00:01:50.870> just<00:01:50.900> connects<00:01:51.410> to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
so like I see it I've just connects to

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.700 
so like I see it I've just connects to
the<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.910> skimmer<00:01:57.970> I'm<00:01:58.970> just<00:01:59.210> quickly<00:01:59.710> enough

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the the skimmer I'm just quickly enough

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.410 
the the skimmer I'm just quickly enough
which<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.160> needs<00:02:01.310> put<00:02:01.640> them<00:02:01.760> in<00:02:01.880> because<00:02:02.060> of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
which it needs put them in because of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.100 
which it needs put them in because of
the<00:02:02.570> stuff<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.170> top<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.530> pond<00:02:03.830> already

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
the stuff on the top of the pond already

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.030 
the stuff on the top of the pond already
goes<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.730> like<00:02:07.730> that<00:02:08.229> he<00:02:09.229> screws<00:02:09.560> onto<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
goes in like that he screws onto the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.490 
goes in like that he screws onto the
side<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.430> me<00:02:10.550> pond<00:02:10.990> what<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.170> just<00:02:12.350> floods<00:02:12.620> in

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
