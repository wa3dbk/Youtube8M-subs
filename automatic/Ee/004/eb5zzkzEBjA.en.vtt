00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:22.160
 they are criminals and I will say little 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:28.210
 I was in order to indicate that the care and 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.800
 the order mam to the local police 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.670
 I am clear and today I am going to teach you 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.289
 make a capo so in third 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.289
 any league 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.820
 pencil or pen of any type 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.830
 can you do let's place our 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.630
 pen on the fret that we wish I would 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.000
 I will place on the first fret 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.440
 let's try to make this part stay 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 as prepared as possible that is not 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.710
 so I explain myself 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.710
 and we are going to take our league 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.430
 of our guitar 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:27.060
 what to do is the riots up 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 and this is very out then so what 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.380
 what is going to happen is that it will cost us 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.760
 a lot of work to turn around for that is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.130
 what he is trying to explain is that 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.049
 it has to be as low as possible 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.380
 to go around to add repression and 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.659
 that does not sound like that after a few 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.939
 how many turns on the sides of the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.909
 this pen should already sound and ok no 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.610
 will sound the same as a conventional capo 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.310
 but it serves at the moment in which 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.539
 we wanted a song a capo and not 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.539
 let's have one of these 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.650
 Y 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.650
 this has been all 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.270
 and help people who do not have fields 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.510
 because they are too lazy to work and 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.700
 buy insurance like me so up 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.490

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.800
 share you know how to like it 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.960
