00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.280
 Hi everybody 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.780
 today I'm coming back with a little 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 waterproof make-up 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.120
 how is it not like that? 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.430
 if then set aside for days 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.140
 since the make up waterproof has its 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
 importance for those who like it 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.880
 go to the beach with a little bit of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.230
 makeup then the interest on the shot 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.699
 actually when we tell people that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 we wear makeup to go to the beach they 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.570
 look with round eyes like 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 balloons kind the girl she goes to the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.620
 beach and make up bah yes yes because 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.960
 that sometimes I go to the beach and then 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 as far as I want to feel 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 like every day so with a little 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.070
 focus on the eyes a not complexion 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 necessarily blafard although after 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.670
 a few days of beach logically that 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.950
 does not happen anymore and then and then the other 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170
 reason it can be that right after we 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.120
 may want to go out and make up 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.510
 waterproof will allow you to go to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 the beach 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 makeup and shower you 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.379
 change but do not go through the box 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.059
 make-up before going into a small 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.020
 resto have a little evening between 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.970
 buddies and what is very important that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 is going to be putting a protection on his 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 face because who says makeup 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.939
 waterproof says sun to do that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.560
 I use my bb cream from maybelline 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.810
 because it's the one I used 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 last year and that I honestly 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.290
 been very happy with the result being 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.509
 given that I did not take a single shot 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.700
 on the face at the same time 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.920
 must admit that I'm going to sun only 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.119
 when I go in the water otherwise the rest 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.890
 of time I tend to be 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.659
 under the parasol so it helps but 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.619
 nevertheless I think she still 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.619
 not bad job 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.840
 this 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.090
 to start what I sought to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.400
 make waterproof on my face it's 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.530
 mainly the eyes because that's 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.820
 true that if I want to do 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.010
 bring out something in particular 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.990
 on me it goes mainly to the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.360
 level of look to do that I'm going 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.890
 take my indispensable the best 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.780
 products that I know on the subject 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.700
 even if we have quite a few others, these are 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.070
 the aqua cream of make up for ever 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.900
 so these little things actually they 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.119
 have an impeccable hold 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.860
 they are really really waterproof 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.110
 I did the tests I do them 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.910
 last I have pictures where I come out 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.770
 to house exactly the same make up 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.720
 that before you say ah you come back so is 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.400
 really it's safe values you 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.190
 can go there with your eyes closed 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.380
 worry the other indispensable is the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.110
 waterproof mascara so here it is about 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.360
 the extreme of LancÃ´me and nothing better to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.790
 really give intensity to the gaze 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.910
 than beautiful six months but without the effect 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.910
 panda 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400
 good 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.540
 so that's for the eyes then in this 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.510
 concerning the complexion there is aqua 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.150
 cream that have colors that are ideal for 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.500
 the cheeks or the lips so me on the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.780
 lips I quickly because as I 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.980
 students always archi dry that's it 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.409
 really products that go out 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.129
 drying out more against 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.129
 cheeks it's not bad 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.829
 so we do not hesitate once 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.440
 applied to come rub a little bit 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:28.169
 from above to float well 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.370
 color with complexion for the lips being 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.660
 given that I really wish to kept 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.310
 focus on the look 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.470
 I will take a color rather 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.270
 neutral and here it comes to jesse witten 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.280
 who knows ball in warm hues and 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.470
 sweet those with a home 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.720
 revlon and actually like pigmentation 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.729
 is really excellent this kind of 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.259
 produced a few hours later there will be 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.000
 always a certain intensity at 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.380
 level of color that makes that same 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.030
 if it's not water proof it's when 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:59.610
 even long enough for that 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:05:01.949
 it shows and then there is a 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.259
 optional product that is for the 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.960
 eyebrows it's a kit make up for ever 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.270
 so in gel and that is totally or 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.560
 also waterproof so this product 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.449
 to use it you simply have to 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.440
 put a little bit on his hand 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:23.940
 and with the brush made for this purpose 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:36.150
 a bunch of mates and we just fill the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:37.530
 line of eyebrows with lightness and like 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.570
 all eyebrow makeup 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.580
 I spend my little bottle for good 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.440
 football and the material so I liked when 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.970
 even a little flat on this product for 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.729
 the eyebrows because it is waterproof 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.070
 but not necessarily dress up what 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.199
 means that if when you come out of 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.210
 water you tend to rub yourself 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.620
 the eyes it is possible that you in 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.030
 make a little bit of a trip 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.289
 because here at the same time 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.759
 waterproof makeup one is not supposed 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.699
 no longer take the towel and 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.970
 to wipe with so be careful when 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.159
 even 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.139
