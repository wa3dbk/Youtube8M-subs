00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.530 

here<00:00:11.770> we<00:00:11.950> have<00:00:12.160> a<00:00:12.190> device<00:00:12.550> that<00:00:12.580> I<00:00:12.970> purchased

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
here we have a device that I purchased

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.640 
here we have a device that I purchased
separately<00:00:14.380> from<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.400> hydrogen<00:00:15.910> system<00:00:16.650> it's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
separately from the hydrogen system it's

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.310 
separately from the hydrogen system it's
called<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.100> electronic<00:00:18.760> fuel<00:00:19.029> injection

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
called the electronic fuel injection

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.600 
called the electronic fuel injection
enhancer<00:00:20.320> or<00:00:20.580> effets<00:00:21.610> for<00:00:22.090> short<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:24.250> I<00:00:24.279> got

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
enhancer or effets for short now I got

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.920 
enhancer or effets for short now I got
this<00:00:24.880> because<00:00:25.320> my<00:00:26.320> car<00:00:26.619> being<00:00:27.040> fuel-injected

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
this because my car being fuel-injected

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.760 
this because my car being fuel-injected
has<00:00:28.930> an<00:00:29.410> oxygen<00:00:29.980> sensor<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:31.290> the<00:00:32.290> oxygen

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
has an oxygen sensor and the oxygen

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.030 
has an oxygen sensor and the oxygen
sensors<00:00:33.220> job<00:00:33.490> is<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.230> relay<00:00:35.230> information<00:00:35.470> to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
sensors job is to relay information to

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.729 
sensors job is to relay information to
the<00:00:36.370> cars<00:00:37.000> computer<00:00:37.540> about<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.380> oxygen

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
the cars computer about the oxygen

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.460 
the cars computer about the oxygen
content<00:00:39.130> of<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.850> exhaust<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.870> narrowband

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
content of the exhaust the narrowband

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.130 
content of the exhaust the narrowband
oxygen<00:00:45.100> sensor<00:00:45.580> sends<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:46.060> low-voltage<00:00:46.450> signal

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
oxygen sensor sends a low-voltage signal

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.850 
oxygen sensor sends a low-voltage signal
to<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.410> ECM<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.780> voltage<00:00:50.200> range<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.710> around

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
to the ECM the voltage range is around

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.950 
to the ECM the voltage range is around
twenty<00:00:51.730> point<00:00:52.000> nine<00:00:52.210> volts<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.810> under<00:00:58.810> all

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
twenty point nine volts and under all

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.370 
twenty point nine volts and under all
conditions<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:01.210> computer<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:01.930> going<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.230> try

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
conditions the computer is going to try

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.560 
conditions the computer is going to try
to<00:01:02.440> maintain<00:01:02.710> fourteen<00:01:03.610> point<00:01:03.910> seven<00:01:04.330> two<00:01:04.540> one

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
to maintain fourteen point seven two one

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.270 
to maintain fourteen point seven two one
air<00:01:05.560> fuel<00:01:05.920> ratio<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.080> if<00:01:08.350> we<00:01:08.560> introduce<00:01:09.040> more

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
air fuel ratio so if we introduce more

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.270 
air fuel ratio so if we introduce more
oxygen<00:01:09.340> into<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.450> system<00:01:10.869> which<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.619> what<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
oxygen into the system which is what the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.849 
oxygen into the system which is what the
hydrogen<00:01:12.729> generator<00:01:13.119> is<00:01:13.390> going<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.749> do<00:01:13.899> by

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
hydrogen generator is going to do by

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.190 
hydrogen generator is going to do by
making<00:01:15.609> the<00:01:15.700> gasoline<00:01:16.270> burn<00:01:16.780> more<00:01:17.049> completely

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
making the gasoline burn more completely

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.529 
making the gasoline burn more completely
so<00:01:18.070> there<00:01:18.219> will<00:01:18.280> be<00:01:18.340> more<00:01:18.729> oxygen<00:01:19.329> in<00:01:19.420> the

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
so there will be more oxygen in the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.719 
so there will be more oxygen in the
exhaust<00:01:19.649> less<00:01:20.649> hydrocarbons<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.609> less

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
exhaust less hydrocarbons and less

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.830 
exhaust less hydrocarbons and less
emissions<00:01:22.649> under<00:01:23.649> that<00:01:23.770> circumstance<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
emissions under that circumstance the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.020 
emissions under that circumstance the
computer<00:01:26.319> is<00:01:26.530> going<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.890> think<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
computer is going to think that the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.899 
computer is going to think that the
engine<00:01:28.329> is<00:01:28.450> running<00:01:28.479> lean<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.909> therefore

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
engine is running lean and therefore

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.809 
engine is running lean and therefore
it's<00:01:31.179> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.509> put<00:01:32.049> more<00:01:32.499> gasoline<00:01:33.100> into<00:01:33.700> the

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
it's going to put more gasoline into the

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.109 
it's going to put more gasoline into the
engine<00:01:34.149> which<00:01:34.840> will<00:01:34.990> actually<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:36.460> in<00:01:36.640> reverse

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
engine which will actually go in reverse

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.969 
engine which will actually go in reverse
of<00:01:37.630> what<00:01:37.810> we're<00:01:37.990> trying<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.350> do<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:41.799> this

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
of what we're trying to do so I got this

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.580 
of what we're trying to do so I got this
device<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.759> what<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.600> does<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.139> it<00:01:44.350> actually

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
device and what it does is it actually

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.879 
device and what it does is it actually
lies<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.999> the<00:01:46.119> computer<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.869> makes<00:01:47.740> the

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
lies to the computer it makes the

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.819 
lies to the computer it makes the
computer<00:01:48.189> think<00:01:48.609> that<00:01:48.759> we're<00:01:48.880> burning<00:01:49.270> rich

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
computer think that we're burning rich

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.279 
computer think that we're burning rich
therefore<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.909> computer<00:01:52.359> backs<00:01:52.659> off<00:01:52.929> the

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
therefore the computer backs off the

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.099 
therefore the computer backs off the
fuel<00:01:53.560> injectors<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.249> less<00:01:54.850> gasoline<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.659> put

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
fuel injectors and less gasoline is put

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.649 
fuel injectors and less gasoline is put
into<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.799> engine

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
into the engine

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.419 
into the engine
this<00:01:58.659> device<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.380> simple<00:02:00.009> it's<00:02:00.159> just<00:02:00.219> a

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
this device is simple it's just a

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.690 
this device is simple it's just a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
from parts like from RadioShack or any

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.430 
from parts like from RadioShack or any
electronic<00:02:24.100> supplier<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.870> explains<00:02:26.260> how

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
electronic supplier and it explains how

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.500 
electronic supplier and it explains how
oxygen<00:02:26.920> sensors<00:02:27.340> work<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.090> really<00:02:28.330> good

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
oxygen sensors work it's a really good

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.650 
oxygen sensors work it's a really good
book<00:02:28.750> I'm<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.830> try<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.100> generator<00:02:30.660> yeah

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
book I'm going to try the generator yeah

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.320 
book I'm going to try the generator yeah
with<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.590> effets<00:02:33.160> turned<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.090> off<00:02:34.300> just

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
with this effets turned on and off just

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.220 
with this effets turned on and off just
to<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:35.340> what<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.550> outcome<00:02:36.970> actually<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.720> but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
to see what the outcome actually is but

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.070 
to see what the outcome actually is but
theoretically<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:40.240> should<00:02:40.300> make<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.720> big

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
theoretically this should make a big
