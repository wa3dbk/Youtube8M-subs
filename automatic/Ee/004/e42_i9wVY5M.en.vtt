00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.169 
lessons with a couple kids after school
I've<00:02:01.469> done<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.919> in<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> past<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.939> think

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
I've done that in the past I think

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.379 
I've done that in the past I think
there's<00:02:04.249> you<00:02:05.249> don't<00:02:05.279> need<00:02:05.669> an<00:02:05.759> art<00:02:05.939> degree<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
there's you don't need an art degree to

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.359 
there's you don't need an art degree to
teach<00:02:06.419> and<00:02:06.959> you<00:02:07.499> don't<00:02:07.770> need<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> graphic

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
teach and you don't need a graphic

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
teach and you don't need a graphic
design<00:02:08.580> degree<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.880> do<00:02:08.970> graphics<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.569> think

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
design degree to do graphics I think

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
design degree to do graphics I think
that<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.739> days<00:02:11.009> anyone<00:02:12.050> why's<00:02:13.050> everyone

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that these days anyone why's everyone

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.690 
that these days anyone why's everyone
considers<00:02:13.890> themselves<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.310> graphic<00:02:14.670> designer

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
considers themselves a graphic designer

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.440 
considers themselves a graphic designer
I<00:02:15.300> don't<00:02:15.930> know<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.410> that's<00:02:16.650> good<00:02:17.240> but<00:02:18.240> you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
I don't know if that's good but you

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
I don't know if that's good but you
don't<00:02:18.750> necessarily<00:02:18.870> need<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.650> degree

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
