00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.660
 while the interface of the phone there we are dealing anyway we stay 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.019
 of palm the king must s 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.089
 to say that we were really seduced by its interface which is 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.419
 really very very good 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.179
 very nice m health neither too full but not enough 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.950
 it's in the church like nokia 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.400
 in his studies 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.669
 we report estaires 1-1 the direct opposite 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.720
 but what about going through a draw 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720
 it is classic enough to access acer applications 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.240
 despite everything quite formal and 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.610
 to this list 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.040
 ap on the palm side by cons there right now it's really different 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.310
 dudley at first we have our bar 2 the fast kidal shortcut 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.760
 with us 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.210
 or rather on the screen we can lead them 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 % the main lever so the smile 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.900
 fast enough 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.910
 it is still quite responsive we have a Texas Instruments processor ti de 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.150
 600 billion 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.190
 to heal the instructions in fact it's slightly more optimized 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 tulle what we can find also in our phone with him 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280
 certainly 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.620
 percent of seated press points and it's worth not take place either 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 experience 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.410
 the changes a new coliseum for now it's followed by six hours 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.720
 to find in front of thousands of his farms 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.350
 europorte france make the state three years ago it was rare for me so it's 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.200
 especially his anguish 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.580
 all taxis obviously planned for 20% - 2 who acquired 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.750
 is active but works as a help bait as if he had a 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.400
 keyboard 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.830
 yet in a few places like the man of the low-skilled people 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.760
 by hand 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.580
 e as much we realize 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.850
 very quickly worship 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.070
 if a keyboard will work the same way 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.620
 the only woman that's really much more intuitive have composed the case for 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.680
 Nothing 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.350
 so you get involved with direct mistakes knowing that we have seen 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.630
 these people here 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 who is invisible but who exists 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 I did that she is active and we look at the principles 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.750
 while most of the controls are actually part of this little 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.280
 zoom called the gesture area 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.150
 so he had several things 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.159
 first in auvergne 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.289
 it will not serve anymore 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.739
 also in applications 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.629
 Senegalese are 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.629
 to put them in the background this way 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.529
 this is it to go back a selection for example funds 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:26.589
 screen 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.209
 I will return to Iran 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.059
 I'm doing a little backward pull 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.229
 to come back 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.819
 you must know that the problem 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.870
 for 100 m while he was totally the internship and especially planned 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.639
 for one year 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.029
 that is, you can then have a lot of applications at once 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.929
 he will have no problem he can always 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.909
 so he is not a parent 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.919
 background 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.079
 and the agency 5 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.300
 but politically 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.560
 no difficulty down applications without strap fast enough 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.569
 he's also having a life a little wider than his art of moving the 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.989
 applications between them and interact will accept it 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.989
 we can also launch and messaging 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.009
 Internet 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.009
 we will come back in more detail about each of these lives 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.729
 on each series 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.589
 from here the application near 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.589
 the camera 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.759
 you can go up to 50 years that way 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.159
 reims up to 5 years which has been guaranteed 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.649
 we even have a reader 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.409
 ultimedia was obviously 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.089
 music 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.759
 what m in the hands of god the match having distributed who drew pct 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.099
 Kurdish party specified the ofj specified 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.669
 beyond her slender figure we do not understand that this is much 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.679
 applications ready for this mom 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.129
 it's not okay it's just the cashier 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.229
 long enough 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.229
 yes and no because there is a sacred package erika sensible 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.979
 and it continues reaching the quarters so not to the taste of science 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.079
 we also remember other applications 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.889
 videos for example 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.889
 lula relied on a second time you'll see it pretty quickly 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.589
 we can talk we can not really% 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:16.109
 this one used a good thing to protect the throws 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.720
 the pilot 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.819
 two belgians the private here 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.289
 he knows perfectly the gps inside and one of the highest 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:26.900
 after the indications that is discharging since 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.379
 the catalonia we are going to launch 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.490
 which is a form of apple store in the country in both 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.689
 marquette 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.809
 what I find very well do it still resumes 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.509
 woerth a little juice 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.789
 the duo and marquette and in india applications that 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.139
 which are shared 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.139
 a little 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.129
 but more facebook teaching 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.110
 dedicated application 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.110
 note that faith hill hospital is totally integrated 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.889
 in the repertoire 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.800
 do not you see there is still a lot of applications 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.189
 any reader 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.189
 and all that on this continent 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.469
 he adds also launched it does not pose him any concern 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.809
 I even launch a video game 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.460
 which visibly puts him once again 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.460
 no problem 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.830
 at the break 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.620
 we will be able to launch 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.289
 also 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.289
 in the study 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.740
 the creator for now 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.319
 easily 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.409
 to a dozen open applications - European one of them 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.259
 3 4 this is how it is an elite 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.800
 9,611 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.180
 12 13 14 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.809
 15 16 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.830
 disputed over these two ages and the ECB 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.529
 and as you can see 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.469
 the activity still in mourning
