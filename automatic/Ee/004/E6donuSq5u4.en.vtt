00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.970
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.120
 learn to make a paper fish 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.910
 like this one here is a very figure 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.460
 simple with a great result that 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.780
 we need a square folio that's what 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.830
 what we need to start our 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:21.380
 figure I already have here one prepared 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.970
 we started by marking the diagonal 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.370
 for this we take a corner on the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.780
 other 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.780
 and we leave the folio like this 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.410
 We will take 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.410
 this point on this one 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.870
 we double 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.820
 A) Yes 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.820
 two 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.700
 and we mark well 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.040
 well we should have something like this 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.760
 now let's do a fold of 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.199
 reference 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.010
 we are going to take this line on this 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.340
 here 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 and we mark vale is simply a 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.479
 reference fold 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.880
 we do it this way 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.790
 and we unfolded 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.790
 I just want this point here 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.690
 This is the point that interests me because 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.530
 Now I'm going to take this little corner 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.130
 so that this side is on top 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.470
 of this but remember the fold that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.950
 we mark the point that interests me is 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:43.080
 you have to mark it well and now I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.120
 I guide by the double so here 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.480
 and crushed 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.690
 ok just repeat this point is 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.080
 a reference for now upload this 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.390
 little corner here 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.600
 we turn the figure 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.980
 and this little corner we take as your 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.580
 partner we put it at the same height 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.580
 A) Yes 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.540
 perfect very well now what are we going to 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.180
 to do is to look at this here and more 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.760
 or less 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.340
 study where is the midpoint I 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.180
 I think it will be here we are going to take 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.800
 this and attention more or less for the point 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.740
 means that it's going to be over here 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.990
 we go down like this so that this line 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.990
 is perpendicular to the base 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.230
 well and more or less by the midpoint 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.140
 and we crush I flip the folio 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.150
 and I repeat the same but as I already have 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.319
 it is as a reference simply under 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.689
 until they are at the same height 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.689
 well and crushed 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.310
 very good now what we are going to do is 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.870
 open here 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.370
 and bend attention in such a way that this 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.370
 I'll take it up here 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.790
 A) Yes 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.970
 and the same from behind 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.870
 double 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.440
 and I should have something like that you see how this 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.950
 it looks like a fish 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.700
 we have here the fins the head the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.000
 back side 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.890
 now what is going now 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.780
 to do is another fold more 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.290
 what's going to come out of here we're going to make a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.319
 line that go here here once again 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.319
 approximate can be here here and here 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.280
 let's see something 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.890
 well more or less 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.060
 for example and unfolded is a fold of 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.630
 reference 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.690
 more or less this if we do it if 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.320
 we do this double instead of like this in 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.210
 This is how we are going to stay 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.430
 these fins then bigger more 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.290
 small also with the folds that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.790
 we did before if we doubled a little more 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.990
 up a little bit lower because you're 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.850
 fins that were bigger and more 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.470
 small as soon as we make a couple of 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.480
 times of this figure we control this 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.090
 perfectly and we already do it as 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.640
 We were fine with the help of 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.420
 the fold that we have made I open the figure 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.670
 in the middle like this 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.670
 and turned inside 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.530
 A) Yes 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.760
 perfect 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:06.650
 well now if you look here there are two 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.590
 parts 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.590
 so I 'm lame this one here 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.060
 and there were 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.220
 at the same time that I give it shape 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.840
 I raise it up to turn it into this figure 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.200
 I can manipulate, I can take it out 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.310
 little bit more take it out a little bit less 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.910
 in this way I get this from here 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.790
 OK 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.910
 I repeat 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.460
 I was here I got her up I'm going 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.260
 giving a little bit of shape like this 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.000
 crushed and you're done 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.430
 very well we already have practically the 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.380
 figure finished now this fish is a 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.750
 little bit fat we are going to hide paper 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.870
 for this I'm going to do a fold that 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.860
 leave here from this point and go through 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.860
 here just below the aleti already here 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.110
 it's worth a fold here 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.220
 open the figure a little 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:15.250
 and I'm going to get a fold so I'm 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.080
 dubbing him to come here around here 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.950
 here pass just below the fin 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.550
 A) Yes 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.910
 and method all this in here what 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.910
 I hide 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:33.289
 perfect and I do the same with the other 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:37.789
 part so that the figure is symmetrical 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:39.649
 so I take double right here 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.680
 below and I'm going to bend until I get to 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:44.370
 this end from here to this case 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.590
 A) Yes 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.720
 crushed I close the figure well 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.180
 and look like it looks like a fish 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.620
 you have here you are contacting this through 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.700
 here 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.750
 okay sing a couple of details 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:05.320
 let's hide this paper because it has 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.970
 a head a bit aggressive I will do 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:12.639
 a double reference will bring this 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:15.449
 little corner at this point here I fold like this 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.449
 crushed 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.610
 and I already have the double reference now 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:24.319
 I open my head 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.319
 and I double this for 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.169
 trying to be more or less the same 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.870
 in your parts 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:33.490
 and we have something like that now for the fish 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.939
 do not be too aggressive I will hide 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:41.370
 these corners a little bit like that 

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:41.370
 example and the same for the other side 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.139
 that's more or less it does not matter either 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:51.690
 and we would have our figure finished 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:54.300
 You see it's very simple that you have a 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.940
 pair of steps in which the folds are 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.710
 approximate and according to how we do them 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.419
 fins are going to be more or less 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.030
 big does not have much problem 

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:06.120
 we practice a few times and more 

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:08.370
 or less we know where to fold to have 

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.380
 the size that we want, I hope 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:14.060
 that you liked the video and see you 

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.060
 in another until later
