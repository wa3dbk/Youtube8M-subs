son<00:00:39.000> card<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.140> sounds<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:40.680> well<00:00:41.570> it's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
son card that sounds pretty well it's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.900 
son card that sounds pretty well it's
not<00:00:42.780> even<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> master<00:00:43.559> mechanic<00:00:43.710> car<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.520> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
not even the master mechanic car and is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.060 
not even the master mechanic car and is
the<00:00:45.149> best<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.570> farming<00:00:48.530> for<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> gold<00:00:49.800> coins

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070

the best for farming for the gold coins
of<00:00:50.280> course<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.230> sells<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.800> thirty-two

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
of course so it sells for thirty-two

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
of course so it sells for thirty-two
thousand<00:00:53.789> gold<00:00:53.910> coins<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.870> about<00:00:55.199> well

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
thousand gold coins and it's about well

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.840 
thousand gold coins and it's about well
it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> only<00:00:56.520> thing<00:00:57.289> before<00:00:58.289> level<00:00:58.710> 15<00:00:59.340> so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it is only thing before level 15 so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.260 
it is only thing before level 15 so
that's<00:01:00.239> pretty<00:01:00.420> cool<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:03.059> the

master<00:01:10.770> mechanic<00:01:11.189> arts<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.090> leads<00:01:12.299> us

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
master mechanic arts and this leads us

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
master mechanic arts and this leads us
to<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.780> X<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.229> our<00:01:16.619> concept<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> yeah<00:01:22.640> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to the X and our concept so yeah this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.819 
to the X and our concept so yeah this
column<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.670> second<00:01:27.360> best<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.170> panic<00:01:28.590> in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
column is the second best of panic in

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
column is the second best of panic in
the<00:01:28.860> game<00:01:29.479> because<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:32.159> sounds<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the game because it sounds for a lot it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
the game because it sounds for a lot it
uses<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.130> lot<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.850> paths<00:01:36.360> than<00:01:36.780> El<00:01:37.320> Dorado

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
uses a lot more of paths than El Dorado

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.960 
uses a lot more of paths than El Dorado
but<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:40.049> has<00:01:40.350> better<00:01:40.619> pay<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.130> much<00:01:41.729> better

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but it has better pay out much better

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.690 
but it has better pay out much better

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
for parts and instantly get it so it has

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.070 
for parts and instantly get it so it has
little<00:02:59.800> hide<00:03:00.130> members<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.800> spiti<00:03:02.800> awesome<00:03:04.080> he

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
probably the easiest way to get the

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.779 
probably the easiest way to get the
function<00:05:46.889> and<00:05:47.100> cut<00:05:47.729> down<00:05:47.760> so<00:05:49.160> fast<00:05:50.160> useful

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
function and cut down so fast useful

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.270 
function and cut down so fast useful
i'll<00:05:51.330> be<00:05:51.690> doing<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:51.930> lot<00:05:52.080> more<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:53.039> it<00:05:53.160> was
