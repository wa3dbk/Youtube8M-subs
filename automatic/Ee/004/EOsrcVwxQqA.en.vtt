Indians and Pakistanis who knew me and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.069 
Indians and Pakistanis who knew me and
at<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.680> point<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> time<00:01:41.009> being<00:01:41.640> stalled<00:01:42.150> so

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
at that point of time being stalled so

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
at that point of time being stalled so
to<00:01:43.140> say<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> couple<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> hours<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.880> little

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
to say for a couple of hours was little

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.370 
to say for a couple of hours was little
irritating<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.899> had<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> reach

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
irritating because I had to reach

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.389 
irritating because I had to reach
somewhere<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:46.979> missing<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
somewhere and I was missing that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.730 
somewhere and I was missing that
appointment<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> moment<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.500> thought

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
appointment and for a moment I thought

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.730 
appointment and for a moment I thought
it's<00:01:50.670> unnecessary<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> realized<00:01:52.500> now

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's unnecessary and then I realized now

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.760 
it's unnecessary and then I realized now
when<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> maybe<00:01:54.770> having

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
when I think about it that maybe having

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
when I think about it that maybe having
known<00:01:55.979> me<00:01:56.159> taking<00:01:56.820> pictures<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.270> me<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
known me taking pictures with me and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.810 
known me taking pictures with me and
doing<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> autographs<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
doing the autographs I think the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.219 
doing the autographs I think the
superiors<00:02:00.299> had<00:02:00.450> told<00:02:00.630> them<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.960> clearly

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
superiors had told them very clearly

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.499 
superiors had told them very clearly
listen<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.130> process<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> process<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.479> should

listen a process is a process we should

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.999 
listen a process is a process we should

not give up the process because this

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
not give up the process because this
