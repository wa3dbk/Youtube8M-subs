me the incentive that we could build a

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.210 
me the incentive that we could build a
peripheral<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.750> would<00:02:30.590> respond<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.129> your

peripheral that would respond to your

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.460 
peripheral that would respond to your
motion<00:02:31.579> but<00:02:31.790> also<00:02:32.090> would<00:02:32.360> be<00:02:32.590> accessible<00:02:35.470> but

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
motion but also would be accessible but

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.050 
motion but also would be accessible but
shouldn't<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:36.920> be<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.099> challenge<00:02:37.489> for<00:02:37.939> an

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
shouldn't it be the challenge for an

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.940 
shouldn't it be the challenge for an
ambassador<00:02:38.629> like<00:02:38.810> Tony<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:39.319> get<00:02:39.439> the<00:02:39.590> kids<00:02:39.739> out

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.220 
ambassador like Tony to get the kids out
on<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.340> streets<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.940> skating<00:02:41.569> for<00:02:41.750> real<00:02:41.959> I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
on the streets and skating for real I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.080 
on the streets and skating for real I
think<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.069> can<00:02:43.190> have<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.370> healthy<00:02:43.519> balance<00:02:43.970> of

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
think you can have a healthy balance of

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.849 
think you can have a healthy balance of
both<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.810> know<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.930> never<00:02:45.049> want<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> discourage

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
both you know I never want to discourage

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.470 
both you know I never want to discourage
people<00:02:46.069> from<00:02:46.220> really<00:02:46.579> going<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.909> and<00:02:47.120> skating

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
people from really going on and skating

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.119 
people from really going on and skating
by<00:02:47.599> making<00:02:47.930> video<00:02:48.139> games<00:02:48.200> in<00:02:48.590> fact<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.920> think

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
by making video games in fact I think

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.490 
by making video games in fact I think
that<00:02:49.310> our<00:02:49.760> game<00:02:50.000> has<00:02:50.269> inspired<00:02:50.720> many<00:02:51.170> people

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
that our game has inspired many people

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.649 
that our game has inspired many people
to<00:02:51.560> go<00:02:51.680> try<00:02:51.950> skateboarding<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.389> feel<00:02:53.629> like

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
to go try skateboarding and I feel like

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.449 
to go try skateboarding and I feel like
the<00:02:53.959> same<00:02:54.109> is<00:02:54.500> true<00:02:54.530> with<00:02:54.920> our<00:02:55.069> new<00:02:55.220> game<00:02:55.430> that

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the same is true with our new game that

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.520 
the same is true with our new game that
that<00:02:56.090> ended<00:02:56.450> with<00:02:56.599> but<00:02:56.840> our<00:02:56.959> new<00:02:57.109> game<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.379> much

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
that ended with but our new game is much

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.379 
that ended with but our new game is much
more<00:02:57.739> physically<00:02:58.220> active<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.790> mean<00:02:59.060> if<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.329> if

Tony went the competition route and was

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.629 
Tony went the competition route and was
successful<00:04:31.360> like<00:04:31.780> no<00:04:32.050> one<00:04:32.319> else<00:04:32.590> he<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.400> the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
successful like no one else he is the

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.610 
successful like no one else he is the
Michael<00:04:33.789> Jordan<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.449> skateboarding<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.409> what

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
Michael Jordan of skateboarding so what

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.619 
Michael Jordan of skateboarding so what
could<00:04:35.770> be<00:04:35.919> closer<00:04:36.220> than<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.969> compete<00:04:37.389> in<00:04:37.539> the

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
could be closer than to compete in the

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:42.740 
could be closer than to compete in the
world's<00:04:37.930> biggest<00:04:38.139> sport<00:04:38.590> event<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.280> Olympics

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.190 

I<00:04:43.730> think<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:44.790> that<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.480> Olympics<00:04:45.750> needs

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
I think that that the Olympics needs

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.420 
I think that that the Olympics needs
skateboarding<00:04:46.920> more<00:04:47.100> than<00:04:47.250> skateboarding

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
skateboarding more than skateboarding

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.100 
skateboarding more than skateboarding
newsy<00:04:47.910> Olympics<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.420> think<00:04:48.600> they<00:04:48.720> need<00:04:48.930> that

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
newsy Olympics I think they need that

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.950 
newsy Olympics I think they need that
cool<00:04:49.320> factor<00:04:49.740> in<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:49.920> youth<00:04:50.250> factor<00:04:50.700> I<00:04:51.510> think

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
cool factor in that youth factor I think

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.110 
cool factor in that youth factor I think
it<00:04:52.020> would<00:04:52.110> be<00:04:52.200> great<00:04:52.350> for<00:04:52.910> skateboarding<00:04:53.910> on<00:04:54.060> a

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
it would be great for skateboarding on a

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.090 
it would be great for skateboarding on a
global<00:04:54.450> level<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:55.260> be<00:04:55.380> recognized<00:04:55.830> in<00:04:55.950> other

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
global level to be recognized in other

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.260 
global level to be recognized in other
countries<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.580> may<00:04:56.790> have<00:04:56.940> never<00:04:57.150> been

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
that the physical act of skating could

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.040 
that the physical act of skating could
come<00:05:44.469> so<00:05:44.650> far<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:44.949> evolve<00:05:45.400> so<00:05:45.639> much<00:05:45.930> with<00:05:46.930> the
