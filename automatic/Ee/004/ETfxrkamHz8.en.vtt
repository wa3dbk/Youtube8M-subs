00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.050

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.720
 sunday dance terminal dance we lead 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.369
 have stars here today on the parquet 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.290
 one of the highlights I think 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.450
 pay at the point is also that 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.760
 Dance tournament what we are allowed to experience today 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.760
 it's about the düsseldorf airport cup 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.690
 is not for a dance tournament here 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.310
 normal atmosphere it is more or 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.300
 Almost almost open air in the 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.530
 terminal hall 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 additional visitors then here in 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 terminal in the stores and everywhere i 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.390
 I think that's a win-win situation 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.110
 on the one hand for the jump to 2 but 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.410
 of course also for the airport 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410
 Dusseldorf 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.780
 brings from the very good starts the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.780
 dance closer to the fifa 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.439

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.030
