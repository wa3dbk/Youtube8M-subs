00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
it's trapped as it it advertised in the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.749 
it's trapped as it it advertised in the
back<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.619> package<00:01:12.009> but<00:01:12.549> you're<00:01:12.670> not

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
back of the package but you're not

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.100 
back of the package but you're not
really<00:01:12.940> you're<00:01:13.210> not<00:01:13.240> really<00:01:13.540> missing<00:01:13.930> out<00:01:14.080> on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
really you're not really missing out on

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.480 
really you're not really missing out on
anything<00:01:14.500> if<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.799> don't<00:01:14.950> have<00:01:15.100> them<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.400> I

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
anything if you don't have them and I

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.380 
anything if you don't have them and I
don't<00:01:15.640> think<00:01:15.790> they're<00:01:15.909> totally<00:01:16.240> necessary

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
don't think they're totally necessary

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.660 
don't think they're totally necessary
but<00:01:17.350> I<00:01:17.380> think<00:01:17.710> some<00:01:17.890> black<00:01:18.130> paint<00:01:18.399> in<00:01:18.520> there

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
but I think some black paint in there

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.580 
but I think some black paint in there
would<00:01:18.790> have<00:01:18.909> really<00:01:19.119> made<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.390> pop<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:20.259> again

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
would have really made it pop so again

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.410 
would have really made it pop so again
you're<00:01:20.950> not<00:01:21.070> totally<00:01:21.310> necessary<00:01:21.610> for<00:01:22.330> this

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
you're not totally necessary for this

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.460 
you're not totally necessary for this
carnage<00:01:22.810> probably<00:01:23.110> would<00:01:23.259> have<00:01:23.320> been<00:01:23.409> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
carnage probably would have been the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.530 
carnage probably would have been the
definitive<00:01:23.860> one<00:01:24.310> for<00:01:24.610> me<00:01:24.729> if<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.090> wasn't<00:01:25.420> for

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
definitive one for me if it wasn't for

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.840 
definitive one for me if it wasn't for
the<00:01:25.659> mix<00:01:25.899> between<00:01:26.049> two<00:01:26.440> series<00:01:26.799> one<00:01:27.040> which<00:01:27.670> is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
the mix between two series one which is

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.280 
the mix between two series one which is
pretty<00:01:28.030> awesome<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.630> doesn't<00:01:28.960> look<00:01:29.049> too

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
pretty awesome and it doesn't look too

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.719 
pretty awesome and it doesn't look too
different<00:01:29.619> from<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:29.890> because<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:30.580> one

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
different from this because this one

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.160 
different from this because this one
does<00:01:30.909> look<00:01:30.940> actually<00:01:31.600> pretty<00:01:31.810> good<00:01:31.899> for<00:01:31.960> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
does look actually pretty good for the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.930 
does look actually pretty good for the
time<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.440> came<00:01:32.590> out<00:01:32.770> but<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.369> believe<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:33.820> no

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
time it came out but I believe that no

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.219 
time it came out but I believe that no
one<00:01:34.090> does<00:01:34.240> look<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.509> lot<00:01:34.630> more<00:01:34.780> comic<00:01:35.110> book

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
one does look a lot more comic book

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.749 
one does look a lot more comic book
accurate<00:01:35.679> but<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:35.950> one<00:01:36.130> does<00:01:36.250> have<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.429> lot<00:01:36.610> of

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
accurate but this one does have a lot of

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.719 
accurate but this one does have a lot of
really<00:01:36.910> nice<00:01:37.119> paints<00:01:37.630> very<00:01:38.289> much

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
really nice paints very much

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.710 
really nice paints very much
cool-looking<00:01:39.729> much<00:01:39.940> better<00:01:40.270> than<00:01:40.539> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
cool-looking much better than the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.749 
cool-looking much better than the
original<00:01:41.229> one<00:01:41.259> because<00:01:41.649> from<00:01:42.429> what<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.640> can

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
original one because from what I can

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.730 
original one because from what I can
tell<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.360> original<00:01:43.840> release<00:01:43.960> didn't<00:01:44.500> have<00:01:44.619> as

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
tell the original release didn't have as

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.350 
tell the original release didn't have as
much<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.100> black<00:01:45.280> paint<00:01:45.520> going<00:01:45.700> in<00:01:45.940> between<00:01:46.240> all

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
much of black paint going in between all

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.540 
much of black paint going in between all
the<00:01:46.450> goopy<00:01:46.869> areas<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.860> symbiote<00:01:48.280> going

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
the goopy areas of the symbiote going

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.620 
the goopy areas of the symbiote going
throughout<00:01:48.789> him<00:01:49.000> because<00:01:49.210> he<00:01:49.300> does<00:01:49.450> have<00:01:49.509> a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
throughout him because he does have a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.410 
throughout him because he does have a
lot<00:01:49.929> of<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:51.399> I've<00:01:51.550> noticed<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:52.030> lot<00:01:52.179> of<00:01:52.300> with

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
lot of it but I've noticed a lot of with

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.880 
lot of it but I've noticed a lot of with
this<00:01:52.569> figure<00:01:52.899> that<00:01:52.929> he<00:01:53.140> does<00:01:53.289> get<00:01:53.470> very<00:01:53.679> loose

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
this figure that he does get very loose

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.130 
this figure that he does get very loose
either<00:01:54.640> straight<00:01:55.000> at<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.149> package<00:01:55.600> or<00:01:55.840> just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
either straight at a package or just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.139 
either straight at a package or just
over<00:01:56.380> time<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:57.159> he's<00:01:57.460> kind<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.700> difficult<00:01:58.090> to

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
over time and he's kind of difficult to

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.149 
over time and he's kind of difficult to
stand<00:01:58.300> sometimes<00:01:58.750> right<00:01:59.050> now<00:01:59.259> he's<00:01:59.950> doing

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
stand sometimes right now he's doing

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.620 
stand sometimes right now he's doing
pretty<00:02:00.220> good<00:02:00.520> because<00:02:00.729> I've<00:02:00.940> had<00:02:01.060> some<00:02:01.210> issues

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
pretty good because I've had some issues

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.180 
pretty good because I've had some issues
where<00:02:01.869> like<00:02:02.080> in-between<00:02:02.259> his<00:02:02.590> crotch<00:02:02.920> piece

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
where like in-between his crotch piece

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.649 
where like in-between his crotch piece
kind<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.550> just<00:02:03.700> goes<00:02:03.819> apart<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.330> have<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.509> glue

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
kind of just goes apart and have to glue

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.480 
kind of just goes apart and have to glue
it<00:02:04.750> back<00:02:04.780> together<00:02:05.079> so<00:02:05.469> that's<00:02:06.009> probably<00:02:06.340> an

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
it back together so that's probably an

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.160 
it back together so that's probably an
issue<00:02:06.579> that's<00:02:06.939> either<00:02:07.119> just<00:02:07.479> special<00:02:07.810> for<00:02:07.960> me

issue that's either just special for me
or<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.470> don't<00:02:09.280> know<00:02:09.429> if<00:02:09.489> it's<00:02:09.610> like<00:02:09.729> an<00:02:09.880> entire

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.870 
or I don't know if it's like an entire
thing<00:02:10.630> with<00:02:10.810> everybody<00:02:11.200> but<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.220> detail<00:02:12.760> this

guy does have a lot of nice detail as I

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.560 
guy does have a lot of nice detail as I
said<00:02:15.280> before<00:02:15.430> he<00:02:15.670> does<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:15.940> silver<00:02:16.269> paint<00:02:16.480> on

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
said before he does have silver paint on

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.420 
said before he does have silver paint on
the<00:02:16.660> ice<00:02:16.780> instead<00:02:16.989> of<00:02:17.230> white<00:02:17.470> what<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.160> like

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the ice instead of white what you I like

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.830 
the ice instead of white what you I like
because<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.150> does<00:02:19.299> have<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.750> nice

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
because it does have a really nice

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.289 
because it does have a really nice
reflective<00:02:20.320> sheen<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.549> it<00:02:21.579> and<00:02:21.940> does<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.239> a

reflective sheen to it and does have a
lot<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:23.590> pink<00:02:23.920> area<00:02:24.130> in<00:02:24.549> between<00:02:24.670> the

lot of this pink area in between the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.490 
lot of this pink area in between the
globe<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.239> his<00:02:25.390> mouth<00:02:25.630> which<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.049> guess<00:02:26.230> is

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
globe of his mouth which I guess is

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.140 
globe of his mouth which I guess is
supposed<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.160> be<00:02:27.280> kind<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.519> like<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> tongue<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
my crazy head is kind of made up for

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.280 
my crazy head is kind of made up for
myself<00:02:54.940> but<00:02:55.120> otherwise<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.109> looks

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
myself but otherwise it just looks

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.190 
myself but otherwise it just looks
awesome<00:02:56.500> again<00:02:57.430> with<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.700> chest<00:02:58.000> all<00:02:58.900> across

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.420 
awesome again with the chest all across
the<00:02:59.380> abdomen<00:02:59.530> section<00:03:00.010> looks<00:03:00.130> really<00:03:00.310> nice

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
the abdomen section looks really nice

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.640 
the abdomen section looks really nice
with<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:00.730> goop<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.239> then<00:03:01.720> across<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.049> arms

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
with the goop and then across the arms

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.170 
with the goop and then across the arms
and<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> ball<00:03:03.250> joints<00:03:03.549> in<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.730> audience<00:03:04.030> are

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
and the ball joints in the audience are

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.849 
and the ball joints in the audience are
the<00:03:04.329> only<00:03:04.450> sections<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.079> do<00:03:05.140> not<00:03:05.320> have<00:03:05.530> any<00:03:05.709> of

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
the only sections I do not have any of

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.039 
the only sections I do not have any of
this<00:03:06.010> really<00:03:06.730> awesome<00:03:07.000> paint<00:03:07.450> detail<00:03:07.780> or

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
this really awesome paint detail or

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.809 
this really awesome paint detail or
sculpts<00:03:08.560> which<00:03:09.010> isn't<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.340> big<00:03:09.489> deal<00:03:09.670> because

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
sculpts which isn't a big deal because

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.990 
sculpts which isn't a big deal because
they're<00:03:10.060> really<00:03:10.239> tiny<00:03:10.659> and<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.739> think<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
they're really tiny and I think that the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.540 
they're really tiny and I think that the
original<00:03:13.239> one<00:03:13.629> had<00:03:13.840> armpit<00:03:14.230> joint

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
original one had armpit joint

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.040 
original one had armpit joint
but<00:03:14.670> this<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:14.970> they're<00:03:15.210> kind<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.510> isn't

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
but this one they're kind of just isn't

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.420 
but this one they're kind of just isn't
maybe<00:03:16.320> because<00:03:16.620> there's<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.860> really<00:03:17.100> small

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
maybe because there's a really small

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.430 
maybe because there's a really small
area<00:03:17.700> right<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:18.540> because<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.110> see<00:03:19.290> this

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
area right here because you can see this

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.930 
area right here because you can see this
like<00:03:19.620> there's<00:03:19.800> one<00:03:19.920> extra<00:03:20.100> plastic<00:03:20.550> right

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
like there's one extra plastic right

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.760 
like there's one extra plastic right
here<00:03:21.210> where<00:03:21.840> it'll<00:03:22.110> look<00:03:22.200> like<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.500> would<00:03:22.680> have

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
here where it'll look like it would have

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
compared to our new carnage which I

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.530 
compared to our new carnage which I
think<00:04:28.080> definitely<00:04:28.320> trams<00:04:28.950> over<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.790> even

think definitely trams over it and even
though<00:04:30.660> it's<00:04:30.870> not<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.290> that<00:04:31.440> much<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.710> an
