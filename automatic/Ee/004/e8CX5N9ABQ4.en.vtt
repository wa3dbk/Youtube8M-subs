00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
enhanced the battery capacity so you get

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.590 
enhanced the battery capacity so you get
a<00:00:39.230> longer<00:00:39.380> battery<00:00:39.590> life<00:00:39.800> as<00:00:40.550> 1.6<00:00:41.450> meters

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
a longer battery life as 1.6 meters

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.740 
a longer battery life as 1.6 meters
quad-core<00:00:42.470> processor<00:00:43.100> here<00:00:43.370> now<00:00:43.570> you<00:00:44.570> also

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
quad-core processor here now you also

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.290 
quad-core processor here now you also
have<00:00:44.930> two<00:00:45.110> gigs<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.500> RAM<00:00:45.710> we<00:00:46.610> also<00:00:46.760> change<00:00:47.210> the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
have two gigs of RAM we also change the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.060 
have two gigs of RAM we also change the
bat<00:00:47.570> are<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.020> flash<00:00:48.230> little<00:00:48.590> bit<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:48.890> if<00:00:48.980> you

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
want to like Emmanuel bounce you can do

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.920 
want to like Emmanuel bounce you can do
that<00:00:51.230> with<00:00:51.770> your<00:00:51.830> little<00:00:52.580> bit<00:00:52.730> lighter<00:00:52.940> we

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
that with your little bit lighter we

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.080 
that with your little bit lighter we
also<00:00:54.080> added<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.590> few<00:00:54.830> new<00:00:55.070> smart<00:00:55.670> modes<00:00:55.910> into

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
also added a few new smart modes into

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.060 
also added a few new smart modes into
the<00:00:56.210> camera<00:00:56.480> as<00:00:56.690> well<00:00:56.720> so<00:00:57.560> if<00:00:57.650> you<00:00:57.770> have<00:00:57.890> the
