00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
doing a tutorial so you know where to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
doing a tutorial so you know where to
find<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> colors<00:00:35.550> well<00:00:35.730> anyway<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.510> had

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
find the colors well anyway I had

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.729 
find the colors well anyway I had
colored<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.370> um<00:00:39.170> just<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> pencils

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
here from the prima set and then I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.690 
here from the prima set and then I
thought<00:00:43.649> well<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> doesn't<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> punch

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
thought well it doesn't know the punch

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.610 
thought well it doesn't know the punch
if<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.270> colors<00:00:45.539> felt<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:45.989> dull<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.500> I'm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
if the colors felt a little dull so I'm

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.900 
if the colors felt a little dull so I'm
like<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> know<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.340> spectrum<00:00:47.700> noir

Prima so exciting we've got the 44 in
the<00:02:01.290> spectrum<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.950> these<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.340> gonna<00:02:02.460> match<00:02:02.700> at

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the spectrum so these are gonna match at

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209

the spectrum noir pencils exactly so
when<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.490> when<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> saw<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> bit<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.509> was<00:02:06.899> originally

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
when I when I saw a bit I was originally

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.369 
when I when I saw a bit I was originally
tipped<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.520> these<00:02:08.729> pencils<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:10.229> there

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
tipped off that these pencils that there

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.199 
tipped off that these pencils that there
might<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.560> other<00:02:10.679> colors<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.819> they<00:02:11.970> might<00:02:12.120> be

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
might be other colors or they might be

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.100 
might be other colors or they might be
made<00:02:12.360> by<00:02:12.510> somebody

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
made by somebody

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.450 
made by somebody
because<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.070> are<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.450> 40-somethings

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
because these are the 40-somethings

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.440 
because these are the 40-somethings
because<00:02:17.460> they<00:02:17.820> were<00:02:17.880> like<00:02:18.210> they<00:02:18.420> were

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
because they were like they were

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.120 
because they were like they were
remembered<00:02:18.930> between<00:02:19.230> 1<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.560> 20<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:19.980> there

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
remembered between 1 and 20 but there

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.970 
remembered between 1 and 20 but there
are<00:02:20.190> only<00:02:20.280> 48<00:02:20.730> colors<00:02:21.410> unique<00:02:22.410> colors<00:02:22.740> there

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
are only 48 colors unique colors there

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.370 
are only 48 colors unique colors there
so<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:24.330> made<00:02:24.480> me<00:02:24.510> think<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.960> probably

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
so that made me think that probably

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.560 
so that made me think that probably
there<00:02:25.830> were<00:02:25.920> more<00:02:26.070> colors<00:02:26.400> I've<00:02:26.520> got<00:02:26.640> 58<00:02:27.210> here

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
there were more colors I've got 58 here

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.680 
there were more colors I've got 58 here
Olivia<00:02:27.870> there<00:02:28.050> are<00:02:28.110> 58<00:02:28.880> green<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.450> don't<00:02:30.510> know

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
Olivia there are 58 green I don't know

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.630 
Olivia there are 58 green I don't know

if I did that color up 58 maybe I just

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.490 
if I did that color up 58 maybe I just
said<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.120> don't<00:02:33.420> worry<00:02:33.570> okay<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.380> got

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
color is just one is water-soluble and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.640 
color is just one is water-soluble and
one<00:03:02.490> isn't<00:03:02.850> but<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> exact<00:03:03.510> same<00:03:03.780> color

I've<00:03:10.560> already<00:03:10.650> taken<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.190> picture<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.610> I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
I've already taken a picture of it I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.460 
I've already taken a picture of it I
didn't<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.180> worry<00:03:12.390> about<00:03:12.840> keeping<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
didn't have to worry about keeping a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.010 
didn't have to worry about keeping a
pristine<00:03:13.830> or<00:03:13.920> anything<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.370> went<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.750> I

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
pristine or anything I went in and I

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.750 
pristine or anything I went in and I
colored<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.440> little<00:03:16.620> swatch<00:03:16.950> next<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.459> every

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
colored a little swatch next to every

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.550 
colored a little swatch next to every
single<00:03:18.120> color<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.660> already<00:03:19.020> had<00:03:19.260> because

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
single color that I already had because

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.530 
single color that I already had because
I<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.370> wanted<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.610> make<00:03:20.700> sure<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.330> was

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
I just wanted to make sure that it was

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.990 
I just wanted to make sure that it was
it<00:03:21.870> was<00:03:22.110> truly<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.220> same<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.520> all<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> colors

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
it was truly the same to all the colors

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000 
it was truly the same to all the colors
and<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.150> wasn't<00:03:24.360> just<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.660> fluke<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.770> was

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and that wasn't just a fluke and it was

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.800 
and that wasn't just a fluke and it was
and<00:03:26.340> then<00:03:26.730> there<00:03:26.910> were<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.330> places<00:03:27.660> where<00:03:27.780> I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and then there were in places where I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.600 
and then there were in places where I
didn't<00:03:28.140> have<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.590> colors<00:03:28.890> but<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> knew<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
didn't have the colors but I knew that

for other ones that was missing from
like<00:03:35.220> scenic<00:03:35.489> route<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.330> put<00:03:36.480> them<00:03:36.600> in

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
like scenic route and I just put them in

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.030 
like scenic route and I just put them in
there<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.770> that<00:03:37.860> reference

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
there just so I have that reference

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.770 
there just so I have that reference
they're<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.820> same<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.300> exact<00:03:39.570> same

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
they're the same it's the exact same

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.690 
they're the same it's the exact same
color<00:03:40.020> palette<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.920> don't<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.520> what<00:03:41.610> this

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
color palette so I don't know what this

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.110 
color palette so I don't know what this
means

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
means

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.670 
means
it<00:03:42.180> obviously<00:03:42.270> means<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.050> these<00:03:43.410> kind<00:03:43.650> of

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
it obviously means that these kind of

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.890 
it obviously means that these kind of
these<00:03:43.800> pencils<00:03:44.220> were<00:03:44.310> most<00:03:44.850> likely<00:03:45.209> lead<00:03:45.600> in

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
these pencils were most likely lead in

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.870 
these pencils were most likely lead in
the<00:03:45.989> same<00:03:46.200> company<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.890> same<00:03:47.070> plant<00:03:47.370> for

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
the same company the same plant for

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.460 
the same company the same plant for
these<00:03:47.970> different<00:03:48.270> outfits<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.140> think

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
these different outfits but I think

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.750 
these different outfits but I think
would<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.620> totally<00:03:50.040> cool<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.340> see<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.550> full

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.410 
would be totally cool to see the full
range<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.260> spectrum<00:03:52.830> Noirs<00:03:53.070> in
