anyways<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.000> does<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.810> 60<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.500> 1080<00:01:53.159> 60<00:01:53.369> i<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
anyways it does do 60 i 1080 60 i and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.410 
anyways it does do 60 i 1080 60 i and
the<00:01:54.149> 3200<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.670> point<00:01:57.299> number

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the 3200 does not so that's point number

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.410 
the 3200 does not so that's point number
one<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.280> video<00:01:59.490> abilities<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.210> better

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
one then the video abilities are better

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.249 
one then the video abilities are better
on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> 5200<00:02:01.579> point<00:02:02.579> number<00:02:02.850> two<00:02:03.200> we've<00:02:04.200> got

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
on the 5200 point number two we've got

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.839

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250 
the d 3200 so all else being equal
we've<00:02:13.709> got<00:02:14.090> better<00:02:15.090> information<00:02:15.660> gathering

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
we've got better information gathering

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.820 
we've got better information gathering
abilities<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.190> 5200<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> point<00:02:19.740> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
abilities on the 5200 this is a point of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.260 
abilities on the 5200 this is a point of
contention<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:20.610> people<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.150> to

contention for some people they like to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.699 
contention for some people they like to
argue<00:02:21.600> this<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.530> can't

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
argue this and you know that you can't

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
see the difference and whatnot and and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.220 
see the difference and whatnot and and
that<00:02:25.650> into<00:02:26.400> large<00:02:26.640> degree<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.209> true<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:28.020> always

that into large degree is true I always

arguments go on I see people are looking

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.170 
arguments go on I see people are looking
at<00:02:31.950> prints<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.370> I've<00:02:32.430> never<00:02:32.610> really<00:02:32.880> seen<00:02:33.090> the

at prints and I've never really seen the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.350 
at prints and I've never really seen the
difference<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.750> paper<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.830> 5200<00:02:35.700> is

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
difference but on paper the 5200 is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.040 
difference but on paper the 5200 is
14-bit<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.380> 3200<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.250> 12<00:02:38.610> bit<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.720> an

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
14-bit the 3200 is 12 bit so that is an

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.880 
14-bit the 3200 is 12 bit so that is an
advantage<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.950> 5200<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.510> probably<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
advantage to the 5200 and probably you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.060 
advantage to the 5200 and probably you
know<00:02:44.010> certain<00:02:45.230> processing<00:02:46.230> programs<00:02:46.709> for

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
know certain processing programs for

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.830 
know certain processing programs for
your<00:02:47.220> images<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.760> whatnot<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.360> gonna<00:02:48.630> be

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
your images and whatnot are gonna be

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.699 
your images and whatnot are gonna be
able<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.090> little<00:02:51.630> bit<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.019> an<00:02:52.320> advantage

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
able to see a little bit of an advantage

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.630 
able to see a little bit of an advantage
there<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.630> things<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.810> maybe<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:56.160> tonal

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
there in things like maybe the tonal

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.460 
there in things like maybe the tonal
range<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.120> sky<00:02:57.480> or<00:02:57.780> something<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.290> might

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
range of a sky or something you might

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.590 
range of a sky or something you might
you<00:02:58.709> might<00:02:58.980> see<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.550> difference<00:03:00.000> there<00:03:00.209> but

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
you might see a difference there but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.670 
you might see a difference there but
again<00:03:00.750> advantage<00:03:01.709> 5,200<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.959> third<00:03:04.319> ones

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
again advantage 5,200 the third ones

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.479 
again advantage 5,200 the third ones
that<00:03:05.100> we<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.430> here<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.310> better

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that we have here is the the better

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.930 
that we have here is the the better
autofocus<00:03:09.420> system<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.830> 5200<00:03:11.519> over<00:03:11.819> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
autofocus system in the 5200 over the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.330 
autofocus system in the 5200 over the
3200<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.200> significant<00:03:13.890> because<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
3200 and this is significant because the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.440 
3200 and this is significant because the
5200<00:03:15.120> has<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.480> cam<00:03:15.860> 4800<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.880> 39

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
5200 has the cam 4800 that is the 39

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.550 
5200 has the cam 4800 that is the 39
sensor<00:03:19.049> 9<00:03:19.470> cross<00:03:19.829> has<00:03:20.100> 9<00:03:20.760> crosshatch<00:03:21.690> sensor

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
sensor 9 cross has 9 crosshatch sensor

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.860 
sensor 9 cross has 9 crosshatch sensor
system<00:03:23.160> which<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.850> significantly<00:03:24.630> better

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
system which is significantly better

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.800 
system which is significantly better
than<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.110> 3200<00:03:25.890> scam<00:03:26.220> 1000<00:03:27.060> which<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.299> an<00:03:27.390> 11

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
than the 3200 scam 1000 which is an 11

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.530 
than the 3200 scam 1000 which is an 11
sensor<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.709> crosshatch<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.030> get<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.180> lot

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
sensor one crosshatch so you get a lot

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.740 
sensor one crosshatch so you get a lot
better<00:03:30.900> autofocus<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.220> d50<00:03:32.790> 200<00:03:33.299> this

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
better autofocus on the d50 200 this

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.810 
better autofocus on the d50 200 this
alone<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.440> probably<00:03:34.709> worth<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.400> difference

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
alone is probably worth the difference

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.759 
alone is probably worth the difference
in<00:03:35.970> price<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.810> two<00:03:36.989> cameras<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.620> that

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
in price of the two cameras just that

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.759 
in price of the two cameras just that
single<00:03:38.220> point<00:03:38.370> right<00:03:38.670> there<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:40.350> next<00:03:40.530> one

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
single point right there the next one

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.840 
single point right there the next one
the<00:03:40.920> fourth<00:03:41.220> point<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.950> 2016<00:03:43.950> pixel<00:03:44.459> color

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
the fourth point is the 2016 pixel color

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.110 
the fourth point is the 2016 pixel color
matrix<00:03:45.420> system<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.829> you're<00:03:46.980> basically<00:03:47.459> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
matrix system so you're basically the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.380 
matrix system so you're basically the
metering<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:49.049> much<00:03:49.620> better<00:03:49.890> on<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.220> 5200<00:03:50.820> than

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
metering is much better on the 5200 than

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.440 
metering is much better on the 5200 than
it<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.600> on<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.870> 3200<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.739> 3200<00:03:53.400> has<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> 420

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
it is on the 3200 the 3200 has a 420

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.280 
it is on the 3200 the 3200 has a 420
pixel<00:03:54.900> system<00:03:55.859> versus<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.459> 5200<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.290> 2016

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
pixel system versus the 5200 to 2016

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.479 
pixel system versus the 5200 to 2016
color<00:03:58.590> pixel<00:03:59.010> system<00:03:59.340> so<00:04:01.160> 5200<00:04:02.160> has<00:04:02.250> better

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
color pixel system so 5200 has better

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.479 
color pixel system so 5200 has better
metering<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.209> sense<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.920> fifth<00:04:05.250> point

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
metering in that sense the fifth point

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.120 
metering in that sense the fifth point
is<00:04:06.230> exposure<00:04:07.230> bracketing<00:04:07.500> we've<00:04:07.980> got

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
is exposure bracketing we've got

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.680 
is exposure bracketing we've got
exposure<00:04:08.519> bracketing<00:04:08.760> available<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.600> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
exposure bracketing available on the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.140 
exposure bracketing available on the
5200<00:04:10.140> we<00:04:10.590> don't<00:04:10.950> have<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.400> available<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:12.000> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
5200 we don't have that available on the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.690 
5200 we don't have that available on the
3200<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.049> we've<00:04:13.170> got<00:04:13.350> three<00:04:13.560> frames<00:04:13.859> exposure

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
3200 so we've got three frames exposure

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.370 
3200 so we've got three frames exposure
bracketing<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.329> we've<00:04:15.810> also<00:04:15.959> got<00:04:16.140> white

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
bracketing and we've also got white

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.960 
bracketing and we've also got white
balance<00:04:16.799> bracketing<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.340> some<00:04:17.489> HDR

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
balance bracketing and some HDR

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.659 
balance bracketing and some HDR
bracketing<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.750> that's<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.470> bonus<00:04:19.829> on<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.220> 5200

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
bracketing so that's a bonus on the 5200

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.990 
bracketing so that's a bonus on the 5200
that<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.150> don't<00:04:21.450> get<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.159> 3200<00:04:23.159> number

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
that you don't get on the 3200 number

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.260 
that you don't get on the 3200 number
six<00:04:24.390> is<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.710> ISO<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.520> high<00:04:26.729> is

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
six is the ISO the high is

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.450 
six is the ISO the high is
specifically<00:04:27.960> we've<00:04:28.440> got<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> greater<00:04:29.069> range

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
specifically we've got a greater range

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.689 
specifically we've got a greater range
on<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.060> 5200<00:04:30.539> the<00:04:30.930> 5200<00:04:31.680> allows<00:04:31.919> us<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.550> go

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
on the 5200 the 5200 allows us to go

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.020 
on the 5200 the 5200 allows us to go
from<00:04:32.910> 200<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.449> 6400<00:04:34.199> with<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:34.949> high<00:04:35.250> one<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.759> high

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
from 200 to 6400 with a high one a high

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.680 
from 200 to 6400 with a high one a high
two<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.660> auto<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.740> 3200<00:04:38.550> only<00:04:38.880> has<00:04:39.060> high<00:04:39.389> one

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
two and auto the 3200 only has high one

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.219 
two and auto the 3200 only has high one
in<00:04:39.870> Auto<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.470> get<00:04:40.620> one<00:04:40.949> more<00:04:42.080> official<00:04:43.080> if

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
in Auto so you get one more official if

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.650 
in Auto so you get one more official if
you<00:04:43.319> want<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.620> call<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.949> that<00:04:44.090> high<00:04:45.090> ISO

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
you want to call it that high ISO

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.189 
you want to call it that high ISO
setting<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.650> 5200<00:04:47.160> over<00:04:47.819> the<00:04:47.970> 3200<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.870> I

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
setting on the 5200 over the 3200 and I

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.230 
setting on the 5200 over the 3200 and I
would<00:04:49.380> suspect<00:04:49.590> Nikon's<00:04:50.430> probably<00:04:50.910> tweak

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
would suspect Nikon's probably tweak

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.540 
would suspect Nikon's probably tweak
that<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.530> are<00:04:52.710> actually<00:04:52.979> getting<00:04:53.310> a

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
that so you are actually getting a

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.800 
that so you are actually getting a
little<00:04:53.729> better<00:04:53.970> higher<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.509> with<00:04:54.660> those

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
little better higher so with those

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.330 
little better higher so with those
high-end<00:04:55.169> settings<00:04:55.650> then<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.979> are<00:04:56.130> on<00:04:56.250> the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
high-end settings then you are on the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.600 
high-end settings then you are on the
3200<00:04:57.090> that'll<00:04:57.630> will<00:04:58.349> we'll<00:04:58.800> see<00:04:59.069> that<00:04:59.250> when<00:04:59.490> we

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
3200 that'll will we'll see that when we

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.879 
3200 that'll will we'll see that when we
see<00:04:59.819> some<00:05:00.060> more<00:05:00.780> images<00:05:01.020> coming<00:05:01.530> out<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.800> these

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
see some more images coming out of these

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.670 
see some more images coming out of these
two<00:05:02.099> but<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.340> suspect<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:03.030> 5200<00:05:03.720> is<00:05:03.840> therefore

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
two but I suspect the 5200 is therefore

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.469 
two but I suspect the 5200 is therefore
a<00:05:04.710> little<00:05:04.979> bit<00:05:05.159> better<00:05:05.430> at<00:05:05.639> high<00:05:05.819> so<00:05:06.270> they've

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
a little bit better at high so they've

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.879 
a little bit better at high so they've
tweaked<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.930> just<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.199> little<00:05:07.440> bit<00:05:07.530> more<00:05:07.680> than

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
tweaked it just a little bit more than

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.620 
tweaked it just a little bit more than
the<00:05:07.979> 3200<00:05:09.139> number<00:05:10.139> seven<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.759> LCD<00:05:12.150> we've

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
the 3200 number seven is the LCD we've

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.580 
the 3200 number seven is the LCD we've
got<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.229> same<00:05:13.590> specs<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.669> far<00:05:14.909> as<00:05:15.560> 921,000<00:05:16.560> dot

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
got the same specs as far as 921,000 dot

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.779 
got the same specs as far as 921,000 dot
LCD<00:05:17.490> we've<00:05:18.030> got<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.330> same<00:05:18.569> 3-inch<00:05:19.380> LCD<00:05:19.789> but

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
LCD we've got the same 3-inch LCD but

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.600 
LCD we've got the same 3-inch LCD but
the<00:05:21.389> LCD<00:05:22.199> obviously<00:05:22.680> on<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.860> 5200<00:05:23.280> is

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
the LCD obviously on the 5200 is

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.760 
the LCD obviously on the 5200 is
positionable<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.449> vary<00:05:24.690> angle<00:05:25.169> positionable

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
positionable to vary angle positionable

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.939 
positionable to vary angle positionable
LCD<00:05:26.310> similar<00:05:26.729> to<00:05:26.819> what<00:05:26.970> was<00:05:27.090> on<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.720> 5100<00:05:28.650> but

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
LCD similar to what was on the 5100 but

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.890 
LCD similar to what was on the 5100 but
you<00:05:29.039> don't<00:05:29.190> get<00:05:29.400> that<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.909> 3200<00:05:30.630> or<00:05:30.720> so

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
you don't get that on the 3200 or so

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.209 
you don't get that on the 3200 or so
that's<00:05:31.050> another<00:05:31.289> big<00:05:31.620> point<00:05:31.919> it's<00:05:32.070> another

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
that's another big point it's another

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.200 
that's another big point it's another
big<00:05:32.550> one<00:05:32.729> for<00:05:33.000> me

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
big one for me

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.020 
big one for me
I<00:05:33.960> would<00:05:34.289> rank<00:05:34.469> that<00:05:34.710> probably<00:05:35.490> be<00:05:35.639> just

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
I would rank that probably be just

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.689 
I would rank that probably be just
behind<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.630> autofocus<00:05:37.460> advances<00:05:38.460> on<00:05:38.639> the

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
behind the autofocus advances on the

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.990 
behind the autofocus advances on the
5200<00:05:39.330> so<00:05:39.949> another<00:05:40.949> big<00:05:41.250> reason<00:05:41.520> you<00:05:41.820> might

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
5200 so another big reason you might

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.909 
5200 so another big reason you might
want<00:05:42.060> to<00:05:42.389> spend<00:05:43.199> a<00:05:43.289> little<00:05:43.380> bit<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.620> extra

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
want to spend a little bit of extra

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.600 
want to spend a little bit of extra
money<00:05:44.039> on<00:05:44.219> the<00:05:44.310> 5200<00:05:44.990> number<00:05:45.990> eight<00:05:46.169> is<00:05:47.039> kind

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
money on the 5200 number eight is kind

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.800 
money on the 5200 number eight is kind
