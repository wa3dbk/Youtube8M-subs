watching where you're stepping and then

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.640 
watching where you're stepping and then
you'd<00:03:36.540> get<00:03:36.660> two<00:03:36.810> points<00:03:37.049> we<00:03:37.170> almost<00:03:37.320> have<00:03:37.530> to

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
you'd get two points we almost have to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.009 
you'd get two points we almost have to
Boulder<00:03:38.070> like<00:03:38.310> climb<00:03:38.580> across<00:03:38.760> rocks<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.810> I

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
Boulder like climb across rocks and I

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.960 
Boulder like climb across rocks and I
was<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.070> happy<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.549> could<00:03:41.730> do<00:03:41.850> it

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
was just so happy that I could do it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.130 
was just so happy that I could do it
again<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.420> didn't<00:03:42.630> bother<00:03:42.750> me<00:03:43.049> it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
again and it didn't bother me it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.930 
again and it didn't bother me it
actually<00:03:43.440> felt<00:03:43.650> really<00:03:43.709> good<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.160> be<00:03:44.579> out<00:03:44.730> and

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
actually felt really good to be out and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.120 
actually felt really good to be out and
doing<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.810> kind<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.049> activity<00:03:46.530> we<00:03:46.560> walked<00:03:46.860> I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
doing that kind of activity we walked I

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.970 
doing that kind of activity we walked I
think<00:03:47.790> five<00:03:48.030> or<00:03:48.060> six<00:03:48.420> miles<00:03:48.630> last<00:03:49.079> weekend<00:03:49.620> and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
think five or six miles last weekend and

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.310 
think five or six miles last weekend and
then<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:50.940> past<00:03:51.180> weekend<00:03:51.540> over<00:03:51.720> Mother's<00:03:52.019> Day

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
then this past weekend over Mother's Day

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.740 
then this past weekend over Mother's Day
I<00:03:52.590> was<00:03:53.040> up<00:03:53.190> at<00:03:53.340> Penn<00:03:53.489> State<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.180> did<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.570> was

days straight
I<00:04:04.230> think<00:04:04.440> I'm<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.769> clocked<00:04:05.190> my<00:04:05.370> mileage<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.970> think

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
I think I'm I clocked my mileage I think

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.850 
I think I'm I clocked my mileage I think
I<00:04:06.239> did<00:04:06.420> like<00:04:06.600> 13<00:04:07.049> miles<00:04:07.290> or<00:04:07.560> something<00:04:07.769> just

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
I did like 13 miles or something just

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.770 
I did like 13 miles or something just
walking<00:04:08.220> around<00:04:08.310> campus<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.299> had<00:04:09.630> no

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
walking around campus and I had no

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.080 
walking around campus and I had no
problems<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.290> mean<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.530> was<00:04:10.650> tired<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.310> will

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
problems I mean I was tired and I will

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.460 
problems I mean I was tired and I will
admit<00:04:12.209> my<00:04:12.390> back<00:04:12.570> felt<00:04:12.840> like<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> little<00:04:13.350> bit

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
admit my back felt like a little bit

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.979 
admit my back felt like a little bit
sore<00:04:13.829> but<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.790> think<00:04:15.090> anybody's<00:04:15.570> back<00:04:15.780> would

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
sore but I think anybody's back would

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.509 
sore but I think anybody's back would
feel<00:04:16.109> sore<00:04:16.350> after<00:04:16.709> doing<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.130> especially

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
feel sore after doing that especially

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.900 
feel sore after doing that especially
when<00:04:17.880> you're<00:04:18.000> not<00:04:18.090> used<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:20.099> really

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
when you're not used to that so I really

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.390 
when you're not used to that so I really
feel<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.150> I'm<00:04:21.390> fixed<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.989> mean<00:04:22.140> I

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
feel like I'm fixed I mean I

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.310 
feel like I'm fixed I mean I
I<00:04:22.430> don't<00:04:22.729> know<00:04:22.940> what<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.389> future<00:04:23.660> holds<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.139> I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
I don't know what the future holds but I

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.260 
I don't know what the future holds but I
feel<00:04:24.590> like<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.949> fusion<00:04:25.460> was<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.669> very<00:04:26.060> wise

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
feel like this fusion was a very wise

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.689 
feel like this fusion was a very wise
decision<00:04:26.870> for<00:04:26.900> where<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.320> was<00:04:27.620> at<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.070> was

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
decision for where I was at I was

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.340 
decision for where I was at I was
completely<00:04:29.180> limited<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.900> couldn't<00:04:30.259> do

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
completely limited I couldn't do

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.010 
completely limited I couldn't do
anything<00:04:30.770> with<00:04:30.889> my<00:04:31.039> kids<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.669> had<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.479> much<00:04:32.630> pain

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
anything with my kids I had so much pain

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.990 
anything with my kids I had so much pain
I<00:04:33.440> couldn't<00:04:33.710> stand<00:04:34.039> for<00:04:34.280> more<00:04:34.520> than<00:04:34.669> just<00:04:34.910> a

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
I couldn't stand for more than just a

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.650 
I couldn't stand for more than just a
couple<00:04:35.180> minutes<00:04:35.419> at<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.930> time<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.789> that<00:04:38.539> was

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
couple minutes at a time and that was

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.330 
couple minutes at a time and that was
part<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.050> stenosis<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.919> had<00:04:40.130> disc

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
part of the stenosis I had disc

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.129 
part of the stenosis I had disc
degeneration<00:04:40.910> at<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.449> level<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.020> also

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
degeneration at that level and I also

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.779 
degeneration at that level and I also
had<00:04:42.470> stenosis<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.789> if<00:04:44.150> you're<00:04:44.270> feeling<00:04:44.660> like

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
had stenosis so if you're feeling like

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.189 
had stenosis so if you're feeling like
like<00:04:46.789> when<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.030> stand<00:04:47.300> for<00:04:47.449> a<00:04:47.509> long<00:04:47.660> time<00:04:47.960> and

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
like when you stand for a long time and

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.689 
like when you stand for a long time and
you're<00:04:48.289> feeling<00:04:48.650> like<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.979> key<00:04:49.250> like<00:04:49.400> almost

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
you're feeling like a key like almost

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.580 
you're feeling like a key like almost
like<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:49.940> have<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.270> bend<00:04:50.690> over<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.259> you<00:04:51.470> know

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
like you have to bend over and you know

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.010 
like you have to bend over and you know
stretch<00:04:52.009> or<00:04:52.430> get<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.090> tension<00:04:53.750> out<00:04:53.840> of<00:04:53.900> your

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
stretch or get that tension out of your

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.260 
stretch or get that tension out of your
back<00:04:54.259> that<00:04:54.620> that's<00:04:54.860> likely<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.340> stenosis<00:04:55.820> issue

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
back that that's likely a stenosis issue

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.120 
back that that's likely a stenosis issue
because<00:04:56.840> that's<00:04:56.990> like<00:04:57.199> a<00:04:57.289> narrowing<00:04:57.680> of<00:04:57.949> your

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
because that's like a narrowing of your

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.029 
because that's like a narrowing of your
spinal<00:04:58.550> column<00:04:59.080> and<00:05:00.080> that's<00:05:00.500> part<00:05:00.740> of<00:05:00.830> what<00:05:01.010> I

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
spinal column and that's part of what I

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.830 
spinal column and that's part of what I
had<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.699> there's<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:01.910> chance<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.389> it<00:05:02.539> you

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
had and there's a chance that it you

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.290 
had and there's a chance that it you
know<00:05:02.870> might<00:05:03.530> get<00:05:04.490> worse<00:05:04.639> as<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.000> get<00:05:05.180> older

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
know might get worse as I get older

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.850 
know might get worse as I get older
because<00:05:05.539> that's<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.930> natural<00:05:06.110> thing<00:05:06.530> for<00:05:06.560> most

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
because that's a natural thing for most

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.129 
because that's a natural thing for most
people<00:05:07.340> but<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:08.360> happened<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.870> me<00:05:08.990> really

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
people but it happened to me really

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.670 
people but it happened to me really
early<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.860> know<00:05:09.949> I'm<00:05:10.100> I'm<00:05:10.490> 37<00:05:11.030> now<00:05:11.360> so<00:05:11.690> it

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
early you know I'm I'm 37 now so it
