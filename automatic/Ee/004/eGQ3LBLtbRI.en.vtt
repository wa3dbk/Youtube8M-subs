little space so let's get started so

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.759 
little space so let's get started so
what<00:00:36.089> you're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.330> to<00:00:36.390> need<00:00:36.600> first<00:00:36.900> are<00:00:37.199> two

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
what you're going to need first are two

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.020 
what you're going to need first are two
redstone<00:00:38.100> torches<00:00:39.199> for<00:00:40.199> pressure<00:00:40.470> plates<00:00:41.030> 14

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
redstone torches for pressure plates 14

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.219 
redstone torches for pressure plates 14
stone<00:00:42.239> bricks<00:00:42.839> 12<00:00:43.559> redstone<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.600> six<00:00:45.600> sticky

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
stone bricks 12 redstone and six sticky

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.880 
stone bricks 12 redstone and six sticky
pistons<00:00:47.119> so<00:00:48.119> what<00:00:49.049> you're<00:00:49.199> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.409> do<00:00:49.559> first

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
pistons so what you're going to do first

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.149 
pistons so what you're going to do first
is<00:00:50.159> just<00:00:50.670> stack<00:00:51.600> three<00:00:52.049> sticky<00:00:52.500> pistons<00:00:52.949> on

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
is just stack three sticky pistons on

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.240 
is just stack three sticky pistons on
top<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.610> each<00:00:53.729> other<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.920> then<00:00:55.920> put

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
top of each other like this then put

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.850 
top of each other like this then put
three<00:00:56.580> in<00:00:56.729> front<00:00:57.080> three<00:00:58.080> stone<00:00:58.320> bricks<00:00:58.680> in

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
three in front three stone bricks in

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.469 
three in front three stone bricks in
front<00:00:59.159> and<00:01:01.070> then<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.369> skip<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.089> three

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
front and then just skip these three

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:10.280 
front and then just skip these three
spaces<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:05.630> put<00:01:08.090> three<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.300> sticky<00:01:09.840> pistons

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
spaces and put three more sticky pistons

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
spaces and put three more sticky pistons
like<00:01:10.740> fat<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:13.070> then<00:01:14.070> three<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:14.850> stone

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
like fat and then three more stone

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.710 
like fat and then three more stone
bricks<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.430> piston<00:01:17.940> doors<00:01:18.150> open

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
bricks so this is your piston doors open

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.000 
bricks so this is your piston doors open
state<00:01:20.660> so<00:01:21.660> what<00:01:21.900> we're<00:01:22.050> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.260> do<00:01:22.440> next<00:01:22.680> is

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
state so what we're going to do next is

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.420 
state so what we're going to do next is
just<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:24.000> redstone<00:01:24.210> torch<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.310> put<00:01:26.310> another

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
just put redstone torch here put another

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.400 
just put redstone torch here put another
redstone<00:01:26.880> torch<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.690> other<00:01:27.780> side<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
redstone torch on the other side and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.300 
redstone torch on the other side and
then<00:01:31.410> stone<00:01:32.100> brick<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.170> second<00:01:34.310> beside

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
then stone brick on the second beside

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.490 
then stone brick on the second beside
the<00:01:35.490> second<00:01:35.909> sticky<00:01:36.240> piston<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.260> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the second sticky piston and then a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.300 
the second sticky piston and then a
redstone<00:01:37.800> on<00:01:38.100> top<00:01:39.830> if<00:01:40.830> you're<00:01:40.980> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> do

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
redstone on top if you're going to do

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
redstone on top if you're going to do
the<00:01:41.460> same<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.940> here<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.080> your

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the same over here and this is your

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
the same over here and this is your
piston<00:01:46.860> doors<00:01:47.159> closed<00:01:47.700> state<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.060> we're

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
piston doors closed state so what we're

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.350 
piston doors closed state so what we're
going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.630> next<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.909> take<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.060> some

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
going to do next is just take out some

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.440 
going to do next is just take out some
of<00:01:54.390> these<00:01:55.220> blocks<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.400> dirt

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.940 

take<00:02:01.289> another<00:02:01.530> layer<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.950> then

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
take another layer like this and then

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.270 
take another layer like this and then
just<00:02:05.310> connect<00:02:06.119> over<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:09.229> after<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.280> just

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
just connect over here after that just

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.170 
just connect over here after that just
take<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.879> these<00:02:12.090> two<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.930> middle<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.180> do

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
take out these two in the middle and do

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.839 
take out these two in the middle and do
it<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:16.110> connect<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
it just connect it like this this is

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.270 
it just connect it like this this is
over<00:02:18.360> your<00:02:18.540> pressure<00:02:18.750> plate<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.440> it's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
over your pressure plate so it's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.059 
over your pressure plate so it's
important<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.819> do<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:24.050> do<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> same<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.620> this

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
important to do that do the same on this

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.380 
important to do that do the same on this
side<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:29.299> fill<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.480> up<00:02:30.599> with<00:02:32.390> stone

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
side and then just fill it up with stone

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.410 
side and then just fill it up with stone
bricks<00:02:36.380> like<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:40.459> i'll<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.700> use<00:02:41.790> grass

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
bricks like this and i'll just use grass

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.890 
bricks like this and i'll just use grass
blocks<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.170> fill<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.620> part<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.900> then

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
blocks to fill this part up to then

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.920 
blocks to fill this part up to then
after<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.799> put<00:02:47.329> two<00:02:48.329> pressure<00:02:48.599> plates

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
after that just put two pressure plates

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.370 
after that just put two pressure plates
over<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:51.180> pressure<00:02:51.450> plates<00:02:51.780> over<00:02:52.079> here

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
over here to pressure plates over here

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.930 
over here to pressure plates over here
and<00:02:53.299> your<00:02:54.299> piston<00:02:54.780> door<00:02:54.959> should<00:02:55.170> work<00:02:55.940> this

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
and your piston door should work this

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.900 
and your piston door should work this
was<00:02:57.209> very<00:02:57.390> fast<00:02:57.980> process<00:02:58.980> wasn't<00:02:59.519> it<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.910> then

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
was very fast process wasn't it and then

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.569 
was very fast process wasn't it and then
the<00:03:03.780> floor<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> middle<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.799> put<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.430> like

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
the floor in the middle just put it like

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.330 
the floor in the middle just put it like
this<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:08.630> after<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.989> filled<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:10.799> part<00:03:11.190> up

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
this so after you filled this part up

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.210 
this so after you filled this part up
with<00:03:11.700> walls<00:03:12.260> your<00:03:13.260> piston<00:03:13.650> door<00:03:13.799> should<00:03:14.010> look

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
with walls your piston door should look

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.590 
with walls your piston door should look
something<00:03:14.459> like<00:03:14.639> this

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.400
