00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and compile is enough for me difficult

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.070

progression<00:00:25.619> isn't<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.099> certainly<00:00:26.310> making

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
progression isn't it I certainly making

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.140 
progression isn't it I certainly making
progress<00:00:26.910> year-on-year<00:00:27.779> oh<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
progress year-on-year oh and you know I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.640 
progress year-on-year oh and you know I
think<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.080> cop<00:00:31.470> they're

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
think if you can do that a cop they're

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
think if you can do that a cop they're
not<00:00:31.800> something<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> build<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
not something to do so I build on and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
not something to do so I build on and
they<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.230> maybe<00:00:34.559> try<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.010> move<00:00:35.130> forward<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they can maybe try and move forward in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.150 
they can maybe try and move forward in
New<00:00:36.570> York<00:00:36.780> oh<00:00:36.989> well<00:00:37.020> tighten<00:00:37.800> them<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:37.920> in

said tell me I'm sure be willing to do
something<00:00:44.160> somewhat<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.879> difficult<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.360> be

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
something somewhat I was difficult to be

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.209 
something somewhat I was difficult to be
juggling<00:00:46.110> resources<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:47.010> you've<00:00:47.129> got

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
juggling resources that when you've got

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.940 
juggling resources that when you've got
those<00:00:47.399> two<00:00:47.640> big<00:00:47.850> targets<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> couple<00:00:48.719> weeks

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
those two big targets in a couple weeks

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
those two big targets in a couple weeks
in<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.219> way<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.199> for

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
in what way in you know you go for

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
in what way in you know you go for
tomorrow<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.980> three<00:00:53.250> points<00:00:53.579> give<00:00:54.000> our

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
tomorrow and three points give our

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
tomorrow and three points give our
Wembley<00:00:54.539> well<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.230> they've<00:00:55.620> nearly<00:00:55.829> got

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
Wembley well I think they've nearly got

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
Wembley well I think they've nearly got
fourth<00:00:56.520> place<00:00:56.640> I've<00:00:57.030> certainly<00:00:57.329> got<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
fourth place I've certainly got the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
fourth place I've certainly got the
place<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> top<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> shoe<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.980> think

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
place in the top for a shoe and I think

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
place in the top for a shoe and I think
it'll<00:00:59.730> probably<00:00:59.969> hard<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> night<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it'll probably hard for that night to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
it'll probably hard for that night to
help<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.800> them<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.010> they'll<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.399> they'll

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
help for them and they'll get they'll

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
help for them and they'll get they'll
get<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> cup<00:01:03.510> final<00:01:03.899> next<00:01:04.049> week<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
get the cup final next week as well so

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130 
get the cup final next week as well so
but<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:05.909> why<00:01:06.090> they've<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> big<00:01:06.930> squad

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
but that's why they've got a big squad

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
but that's why they've got a big squad
have<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.560> lots<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.310> foils<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.060> it's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
have got lots of foils they can use it's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.630 
have got lots of foils they can use it's
not<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.479> they're<00:01:09.810> short<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.590> players<00:01:10.770> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
not as if they're short on players in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.240 
not as if they're short on players in
terms<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.500> record<00:01:13.500> against<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:16.009> we<00:01:17.009> always

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
terms of record against them we always

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
terms of record against them we always
hope<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.640> keep<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.479> nobody

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
hope we keep it going because nobody

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.660 
hope we keep it going because nobody
want<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.920> want<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.130> finish<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> season

want you we want to finish the season
strongly<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.270> went<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.439> he<00:01:22.530> finishes

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
strongly we went to the one he finishes

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.890 
strongly we went to the one he finishes
high<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.189> knowing<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.850> how<00:01:24.390> important

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
high up knowing as we can how important

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
high up knowing as we can how important
is<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.680> mean<00:01:26.090> your<00:01:27.090> league

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
is that because I mean your league

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
is that because I mean your league
position<00:01:27.450> obviously<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:28.220> come<00:01:29.220> naturally

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
position obviously will come naturally

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
position obviously will come naturally
but<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> mean<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.119> terms<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.509> momentum<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.259> next

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
but I mean in terms of momentum for next

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
but I mean in terms of momentum for next
season

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
season

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
season
but<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.420> had<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.780> momentum<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
but we had a lot of momentum and the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.020 
but we had a lot of momentum and the
last<00:01:34.770> season<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> doesn't<00:01:35.850> take<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.000> great

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
deal gonna start this one so I but the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
deal gonna start this one so I but the
fact<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> matter<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.079> when

your<00:01:40.350> next<00:01:40.560> game<00:01:40.710> no<00:01:40.920> matter<00:01:41.070> who<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.399> play

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
your next game no matter who you play

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.130 
your next game no matter who you play
the<00:01:41.850> next<00:01:42.000> game<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.360> always<00:01:42.570> important<00:01:43.020> one

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the next game is always important one

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
the next game is always important one
and<00:01:43.530> we'll<00:01:43.710> try<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> next<00:01:44.399> game<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
and we'll try and when the next game and
there<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.320> they're<00:01:46.649> more

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
there if we can do that they're more

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
there if we can do that they're more
work<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.280> after<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.789> well<00:01:47.970> your

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
work to the one after that as well your

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.940 
work to the one after that as well your
fans<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.899> particular<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.439> guess<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
fans in particular I guess because of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.070 
fans in particular I guess because of
the<00:01:50.130> fun<00:01:50.340> since<00:01:50.700> you've<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.689> morning

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
the fun since you've got this morning

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.570 
the fun since you've got this morning
you<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.320> wonder<00:01:52.560> whether<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:53.220> likes<00:01:53.399> about

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
you just wonder whether they likes about

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.249 
you just wonder whether they likes about
your<00:01:53.820> players<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
your players to be really up for this to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.190 
your players to be really up for this to
the<00:01:55.320> game<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.610> an<00:01:56.700> extra<00:01:57.030> incentive<00:01:57.200> why

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the game is that an extra incentive why

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.779 
the game is that an extra incentive why
because<00:01:58.679> they've<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:59.009> more<00:01:59.159> money<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.580> boys

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
because they've got more money the boys

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.999 
because they've got more money the boys
are<00:01:59.939> built<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:00.600> enough<00:02:00.869> no<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
pressures well it does because know

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.220 
pressures well it does because know
people<00:02:36.060> at<00:02:36.150> yourself<00:02:36.450> had<00:02:36.600> already<00:02:36.720> seen<00:02:37.109> oh

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
people at yourself had already seen oh

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.300 
people at yourself had already seen oh
do<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.530> they're<00:02:37.769> doing<00:02:37.799> well<00:02:38.100> enough

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
do you think they're doing well enough

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.069 
do you think they're doing well enough
going<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.670> finish<00:02:38.940> fourth<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.450> being<00:02:39.720> an<00:02:39.810> FA

going to finish fourth and being an FA
Cup<00:02:40.260> final<00:02:40.579> so<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:42.840> that's<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.410> pressure

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
Cup final so that that's the pressure

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.380
