00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.080
 so welcome please rest 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 We start with our press conference 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.990
 an intense football evening will be 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.389
 The End 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 with our bka I welcome the two 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.199
 trainer front right heartily the first 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.199
 The name of the guest will be Herr Axel 90 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.289
 intense minutes over an hour in 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.420
 not counting at the end 2 3 from the view of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.930
 Fortuna I ask you for your conclusion to the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.779
 game 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.279
 yes thank you very much for all the emotionality 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.809
 first used congratulation 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.070
 Ingolstadt for the three points and too 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.300
 This game hurt a lot because of me 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.800
 think we have more than one point here 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 even deserved to have due 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.469
 a tactically very good performance 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.559
 the defense work is forward 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.850
 then went to the red just something 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.160
 less, nevertheless, we have one 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.879
 then you can put two pin pricks 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.890
 Still 2 1 in the lead think that we out 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.180
 add to the game out of the ingolstadt 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.090
 all field superiority itself 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.810
 Of course we had little allowed 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.030
 have you nothing and get it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.530
 also not regulated that we at 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
 standards station are wide awake that we 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.750
 because in front of the enemy ants and must be so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 two bitter hits 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.590
 the bitter thing is that then the second 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 what the third goal of hers 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.090
 location leads in the sixth minute of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.000
 replay time falls 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.799
 why we are here five minutes today 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.710
 I did not know playing time 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.329
 Honestly I have seen a game 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.979
 which actually ran smoothly for us 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.360
 our physis were once in the square 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.180
 therefore, it was my opinion 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.640
 no big occasion 45 minutes 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.430
 give extra time 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.259
 so it is all the more bitter for us 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.460
 but as we say nonetheless 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.509
 Can work properly on the runs 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.450
 militant performance on the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 defense tactical performance already 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.500
 be proud of and therefore do this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.200
 defeat hurt but we look 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.879
 further that we play it in five 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 as many points as possible with the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.349
 attitude of today with the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.330
 Defense or football I just got that 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.920
 First half we'll give you three four 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.690
 We had good chances 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.660
 played through but fast 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.540
 have built up and then I am 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.209
 do not worry about the last games 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.420
 thank you very much thanks to the axa ralf 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.920
 please summarize the game first 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.209
 thank you for the congratulations 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.519
 I believe we have today was the day 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.799
 I 've already been there in the stadium 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.730
 said a player puts that 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.459
 you probably will not be that fast 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.260
 forgets 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.920
 We really have a stroke today 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.400
 have gone the madness 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.269
 shoot first half-time if eleven- meter 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.459
 finally get one and then 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.560
 we close it and and almost give 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.420
 in the collision up to 1 0 1 behind 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.819
 I had to go there half past time 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.110
 shake and try your head free 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.480
 because that was of course already 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.769
 hard we really tried ours 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.420
 plan to lay out for the second 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.760
 half time how we wanted to tackle it 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.350
 have come a lot outside 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.880
 quickly then more offensive forces 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.310
 then moritz pretty early brought toni then 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.690
 put on to the right for tobi and made 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.090
 a towering gate just like us 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.329
 know from the turn of 16 a 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.500
 compensation one must know is has 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.109
 now the successful game completely closed 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.389
 We have two residues left 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.790
 caught up and then again 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.769
 conceded at home but me 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.920
 We believe we always believed in it 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.810
 that it is still possible even after the 12th 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.340
 that does not fall into the trap of course 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.560
 may but we are then just full 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.120
 risk gone and the opponent make 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.090
 once again from the gate and and does that 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.920
 gate and on the other hand we had 34 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.420
 shootings we were really in a lot 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.859
 The box then tried with others 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.630
 mijatovic again a great player 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.239
 bring in the same two 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.709
 had huge opportunities and that too 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.500
 I worked very well we give 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.579
 a lot of risk today but it is not 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.139
 of course that's me then 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.660
 rewarded in the way and me 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.739
 I already said the moment when you 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.570
 then really the winning goal yet 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.789
 make in the 96th 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.800
 minute that is 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.979
 indescribable as all the dams break 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.699
 there it is like the explosion in the 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.259
 stadium there is just crazy 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.240
 emotional moment and that's what you do 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.069
 actually the job and i can only 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 Congratulate everyone as 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.970

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.740
 Stadium was because such a game get 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.020
 you do not often see and was natural 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.620
 It is very important for us that we are three today 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.819
 points have then brought these many 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.250
