00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.950

 You just want to look who does it. 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.240
 success in the makeup of our 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.700
 fear of losing hair brushes man

 all that I like to use I always use 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.210
 It's time to take off makeup so it's a 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.189
 surprise where fortunately I withdraw 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.520
 I said I'm going to leave a way well, there's no way 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.530
 easy to conquer the 18 others shampoo 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.159
 I like to take off the blush mascara is 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.319
 I love the practical handkerchiefs by 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.799
 Watcher then you like to make a 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.980
 thermal campaign to give a refreshed 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.530
 here too it is corrective that I use 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.540
 so lopes fact my creams of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.989
 coconut then the anp is very easy 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.700
 Something else I liked a lot 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.590
 were the labels that the nasa put 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.319
 that she took it and put the money in 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.420
 everything is also easy because of the last 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.880
 Sometimes people do not even remember where 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.360
 tava there is that's here also O 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.129
 machines that taboo and is put a few years 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.730
 can leave the stock 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.730
 the samples 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.269
 powder 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.820
 here's one thing here 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.830
 I tried to mix the segment here 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.030
 the body of business that I like 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.760
 pass but she gives us snacks 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:25.240
 the Syrians with their necks all in one 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.240
 Lixinho to stay the same thing 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.860
 Well, more or less like I was anat. 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.240
 paid and actually works. 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.240
 overbilling was great 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.220
 there is the part of the environment that is also 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.080
 super difficult so one of the most 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.920
 difficult to keep the map and we always 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:06.910
 end up catching many editing issue 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.910
 too much too much and that way 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.400
 cool that has a part i have here 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.130
 in the other our part not only for you 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.560
 it's these little parties that you keep 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.209
 inside the basket you do in all 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.180
 guarantees that the hair part inside 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.919
 watching everything lose hair here from 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.870
 Suddenly until you want to see you need 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.510
 stay down were found at home 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.740
 watching the next sink and see what 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:37.100
 you will want to choose to use the same 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:42.260
 It's what I say, you have the chance to 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.820
 match repellent and a general coconut and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.360
 stayed here in body 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:53.090
 here in Solar and also the protector 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.830
 sunscreen and down here is one thing 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.960
 which I like to do that is the stock 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.450
 of children is what you end up traveling 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.610
 through suddenly protector like 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.440
 do toothbrush and I like to leave 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.660
 Here a part of my bathroom because it 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.539
 I let them each day open their one 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:15.880
 brush so staying here does not run 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:20.889
 risk of showing the part of the baskets 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:26.780
 also that of the 50 most things eh eh 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:30.650
 little ones to stay in soups is 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.510
 everything to organize the next one went to the house 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.139
 and that's pretty cool too have not you 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.620
 gives a nice tip because you do not 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.160
 Leave a little chip you know you are 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.150

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.030
 the streets near the fia because then like me 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.200

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.570
 dirty towel 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.090
 so I is easier to change 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.070

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.520

 skin that are the moisturizers 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.660
 I always leave here to train 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:14.120

 she always thinks so yourself 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:38.870
 without letting the bag pass in the knee like this 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:41.450
