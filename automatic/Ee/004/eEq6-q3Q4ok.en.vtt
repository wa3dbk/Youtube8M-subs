00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.929
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.469
 a new video on lego mindstorms 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.139
 service 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
 Today, it's about how you feel about 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.770
 a program if you have something 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.350
 programmed that the rear under the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.510
 turquoise which means own blocks 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.750
 where you create a blog here so well 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.310
 if you have some of the processes that your whole 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 many individual blocks together 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 has done and that is always on 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.780
 Some places should be repeated 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 then just include your own blog 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.670
 relatively good because you just blog 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.250
 one only purely natural I have 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.540
 also prepared an example 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.160
 considering the blog just one has 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.780
 then stop the whole complex program 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 what you have just written what stop 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.530
 again and we should be repeated 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.129
 in the program they are really only 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.379
 if such a blog is worth it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.629
 if you keep some things several times 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.420
 So you have to use motor here 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.520
 processes or intestinal surgery I know that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.670
 I have one for that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.290
 well a little bit programmed what 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.490
 that is still to come later 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.650
 videos know what it all here for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:19.890
 Blocker in this video is about it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.909
 that I can leave my engine here 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.950
 occur when here and you have to 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.960
 always reprogram each time 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 vermont have it in the program because 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.079
 First, for example, now that the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.079
 mother should turn to the right 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.259
 which always keeps me this right 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.299
 need if he stops with the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.119
 small motor if you have a control 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.710
 have a front plan two wheels are yes 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.869
 that will not really be the first time 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
 but you need that more often 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.259
 such a blog then you have to just above 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.729
 under tools, click that 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.430
 not so good now but looks now 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.290
 do it again and then go under your own 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.939
 Create blocks you had before 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.380
 remained selected name of the blog stream 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.160
 Enter with for example just so tired 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 then we do not really have to 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.380
 description is not so 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.920
 useful and then just such a courage 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.580
 in the archive, whether it the image as 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.280
 can you really take everything completely 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.460
 matter then create finished 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.500
 then we'll see right away that he's here 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.170
 a horse has added blog under 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.610
 instead of what we had before it means 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.440
 now we have in rheydt block and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.480
 You can also do this under your own blocks 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.310
 Ride blog too often we want to pull in 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.780
 wanted in this blog is just that in it 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.420
 what I programmed him or you 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.820
 showed and yes that was actually 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.440
 first the video to own blog 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.730
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.770
 if yes then load thumbs up and 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.590
 Subscribe or watch my mine 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.090
 old videos and then we'll meet 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.090
 until the next video show
