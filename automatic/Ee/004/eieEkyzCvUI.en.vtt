00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.230
 and his horror story 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.700

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.540
 Hi, I'm the lady and I'm going to 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.880
 tell them a horror story all 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.960
 started that day when I worked at 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.960
 the clinic tunisia pay 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.600
 Turull was early morning and was very 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.910
 tired I went to the armchair 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.910
 a little when suddenly 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 ah 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.440
 priced 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.440
 the East 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.830
 elevator was desperate I did not know nor 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.830
 where to picket 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.970
 opened on the 16th floor 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.520
 has all the promises 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.400
 and suddenly they started at moments 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.400
 strangers 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.689
 got a moment 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.880
 and I ran terrified and God followed me 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.170
 I followed 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.329
 I return to help what fear 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.740
 on the floor because the elevator no longer what 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.930
 I saw 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.329
 but for my misfortune I blocked myself in 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.329
 2000 torsion runs and charity 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.690
 how can they escape from there terrified and 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.670
 since then I have never turned to 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.770
 stop at that place just to see it 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.490
 I even shivered when it happened to be 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.490
 head and the 11th floor was closed 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.470
 brightness 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.500
 Well yes I was very scared Mr. ChabÃ¡n 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.140
 you would feel if you look suddenly 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.470
 you do not even think here that you're going to 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.830
 move to two your only idea is to rest 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.130
 a little bit and which suddenly something 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.060
 hears 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.360
 please no it will not have been that the body 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.260
 because he was not dead or was it a thing 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.930
 it was something that I or he oppressed me 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.010
 urge and I just social I was 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.610
 desperate I wanted to get out 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.680
 but they grabbed her 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.000
 it did not fall on top it was a something 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 but something the foundations as I could think 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.070
 It was obvious that I was already scared of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.780
 what I wanted him to leave to tell 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 someone to reassure me because the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.060
 true but this was before or after 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.710
 world war z no no I do not know when 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.020
 it would be the world war z but after 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.510
 I've been around for a while now 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.220
 happened and the truth that scared me a lot 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.590
 but everything that happened 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.170
 make an account like that thing that I 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.990
 I felt in my body and where I was running and 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.270
 everything or I still felt that thing 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.040
 pretend that I was terrified 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.030
 because I knew there was nobody 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.030
 well, very good
