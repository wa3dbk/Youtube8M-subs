00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
ok today we're going to go over

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.640 
ok today we're going to go over
how<00:00:17.480> to<00:00:17.539> do<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.710> Choya<00:00:19.490> blanks<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:21.410> first

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
how to do the Choya blanks the first

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.230 
how to do the Choya blanks the first
thing<00:00:21.830> you<00:00:21.949> want<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:22.189> do<00:00:22.369> when<00:00:22.550> you<00:00:22.669> get<00:00:22.910> it<00:00:23.060> is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
thing you want to do when you get it is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.080 
thing you want to do when you get it is
look<00:00:23.539> at<00:00:23.900> both<00:00:24.320> ends<00:00:24.769> you<00:00:24.830> can<00:00:25.099> see<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:25.849> Choya

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
look at both ends you can see the Choya

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.900 
look at both ends you can see the Choya
on<00:00:26.360> this<00:00:26.570> end<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:27.079> cannot<00:00:28.039> see<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.550> Choya

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
on this end you cannot see the Choya

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.510 
on this end you cannot see the Choya
on<00:00:29.060> this<00:00:29.449> end<00:00:29.720> very<00:00:29.960> clearly<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.340> first

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
on this end very clearly so the first

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.340 
on this end very clearly so the first
thing<00:00:31.730> I'm<00:00:31.849> going<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.119> do<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.419> cut<00:00:32.660> off<00:00:32.840> just<00:00:33.140> a

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
thing I'm going to do is cut off just a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.759 
thing I'm going to do is cut off just a
little<00:00:33.739> bit<00:00:33.949> of<00:00:34.220> this<00:00:34.879> blank<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.320> I<00:00:36.530> can

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
little bit of this blank so that I can

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.979 
little bit of this blank so that I can
see<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.129> Choya<00:00:37.370> clearly<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.420> will<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.780> that<00:00:38.930> on

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
see the Choya clearly I will do that on

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.630 
see the Choya clearly I will do that on
my<00:00:39.320> bandsaw

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.160 

okay<00:00:43.640> I've<00:00:43.790> cut<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:44.449> can<00:00:44.690> see<00:00:44.900> where<00:00:45.079> the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
okay I've cut it so I can see where the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.549 
okay I've cut it so I can see where the
tria

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
tria

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.119 
tria
is<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.159> now<00:00:46.940> I've<00:00:47.210> make<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.510> circle<00:00:48.140> that

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
is and now I've make a circle that

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.670 
is and now I've make a circle that
touches<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.940> bottom<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.629> each<00:00:51.109> of<00:00:51.440> these

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
touches the bottom of each of these

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.670 
touches the bottom of each of these
little<00:00:51.949> pieces<00:00:52.219> of<00:00:52.489> Choya<00:00:53.199> then<00:00:54.199> after<00:00:54.559> I've

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
little pieces of Choya then after I've

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.680 
little pieces of Choya then after I've
made<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:55.160> circle<00:00:55.609> it<00:00:55.730> gives<00:00:55.940> me<00:00:56.090> an<00:00:56.180> idea<00:00:56.600> of

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
made that circle it gives me an idea of

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.959 
made that circle it gives me an idea of
where<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.410> center<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:58.280> put<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> little<00:00:58.699> mark

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
where the center is I put a little mark

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.080 
where the center is I put a little mark
in<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.300> center<00:00:59.329> I<00:00:59.840> do<00:01:00.500> this<00:01:00.769> on<00:01:01.010> both<00:01:01.309> ends<00:01:01.940> of

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
in the center I do this on both ends of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.270 
in the center I do this on both ends of
the<00:01:02.300> blank<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.109> know<00:01:03.289> approximately<00:01:03.710> where

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the blank so I know approximately where

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.779 
the blank so I know approximately where
the<00:01:04.309> center<00:01:04.759> is<00:01:04.789> on<00:01:05.179> both<00:01:05.509> ends<00:01:06.250> now<00:01:07.250> I'm<00:01:07.490> going

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
the center is on both ends now I'm going

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.560 
the center is on both ends now I'm going
to<00:01:07.910> take<00:01:08.149> a<00:01:08.420> spur<00:01:08.929> Drive<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.740> set<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:10.880> up<00:01:11.030> into

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
to take a spur Drive and set it up into

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.859 
to take a spur Drive and set it up into
the<00:01:11.780> lathe<00:01:12.350> with<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.250> as<00:01:13.490> my<00:01:13.520> headstock<00:01:14.509> and

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
the lathe with this as my headstock and

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.139 
the lathe with this as my headstock and
a<00:01:15.440> normal<00:01:15.830> 60-degree<00:01:16.460> center<00:01:16.789> as<00:01:16.970> the

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
a normal 60-degree center as the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.810 
a normal 60-degree center as the
tailstock<00:01:20.229> as<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:21.530> can<00:01:21.740> see<00:01:22.009> when<00:01:22.280> I<00:01:22.310> put<00:01:22.610> that

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
tailstock as you can see when I put that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.170 
tailstock as you can see when I put that
in<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.329> is<00:01:23.570> not<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.200> center<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.250> plane<00:01:25.579> it

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
in it is not the center of the plane it

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.390 
in it is not the center of the plane it
is<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.600> center<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.409> tria<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:28.280> we're

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
is the center of the tria that we're

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.780 
is the center of the tria that we're
working<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.290> obviously<00:01:30.950> significantly

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
working on it is obviously significantly

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.450 
working on it is obviously significantly
off<00:01:32.090> center<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.810> blank<00:01:33.049> I'll<00:01:33.740> now<00:01:33.979> turn<00:01:34.040> it

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
off center of the blank I'll now turn it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.760 
off center of the blank I'll now turn it
so<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.790> becomes<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:36.049> center<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.619> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
so that that becomes the center of the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.149 
so that that becomes the center of the
blank<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:39.159> couple<00:01:40.159> of<00:01:40.280> caveats<00:01:40.579> to<00:01:41.240> be<00:01:41.360> aware<00:01:41.630> of

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
blank a couple of caveats to be aware of

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.670 
blank a couple of caveats to be aware of
first<00:01:43.159> when<00:01:43.729> you're<00:01:43.909> putting<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.570> spur<00:01:45.290> Center

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
first when you're putting a spur Center

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.240 
first when you're putting a spur Center
into<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.790> piece<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.119> plastic<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:48.020> will<00:01:48.920> find

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
into a piece of plastic you will find

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.330 
into a piece of plastic you will find
that<00:01:49.549> if<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.270> push<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.869> real<00:01:51.290> hard<00:01:51.590> or<00:01:51.890> bang

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
that if you push on it real hard or bang

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.340 
that if you push on it real hard or bang
it<00:01:52.579> in<00:01:52.759> or<00:01:53.000> whatever<00:01:53.299> with<00:01:53.689> any<00:01:53.869> kind<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.229> a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
it in or whatever with any kind of a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.120 
it in or whatever with any kind of a
tool<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:55.340> will<00:01:55.460> probably<00:01:55.729> crack<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.689> plastic

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
tool you will probably crack the plastic

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.069 
tool you will probably crack the plastic
so<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.280> easiest<00:01:58.579> way<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.909> do<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.780> just

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
so the easiest way to do this is to just

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.679 
so the easiest way to do this is to just
barely<00:02:00.560> touch<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.369> then<00:02:02.000> use<00:02:02.210> your<00:02:02.450> tail

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
barely touch it and then use your tail

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.480 
barely touch it and then use your tail
stock<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.259> come<00:02:03.439> up<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.710> do<00:02:03.799> it<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.219> enough

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
stock and come up and do it just enough

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.880 
stock and come up and do it just enough
pressure<00:02:04.789> that<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:05.810> will<00:02:05.960> actually<00:02:06.079> continue

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
pressure that it will actually continue

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.490 
pressure that it will actually continue
to<00:02:06.920> turn<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.610> not<00:02:08.149> stall<00:02:08.600> out<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:09.049> you<00:02:09.229> try<00:02:09.440> to

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
to turn and not stall out as you try to

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.640 
to turn and not stall out as you try to
turn<00:02:09.829> it<00:02:10.120> so<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.150> think<00:02:11.540> we're<00:02:11.810> at<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.140> point

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
turn it so I think we're at that point

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.190 
turn it so I think we're at that point
let's<00:02:13.070> try<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.400> out

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
let's try it out

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:44.960 
let's try it out
grab<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.069> grab<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.000> tool<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.900> turn<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.530> speed<00:02:19.100> up

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.170 

and<00:02:46.769> continuing<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:48.010> tighten<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.670> tailstock

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
and continuing to tighten the tailstock

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.589 
and continuing to tighten the tailstock
each<00:02:49.780> time<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.440> stalls<00:02:50.860> out<00:02:51.390> because<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
each time that stalls out because the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.770 
each time that stalls out because the
headstock<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.590> at<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.190> same<00:02:54.430> time<00:02:54.819> drilling

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
headstock is at the same time drilling

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.930 
headstock is at the same time drilling
that<00:02:55.930> hole<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.470> farther<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.129> farther<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.879> you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
that hole in farther and farther so you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.170 
that hole in farther and farther so you
just<00:02:58.209> want<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.480> go<00:02:58.569> in<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.840> touch<00:02:59.140> each<00:02:59.530> time

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
just want to go in a touch each time

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.000 
just want to go in a touch each time
until<00:03:01.180> finally<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.810> rest<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> Spurs<00:03:02.590> will

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
until finally the rest of the Spurs will

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.430 
until finally the rest of the Spurs will
touch<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:04.799> then<00:03:05.799> you've<00:03:06.069> got<00:03:06.340> Drive<00:03:07.230> takes<00:03:08.230> a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
touch and then you've got Drive takes a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:17.510 
touch and then you've got Drive takes a
while<00:03:08.590> but<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.069> not<00:03:09.280> difficult

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.920 

I'm<00:03:18.520> not<00:03:18.700> trying<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.090> turn<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.420> pen<00:03:19.630> out<00:03:19.810> of

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
I'm not trying to turn the pen out of

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.980 
I'm not trying to turn the pen out of
this<00:03:20.140> I'm<00:03:20.350> only<00:03:20.530> trying<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.010> turn<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.400> round

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
this I'm only trying to turn it round

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.360 
this I'm only trying to turn it round
when<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.290> take<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.910> fairly<00:03:24.910> small<00:03:25.360> amount<00:03:25.420> just

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
when I take a fairly small amount just

00:03:26.370 --> 00:04:35.189 
when I take a fairly small amount just
until<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.520> get<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.880> round

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.499 

okay<00:04:35.949> that's<00:04:36.189> actually<00:04:36.729> ready<00:04:36.999> to<00:04:37.090> drill<00:04:37.539> now

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
okay that's actually ready to drill now

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.659 
okay that's actually ready to drill now
okay<00:04:40.509> the<00:04:40.659> lathe<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:40.870> now<00:04:41.319> prepared<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.129> do<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
okay the lathe is now prepared to do the

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.730 
okay the lathe is now prepared to do the
drilling<00:04:43.060> as<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.870> can<00:04:44.050> see<00:04:44.229> I've<00:04:44.379> put<00:04:44.409> the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
drilling as you can see I've put the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.689 
drilling as you can see I've put the
chai<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:44.949> blank<00:04:45.310> into<00:04:45.999> my<00:04:46.419> scroll<00:04:47.110> Chuck<00:04:47.139> and

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
chai a blank into my scroll Chuck and

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.309 
chai a blank into my scroll Chuck and
tightened<00:04:48.699> it<00:04:48.819> up<00:04:48.939> and<00:04:49.240> then<00:04:49.659> this<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.080> ten

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
tightened it up and then this is a ten

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.890 
tightened it up and then this is a ten
and<00:04:50.409> a<00:04:50.499> half<00:04:50.620> millimeter<00:04:51.400> drill<00:04:51.699> bit<00:04:51.939> and<00:04:52.659> we

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
and a half millimeter drill bit and we

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.959 
and a half millimeter drill bit and we
have<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.349> Jacob's<00:04:53.830> Chuck<00:04:54.099> here<00:04:54.460> which<00:04:54.639> we<00:04:54.819> can

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
have the Jacob's Chuck here which we can

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.869 
have the Jacob's Chuck here which we can
control<00:04:55.419> with<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.340> hand<00:04:57.340> crank

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
control with the hand crank

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.820 
control with the hand crank
that's<00:04:58.120> off-camera<00:04:58.719> that<00:04:58.900> way<00:05:01.469> let's<00:05:02.469> turn<00:05:02.680> it

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
that's off-camera that way let's turn it

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:42.700 
that's off-camera that way let's turn it
on<00:05:02.949> at<00:05:03.219> low<00:05:03.430> speed

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.280 

fill<00:05:43.370> in<00:05:43.550> about<00:05:43.670> halfway<00:05:44.600> release<00:05:45.020> the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
fill in about halfway release the

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.410 
fill in about halfway release the
tailstock<00:05:45.680> take<00:05:46.220> it<00:05:46.370> out<00:05:46.520> so<00:05:46.850> if<00:05:46.910> this<00:05:47.120> can

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
tailstock take it out so if this can

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.390 
tailstock take it out so if this can
cool<00:05:47.780> for<00:05:48.290> a<00:05:48.320> period<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.740> time<00:05:48.950> while<00:05:49.220> you're

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
cool for a period of time while you're

00:05:49.400 --> 00:06:01.939 
cool for a period of time while you're
backing<00:05:49.820> off<00:05:50.000> the<00:05:50.330> tailstock<00:05:51.260> again

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.219 

Pusha<00:06:02.949> them<00:06:03.309> -<00:06:03.610> where<00:06:03.759> is<00:06:03.909> going<00:06:04.389> ended<00:06:04.930> and

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
Pusha them - where is going ended and

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.339 
Pusha them - where is going ended and
then<00:06:06.099> be<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.520> little<00:06:06.639> bit<00:06:07.029> slower<00:06:07.360> at<00:06:07.779> this<00:06:08.050> time

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
then be a little bit slower at this time

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:10.110 
then be a little bit slower at this time
because<00:06:08.650> you're<00:06:09.039> trying<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.520> go<00:06:09.699> through<00:06:09.969> the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
because you're trying to go through the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.749 
because you're trying to go through the
other<00:06:10.270> end<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:11.830> don't<00:06:12.189> want<00:06:12.460> to<00:06:12.610> go

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
other end and you don't want to go

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.820 
other end and you don't want to go
through<00:06:12.999> -<00:06:13.240> real<00:06:13.449> fast<00:06:13.809> and<00:06:14.080> blow<00:06:14.409> out<00:06:14.620> the

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
through - real fast and blow out the

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.469 
through - real fast and blow out the
other<00:06:14.949> end<00:06:15.219> so<00:06:15.610> if<00:06:15.669> you<00:06:15.759> just<00:06:15.939> take<00:06:16.120> it<00:06:16.180> slow

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
other end so if you just take it slow

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:29.439 
other end so if you just take it slow
and<00:06:16.629> easy<00:06:16.719> it'll<00:06:17.169> work<00:06:17.409> out<00:06:17.620> fine

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.020 

okay<00:06:30.449> I'm<00:06:30.629> now<00:06:30.810> through<00:06:31.319> the<00:06:31.470> blank<00:06:31.849> and<00:06:32.849> I

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
okay I'm now through the blank and I

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.890 
okay I'm now through the blank and I
just<00:06:33.270> released<00:06:33.690> this<00:06:34.250> pull<00:06:35.250> it<00:06:35.370> back

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
just released this pull it back

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:48.529 
just released this pull it back
turn<00:06:36.900> off<00:06:37.110> the<00:06:37.319> scroll<00:06:37.889> turn<00:06:38.460> off<00:06:38.610> the<00:06:39.560> lathe

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.119
