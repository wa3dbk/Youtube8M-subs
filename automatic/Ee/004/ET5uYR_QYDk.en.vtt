00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.150
 she tries violent it's the scene 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.030
 four hectares young people get 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.280
 find for number 2 of tutorials 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.900
 home and this time see how 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.310
 finally how to make a mill 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.480
 So here are the first episodes 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.190
 drop off on farms 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.770
 so here is the mill in itself 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.870
 seeing that we are in you house this 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.250
 mill is a house at the foot 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.250
 perfectly habitable 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:42.020
 but on the other hand the second floor end 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.790
 in the attic there is more brothel like 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.410
 in a mill than in a house 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.530
 So here we go right away 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.520
 passed to the realization of it 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.730
 so here we are for the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.760
 realization of this mill so everything 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.920
 first you need to create a round I 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.890
 know that it can hinder you but 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.270
 16th for the cut 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.560
 no i say yeah that's okay maybe you 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.100
 hamper montfort makes sure he does not 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.950
 not there you do 5 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.740
 then two waited here that was it was 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:19.340
 the better you do 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.020
 2 1 2 1 2 and fifth to here is the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.400
 infinite loop them 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.650
 so here you do your base 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:33.290
 then you come to expose your buses on 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.300
 three of huy 3.46 I am evil 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.369
 it's shit so here you come 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.750
 put your goals anywhere in the corners 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:46.160
 once upon a time these effect you 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.600
 could so could fill with bricks 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.600
 always seen that we stay in the spirit of 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.190
 the farm and that for me on a farm 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.350
 there is brick so our hearts 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.539
 then you just ask your motives for 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.649
 windows that I do it like that 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.630
 after you do as you want 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.819
 once you're there you'll have 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.369
 do that you can come back 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:13.430
 your two- year-old layer had two buses 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.730
 usual and once you get but 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.209
 your buch layer you just drop 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.819
 stairs to the place like this is 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.340
 so in one you do in 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.800
 so that it does not make stairs 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.050
 in angle stylus you do that especially 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.090
 the turn it will be my for the first 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.860
 floor so that's it for the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.950
 first misfire and the second floor is 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.390
 a copy paste from the first then you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.160
 do the number of tasks you 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.769
 want and then that's it for the 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.250
 roof finally here is after you ask your 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.069
 I can express myself it's not serious 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.489
 wen you come to ask your thuan that 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:59.989
 it's the same thing as the tasks of the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.170
 down so finally you do your thing to 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.130
 the usual so you go around and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.040
 I'm not going to do it because it's a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.840
 not long and that it took again later in 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.010
 the angles you come to deposit as early as 2000 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.209
 slab like these we go everywhere up and 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.049
 to prevail dominated there you come there 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.900
 drop tubes like this after 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.430
 you ride your roof the way the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.549
 more normal possible a day in 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.560
 england and once it's going to get 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.640
 touch down you continue in half 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.860
 slab the rest of the whole so I resume 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.720
 once I would have finished stable so that's it 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.400
 the roof I have to finish so this is 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.459
 very simple if you tried the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.639
 technical until the end it should 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.109
 to go quietly normally 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.090
 so there for example makes a little train 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.819
 you put a cube in and out so 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.549
 what this is a kind of pyramid 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.829
 above at the end 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.139
 nothing complicated then you but 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.090
 pfff you tell me what you come 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:07.700
 to build yes I know I'm boring 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.700
 it's okay once you've got 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:19.359
 that you fucking shit I would have 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.169
 your mind you do exactly this 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.830
 that I am doing I 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.300
 can not explain it but you 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.740
 so are a kind of skylight for 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:34.240
 to come lets appear the the receptacle 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.120
 mill hashish I do not know 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.800
 the exact terms 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.220
 well, you do something like that 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.610
 and it will be like that, so these are the 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.280
 mill blades this is you do is 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.060
 spent as much as you want on the same 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.060
 ground a little bit too much 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.690
 then I came to do 4 like these 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:02.500
 is then you go up your pale like 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:06.699
 that up to where you want and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:12.729
 you simply cover with marble 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:16.210
 the turn and it will be good for your 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.340
 I'm doing this on both sides 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.139
 it will be my wish early on for this 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.669
 episode 2 of homemade tutorials I hope that 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.740
 I liked you, I really hope that it 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.780
 helped you this is the case do not hesitate to 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.340
 put one ever video to subscribe 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.419
 it would make me super fun so vologe has 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.330
 Nothing else to say 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.400
