review of the Apple Thunderbolt Gigabit
Ethernet<00:00:10.170> adapter<00:00:10.980> now<00:00:11.190> if<00:00:11.849> you've<00:00:12.059> got<00:00:12.090> a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
Ethernet adapter now if you've got a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.879 
Ethernet adapter now if you've got a
macbook<00:00:12.720> air<00:00:12.930> you're<00:00:13.139> probably<00:00:13.380> aware<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
macbook air you're probably aware that

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.580 
macbook air you're probably aware that
the<00:00:14.010> MacBook<00:00:14.460> Air<00:00:14.730> does<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.809> include<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the MacBook Air does not include a

the MacBook Air does not include a
built-in<00:00:17.510> Ethernet<00:00:18.510> port<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.340> you're

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
built-in Ethernet port so if you're

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.060 
built-in Ethernet port so if you're
going<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.670> connect<00:00:20.940> your<00:00:21.090> MacBook<00:00:21.449> Air<00:00:21.660> to

Gigabit Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter is
so<00:01:15.959> let's<00:01:16.139> go<00:01:16.289> into<00:01:16.529> this<00:01:16.649> folder<00:01:17.810> transfer

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so let's go into this folder transfer

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.859 
so let's go into this folder transfer
test<00:01:19.200> folder<00:01:19.789> this<00:01:20.789> folder<00:01:20.849> resides<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.719> my

test folder this folder resides on my

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.649 
test folder this folder resides on my
desktop<00:01:22.259> iMac<00:01:23.060> now<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.209> desktop<00:01:24.599> iMac<00:01:25.109> is<00:01:25.469> a

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
desktop iMac now my desktop iMac is a

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.219 
desktop iMac now my desktop iMac is a
2009<00:01:27.659> model<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.709> does<00:01:28.919> have<00:01:29.159> Gigabit<00:01:29.609> Ethernet

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
2009 model it does have Gigabit Ethernet

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.379 
2009 model it does have Gigabit Ethernet
now<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.529> computer<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.069> MacBook<00:01:32.520> Air<00:01:32.729> 2012

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:33.389 
now this computer is a MacBook Air 2012

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:37.969 
now this computer is a MacBook Air 2012
model<00:01:33.840> most<00:01:34.770> recent<00:01:35.189> release<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.169> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
model most recent release and it you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.909 
model most recent release and it you
know<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.189> 13-inch<00:01:38.789> MacBook<00:01:38.969> so<00:01:39.619> let's<00:01:40.619> drag

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:40.919 
know the 13-inch MacBook so let's drag

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:43.010 
know the 13-inch MacBook so let's drag
this<00:01:41.159> over<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.789> let's<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.479> how<00:01:42.599> long<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
this over and let's see how long it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.199 
this over and let's see how long it
takes

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.959 

so<00:01:48.209> it's<00:01:48.329> copying<00:01:48.719> now<00:01:48.989> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.979> 3.0<00:01:50.669> 3

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
so it's copying now this is 3.0 3

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.139 
so it's copying now this is 3.0 3
gigabytes<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> course<00:01:53.459> is<00:01:53.849> all<00:01:53.999> in

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
gigabytes and this of course is all in

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
gigabytes and this of course is all in
real<00:01:54.359> time<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.929> as<00:01:55.139> we're<00:01:55.319> watching<00:01:55.469> so<00:01:56.039> it's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
real time here as we're watching so it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.749 
real time here as we're watching so it's
already<00:01:56.489> done<00:01:56.700> over<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.090> gig<00:01:57.419> I<00:02:01.249> mean<00:02:02.249> you<00:02:02.369> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
already done over a gig I mean you you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.669 
already done over a gig I mean you you
would<00:02:02.909> think<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.299> Gigabit<00:02:04.079> Ethernet<00:02:04.109> would

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
would think that Gigabit Ethernet would

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.999 
would think that Gigabit Ethernet would
mean<00:02:04.889> every<00:02:05.309> second<00:02:05.819> a<00:02:05.880> gigabyte<00:02:06.299> would<00:02:06.479> pass

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
mean every second a gigabyte would pass

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.740 
mean every second a gigabyte would pass
but<00:02:08.009> that's<00:02:08.159> not<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.579> cat's<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.149> necessarily

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
but that's not the cat's not necessarily

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.039 
but that's not the cat's not necessarily
the<00:02:09.840> case<00:02:10.049> I<00:02:10.259> mean<00:02:10.409> possibly<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:11.719> if<00:02:12.719> someone

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
the case I mean possibly if if someone

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:13.910 
the case I mean possibly if if someone
had<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.379> very

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
had a very

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
had a very
high-end<00:02:14.540> enterprise<00:02:15.540> type<00:02:15.930> network<00:02:16.940> they

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
high-end enterprise type network they

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.270 
high-end enterprise type network they
would<00:02:18.090> likely<00:02:18.330> get<00:02:18.780> faster<00:02:19.680> transmission

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
would likely get faster transmission

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.260 
would likely get faster transmission
rates<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> home<00:02:22.140> network<00:02:22.819> between<00:02:23.819> two
