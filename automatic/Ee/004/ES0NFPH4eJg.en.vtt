was<00:00:27.490> actually<00:00:27.699> a<00:00:27.880> little<00:00:28.029> better<00:00:28.119> than<00:00:28.329> one<00:00:28.449> I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
was actually a little better than one I

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.159 
was actually a little better than one I
had<00:00:28.720> this<00:00:28.960> one's<00:00:29.230> yellow<00:00:29.470> jacket<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.900> has<00:00:32.140> a

had this one's yellow jacket it has a
side<00:00:32.650> tap<00:00:33.070> on<00:00:33.400> it<00:00:33.579> for<00:00:33.850> putting<00:00:34.060> a<00:00:34.239> micron

gauge<00:00:34.989> on<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:37.030> going<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.329> show<00:00:37.540> you<00:00:37.570> how<00:00:38.020> this

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
gauge on I'm going to show you how this

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.040 
gauge on I'm going to show you how this
thing<00:00:38.320> works<00:00:38.950> when<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.910> want<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.300> evacuate<00:00:41.020> a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
thing works when you want to evacuate a

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.350 
thing works when you want to evacuate a
system<00:00:41.710> but<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.800> not<00:00:45.040> real<00:00:45.520> thrilled<00:00:45.550> with

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
system but I'm not real thrilled with

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
system but I'm not real thrilled with
using<00:00:46.900> these<00:00:47.080> things<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:48.840> evacuation<00:00:49.840> because

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
using these things in evacuation because

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
using these things in evacuation because
tools<00:00:51.430> get<00:00:51.760> knocked<00:00:52.030> around<00:00:53.160> throwing<00:00:54.160> around

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
tools get knocked around throwing around

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.160 
tools get knocked around throwing around
gaskets<00:00:56.410> started<00:00:56.740> going<00:00:57.010> bad<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.900> so<00:00:58.900> there's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
gaskets started going bad and so there's

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.930 
gaskets started going bad and so there's
more<00:00:59.440> chances<00:01:00.100> for<00:01:00.160> this<00:01:00.400> thing<00:01:00.610> to<00:01:00.760> leak

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
more chances for this thing to leak

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.229 
more chances for this thing to leak
inside<00:01:01.450> that<00:01:02.140> said<00:01:02.620> it's<00:01:03.070> commonly<00:01:03.700> done<00:01:03.970> and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
inside that said it's commonly done and

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.020 
inside that said it's commonly done and
sometimes<00:01:04.449> I'll<00:01:04.960> use<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.740> too<00:01:06.009> but<00:01:06.880> its

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
sometimes I'll use it too but its

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.560 
sometimes I'll use it too but its
primary<00:01:07.360> function<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:09.070> replace<00:01:09.640> Schrader

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
primary function is to replace Schrader

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.600 
primary function is to replace Schrader
cores<00:01:10.930> without<00:01:11.439> losing<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.070> refrigerant

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
cores without losing the refrigerant

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.850 
cores without losing the refrigerant
charge<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.930> primary<00:01:14.320> thing<00:01:14.710> these

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
charge that's a primary thing these

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.300 
charge that's a primary thing these
things<00:01:15.190> are<00:01:15.340> for<00:01:15.690> now<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:17.640> couple<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.850> things

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.920 

okay<00:01:24.310> there<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.729> Schrader<00:01:25.120> tool<00:01:25.570> right

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
okay there is a Schrader tool right

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.060 
okay there is a Schrader tool right
there<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.720> goes<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:29.940> if<00:01:30.940> I<00:01:31.210> place<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:32.140> in

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
there and it goes in if I place this in

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.500 
there and it goes in if I place this in
like<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:35.370> then<00:01:36.370> it<00:01:36.700> will<00:01:36.909> remove<00:01:37.240> this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
like that then it will remove this

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.380 
like that then it will remove this
Schrader<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:39.310> going<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.549> demonstrate<00:01:39.820> how<00:01:40.360> it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
Schrader I'm going to demonstrate how it

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.690 
Schrader I'm going to demonstrate how it
works<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.960> little<00:01:41.290> bit<00:01:41.500> but<00:01:41.830> what<00:01:42.430> this<00:01:42.640> does

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
works a little bit but what this does

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.810 
works a little bit but what this does
you<00:01:43.299> can<00:01:43.450> see<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.900> Schrader<00:01:44.229> removal<00:01:45.220> tool<00:01:45.490> in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
you can see the Schrader removal tool in

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.410 
you can see the Schrader removal tool in
there<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.950> use<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.580> I<00:01:48.820> pull<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.479> back<00:01:49.840> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
there to use this I pull this back I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.370 
there to use this I pull this back I
close<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.720> valve<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:54.690> then<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.840> just<00:01:56.080> screw

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
close the valve and then I just screw

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.760 
close the valve and then I just screw
this<00:01:56.530> on<00:01:56.770> where<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.310> Schrader<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:58.409> now<00:01:59.409> this

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
this on where the Schrader is now this

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.590 
this on where the Schrader is now this
is<00:02:00.450> tightened<00:02:01.450> down<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.150> want<00:02:04.540> to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
is tightened down and when I want to

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.630 
is tightened down and when I want to
remove<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:05.049> Raider<00:02:05.350> once<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.799> put<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.130> on<00:02:06.369> I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
remove this Raider once I put it on I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.610 
remove this Raider once I put it on I
simply<00:02:07.299> open<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.110> valve<00:02:08.909> push<00:02:09.909> this<00:02:10.209> in

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.510 

you're<00:02:15.519> just<00:02:15.790> unscrewing<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.310> then<00:02:18.310> go

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
you're just unscrewing it and then go

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.830 
you're just unscrewing it and then go
back<00:02:19.000> like<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:20.160> close

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
back like this close

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.220

close the valve and you can remove and
the<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:33.459> tool<00:02:33.700> now<00:02:33.939> because<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.299> valves

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
the the tool now because the valves

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.509 
the the tool now because the valves
closed<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.680> straighter<00:02:35.980> should<00:02:36.219> be<00:02:36.370> on

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
closed and the straighter should be on

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.640 
closed and the straighter should be on
the<00:02:36.640> end<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.510> I'll<00:02:37.659> demonstrate<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:40.650> all

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
the end and I'll demonstrate it all

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.309 
the end and I'll demonstrate it all
right<00:02:42.599> I've<00:02:43.599> got<00:02:43.659> a<00:02:43.959> Schrader<00:02:44.290> problem<00:02:46.319> now

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
right I've got a Schrader problem now

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.740 
right I've got a Schrader problem now
you<00:02:47.409> can<00:02:47.590> see<00:02:47.889> it's<00:02:48.849> leaking<00:02:49.180> like<00:02:49.329> a<00:02:49.389> sieve

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
you can see it's leaking like a sieve

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.289 
you can see it's leaking like a sieve
I've<00:02:50.650> tightened<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.219> down<00:02:51.250> doesn't<00:02:51.969> make<00:02:52.120> any

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
I've tightened it down doesn't make any

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.970 
I've tightened it down doesn't make any
difference<00:02:52.840> now<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.109> can<00:02:53.319> use<00:02:53.470> an<00:02:53.560> electronic

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
difference now you can use an electronic

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.339 
difference now you can use an electronic
for<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.340> too<00:02:54.579> but<00:02:54.879> I<00:02:55.120> use<00:02:55.659> soap<00:02:55.959> bubbles

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
for this too but I use soap bubbles

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.740 
for this too but I use soap bubbles
because<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.650> kind<00:02:56.829> of<00:02:56.889> shows<00:02:57.239> what's<00:02:58.239> going<00:02:58.569> on

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
because it kind of shows what's going on

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.440 
because it kind of shows what's going on
so<00:02:59.379> what<00:02:59.530> am<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.709> going<00:02:59.859> to<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.159> I'm<00:03:01.150> going<00:03:01.359> to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
so what am I going to do I'm going to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.440 
so what am I going to do I'm going to
demonstrate<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:03.340> Schrader<00:03:04.239> removal<00:03:04.780> tool<00:03:06.450> so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
demonstrate the Schrader removal tool so

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.349 
demonstrate the Schrader removal tool so
I'm<00:03:07.510> taking<00:03:07.719> the<00:03:07.959> cap<00:03:08.230> off<00:03:09.030> I've<00:03:10.030> come<00:03:10.329> down

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
I'm taking the cap off I've come down

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.190 
I'm taking the cap off I've come down
here<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:12.700> really<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:12.969> simple<00:03:13.209> tool<00:03:13.659> to<00:03:13.689> use

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
here it's really a simple tool to use

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.009 
here it's really a simple tool to use
once<00:03:14.680> you've<00:03:14.829> figured<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.250> out

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
once you've figured it out

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.839 
once you've figured it out
if<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.260> down<00:03:17.469> tight<00:03:18.569> now<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:21.340> open<00:03:21.519> this

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
if that down tight now I can open this

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.869 
if that down tight now I can open this
valve<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.739> that'll<00:03:23.739> allow<00:03:23.950> me<00:03:24.189> to<00:03:24.219> push<00:03:24.579> this

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
valve and that'll allow me to push this

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.610 
valve and that'll allow me to push this
in<00:03:25.239> now<00:03:26.229> getting<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:27.959> into<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.079> right<00:03:29.290> spot

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
in now getting this into the right spot

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.099 
in now getting this into the right spot
is<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.069> little<00:03:30.430> bit<00:03:30.579> hard<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.389> usually<00:03:31.750> clicks

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
is a little bit hard you usually clicks

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.349 
is a little bit hard you usually clicks
in<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:34.889> so<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:35.949> just<00:03:36.280> simply<00:03:36.729> unscrew<00:03:37.239> and

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
in and so you just simply unscrew and

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.699 
in and so you just simply unscrew and
you're<00:03:37.449> going<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.599> have<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.870> be<00:03:37.959> pressing<00:03:38.500> down

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
you're going to have to be pressing down

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.170 
you're going to have to be pressing down
on<00:03:38.739> like<00:03:39.189> I'm<00:03:39.370> doing<00:03:39.729> here

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
on like I'm doing here

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.729 
on like I'm doing here
because<00:03:40.780> otherwise<00:03:41.049> it's<00:03:41.349> just<00:03:41.470> going<00:03:41.680> to

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
because otherwise it's just going to

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:51.000 
because otherwise it's just going to
push<00:03:42.099> it<00:03:42.129> out

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.090 

now<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.070> can<00:03:52.310> hear<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.700> right<00:03:52.880> there<00:03:54.010> when<00:03:55.010> it

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
now you can hear it right there when it

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.190 
now you can hear it right there when it
clicks

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
clicks

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:07.450 
clicks
that<00:03:57.200> means<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:57.650> gun<00:03:58.690> so<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:06.770> it<00:04:07.040> should<00:04:07.310> be

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
that means it's gun so and it should be

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:17.899 
that means it's gun so and it should be
on<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.820> IMP

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.659 

okay<00:04:18.909> there<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.409> it's<00:04:20.409> pulled<00:04:20.739> out<00:04:20.979> now

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
okay there it is it's pulled out now

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.070 
okay there it is it's pulled out now
there's<00:04:21.909> no<00:04:22.030> shredder<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:22.599> this<00:04:22.720> thing<00:04:22.960> at

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
there's no shredder in this thing at

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.899 
there's no shredder in this thing at
this<00:04:23.259> time<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:23.860> I'm<00:04:23.949> going<00:04:24.129> to<00:04:24.189> take<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.370> new<00:04:24.639> one

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
this time so I'm going to take a new one

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:28.499 
this time so I'm going to take a new one
that<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.740> not<00:04:27.039> let<00:04:27.340> roll<00:04:27.669> around<00:04:27.909> on<00:04:28.330> the

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
that I have not let roll around on the

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.350 
that I have not let roll around on the
ground<00:04:28.990> or<00:04:29.349> anything<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:31.210> been

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
ground or anything like that it's been

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.450 
ground or anything like that it's been
pretty<00:04:31.629> well<00:04:31.719> protected<00:04:34.169> put<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.259> in<00:04:35.500> close

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
pretty well protected put it in close

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:45.899 
pretty well protected put it in close
this<00:04:41.789> open<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:42.909> valve<00:04:43.740> now<00:04:44.740> you're<00:04:45.699> going<00:04:45.849> to

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
this open the valve now you're going to

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.230 
this open the valve now you're going to
start<00:04:46.509> turning<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.729> you<00:04:48.789> should<00:04:49.090> be

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
start turning this so you should be

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.089 
start turning this so you should be
tightening<00:04:49.659> it<00:04:49.810> in<00:04:51.840> okay<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.050> can<00:04:53.530> feel<00:04:53.860> it's

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
tightening it in okay I can feel it's

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.680 
tightening it in okay I can feel it's
gotten<00:04:54.460> tight<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:57.240> should<00:04:58.240> have<00:04:58.479> my

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
gotten tight so I should have my

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.339 
gotten tight so I should have my
Schrader<00:04:59.050> in<00:04:59.669> then<00:05:00.669> this<00:05:01.389> pressure<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.199> going

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
Schrader in then this pressure is going

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:15.119 
Schrader in then this pressure is going
to<00:05:02.409> push<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.800> out<00:05:03.539> close<00:05:04.539> this<00:05:04.750> off<00:05:13.800> okay<00:05:14.800> the

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
to push this out close this off okay the

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.929 
to push this out close this off okay the
Schrader<00:05:15.460> is<00:05:15.610> not<00:05:15.789> there<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:18.520> has<00:05:18.699> to<00:05:18.879> be

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:18.939 
Schrader is not there so it has to be

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.499 
Schrader is not there so it has to be
inside<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.509> machine<00:05:19.840> I<00:05:20.969> start<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.090> take<00:05:22.270> this

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
inside the machine I start to take this

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:30.390 
inside the machine I start to take this
off<00:05:24.840> I'm<00:05:25.840> done<00:05:27.690> not<00:05:28.690> maybe<00:05:29.199> always<00:05:30.009> quite<00:05:30.370> that

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
off I'm done not maybe always quite that

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.450 
off I'm done not maybe always quite that
simple<00:05:31.379> sometimes<00:05:32.379> it<00:05:32.770> has<00:05:32.949> to<00:05:32.979> do<00:05:33.279> it<00:05:33.400> a

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
simple sometimes it has to do it a

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.600 
simple sometimes it has to do it a
couple<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.849> times<00:05:34.089> before<00:05:34.360> it<00:05:34.659> works<00:05:35.490> but<00:05:36.490> it's

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
couple of times before it works but it's

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.369 
couple of times before it works but it's
sure<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.759> heck<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.029> a<00:05:37.150> lot<00:05:37.300> better<00:05:37.599> than<00:05:40.379> dumping

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 
sure a heck of a lot better than dumping

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.649 
sure a heck of a lot better than dumping
the<00:05:41.500> charge<00:05:41.800> just<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.490> change<00:05:42.789> a<00:05:43.089> Schrader

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
the charge just to change a Schrader

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.040 
the charge just to change a Schrader
valve<00:05:44.069> okay<00:05:45.069> that's<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.819> on<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.599> shredder

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
valve okay that's it on the shredder

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.889 
valve okay that's it on the shredder
