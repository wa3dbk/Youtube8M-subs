you I had a professor once say that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.140 
you I had a professor once say that
powerful<00:02:15.950> statement<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.880> living

any<00:02:20.330> two-edged<00:02:20.870> sword<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.160> want<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.459> ask

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
any two-edged sword so we want to ask

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.710 
any two-edged sword so we want to ask
how<00:02:22.970> does<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.300> work

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
how does it work

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.110 
how does it work
so<00:02:24.170> for<00:02:24.410> instance<00:02:24.610> when<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.700> come<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
so for instance when you come to the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.390 
so for instance when you come to the
Bible<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.930> says<00:02:27.200> I've<00:02:27.470> hidden<00:02:28.069> your<00:02:28.370> word

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
Bible and it says I've hidden your word

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400 
Bible and it says I've hidden your word
in<00:02:28.700> my<00:02:28.850> heart<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> might<00:02:29.570> not<00:02:29.630> sin<00:02:30.050> against

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
in my heart that I might not sin against

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.920 
in my heart that I might not sin against
you<00:02:30.470> what<00:02:31.250> we<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.730> do<00:02:31.880> then<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.300> we<00:02:32.720> want

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
you what we want to do then is we want

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.230 
you what we want to do then is we want
to<00:02:33.020> ask<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.410> question<00:02:33.890> how<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.820> begin<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
to ask the question how can I begin to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.180 
to ask the question how can I begin to
memorize<00:02:35.630> scripture<00:02:36.140> he<00:02:36.680> memorized

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
memorize scripture he memorized

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.770 
memorize scripture he memorized
scripture<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.850> psalmist<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.690> he

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
scripture the psalmist so that he

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.960 
scripture the psalmist so that he
wouldn't<00:02:38.989> sin<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> application<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.820> if

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
wouldn't sin so the application is if

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.520 
wouldn't sin so the application is if
you<00:02:41.360> want<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.750> protect<00:02:42.140> yourself<00:02:42.500> from

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
you want to protect yourself from

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.860 
you want to protect yourself from
sinning<00:02:43.040> we<00:02:43.550> need<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.790> start<00:02:44.030> memorizing<00:02:44.510> some

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
sinning we need to start memorizing some

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.810 
sinning we need to start memorizing some
scripture<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.860> next<00:02:46.040> time<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.430> study<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
scripture so next time you study the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.380 
scripture so next time you study the
Bible<00:02:46.970> ask<00:02:47.720> how<00:02:48.680> does<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:49.130> work<00:02:49.670> after<00:02:50.300> you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
Bible ask how does it work after you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.780 
Bible ask how does it work after you
figured<00:02:50.720> out<00:02:50.870> what<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.560> means<00:02:51.739> based<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.580> some

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
figured out what it means based on some

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
figured out what it means based on some
observations<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.630> what<00:02:53.840> do<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.410> see

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470
