spongiosum<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:03.479> again<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> shed

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
spongiosum and again this is the shed

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.600 
spongiosum and again this is the shed
this<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> shaft<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.189> penis<00:02:05.280> right

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
this is in the shaft of the penis right

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.940 
this is in the shaft of the penis right
here<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.930> deeper<00:02:07.350> around<00:02:07.649> here

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
here and a little deeper around here

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.320 
here and a little deeper around here
again<00:02:08.099> oh<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.030> called<00:02:09.239> the

again oh that's going to be called the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.199 
again oh that's going to be called the
corpus<00:02:09.780> spongiosum<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.849> have<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
corpus spongiosum and then we have this

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.699 
corpus spongiosum and then we have this
darker<00:02:12.660> purple<00:02:13.200> or<00:02:13.410> blue

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
which is going to be the corpus

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.380 
which is going to be the corpus
cavernosum<00:02:16.489> then<00:02:17.489> we<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.939> region

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
cavernosum then we have this region

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.599 
cavernosum then we have this region
right<00:02:18.569> here<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:19.500> part<00:02:19.829> of<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.980> penis<00:02:20.340> is

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
right here this part of the penis is

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.800 
right here this part of the penis is
going<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.420> glans<00:02:21.719> penis<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.500> again

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
going to be the glans penis and again

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.080 
going to be the glans penis and again
proximal<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.079> going<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.859> be<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.310> shaft<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:27.060> the
