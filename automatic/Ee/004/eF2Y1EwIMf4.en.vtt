00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that was but less for example say we

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.610 
that was but less for example say we

were this same position as we are now I
would<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.500> worried<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.270> it's<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
would be worried I think it's because of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
think because Alex Neil is in charge and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
thought built this trust with him and I
feel<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> he<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.400> man<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:17.970> us<00:01:18.180> for

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
signings as well I think Watford it made

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.340 
signings as well I think Watford it made
something<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.030> seven<00:01:39.450> sightings<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.110> me

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
something like seven sightings with me

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.069 
something like seven sightings with me
to<00:01:40.970> one<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> them<00:01:42.240> were<00:01:42.360> already<00:01:42.659> pretty<00:01:42.869> much

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
to one of them were already pretty much

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.960 
to one of them were already pretty much
wrapped<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.530> pretty<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.310> sign<00:01:44.729> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
wrapped up so pretty much one sign in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.899 
wrapped up so pretty much one sign in
now<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.990> think<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.500> need<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.979> four<00:01:47.640> more

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
now I think we need about four more

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.520 
now I think we need about four more
players<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.079> centre<00:01:49.500> back

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
players I think we need a centre back

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.950 
players I think we need a centre back
that's<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> definite<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.840> need

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that's a definite I think we need

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.749 
that's a definite I think we need
another<00:01:51.990> striker<00:01:52.590> who<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.399> been<00:01:53.549> linked

maybe<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.450> who<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> play<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:01.320> back<00:02:01.590> and

alonso<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.380> i<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.710> he'd<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> good<00:02:05.189> job<00:02:05.540> and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
alonso go i think he'd do a good job and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.749 
alonso go i think he'd do a good job and
i<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.990> need<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> left<00:02:07.439> midfielder<00:02:08.099> who

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
i think we need a left midfielder who

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.240 
i think we need a left midfielder who
you<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.780> who<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.470> Robbie<00:02:10.920> Brady

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250

you all know who that is Robbie Brady
we've<00:02:11.520> been<00:02:11.640> linked

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
we've been linked

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.660 
we've been linked
them<00:02:12.110> for<00:02:12.260> about<00:02:12.350> fifty<00:02:12.830> two<00:02:12.980> years<00:02:13.280> i<00:02:13.370> think

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
them for about fifty two years i think

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.700 
them for about fifty two years i think
but<00:02:14.270> i<00:02:14.330> think<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:14.930> get<00:02:15.170> four<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.590> them

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
but i think if we get four of them

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.470 
but i think if we get four of them
players<00:02:16.010> maybe<00:02:16.340> not<00:02:16.610> them<00:02:16.760> for<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:17.270> i<00:02:17.300> think

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
players maybe not them for but i think

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.770 
players maybe not them for but i think
if<00:02:17.570> we<00:02:17.600> get<00:02:17.780> them<00:02:17.960> for<00:02:18.200> players<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:19.070> saw<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.780> do

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
if we get them for players we saw it do

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.840 
if we get them for players we saw it do
I<00:02:20.840> think<00:02:21.140> we'll<00:02:21.260> get<00:02:21.500> for<00:02:21.890> players<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.460> course

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
I think we'll get for players of course

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.900 
I think we'll get for players of course
we<00:02:23.030> will<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:23.630> we<00:02:24.500> saw<00:02:24.740> in<00:02:24.920> Alex<00:02:25.310> Neal's<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
we will I think we saw in Alex Neal's is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.960 
we will I think we saw in Alex Neal's is

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.860 
said that he has been out there looking
for<00:02:30.860> players<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.340> he's<00:02:31.670> frustrated<00:02:32.540> with<00:02:32.570> the

for players and he's frustrated with the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
lack of signs he's made he's made it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.820 
lack of signs he's made he's made it
clear<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.450> we've<00:02:35.750> got<00:02:35.990> out<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.500> we've<00:02:36.650> tried

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
to purchase place it's not like we're

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
these players admittedly we have we've

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.630 
these players admittedly we have we've
handled<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.410> Robbie<00:02:48.590> Brady<00:02:48.920> deal<00:02:49.220> pretty

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
handled the Robbie Brady deal pretty

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.210 
handled the Robbie Brady deal pretty
badly<00:02:49.850> but<00:02:50.720> as<00:02:50.870> Alex<00:02:51.140> Neil<00:02:51.440> said<00:02:51.710> we've<00:02:52.010> done

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
badly but as Alex Neil said we've done

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.130 
badly but as Alex Neil said we've done
all<00:02:52.340> we<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.670> we're<00:02:53.180> waiting<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.600> other<00:02:53.780> clubs

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
all we can we're waiting on other clubs

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.920 
all we can we're waiting on other clubs
if<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.800> was<00:02:54.920> our<00:02:55.070> sort<00:02:55.520> of<00:02:55.610> problems<00:02:56.600> that<00:02:56.810> were

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
if it was our sort of problems that were

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.570 
if it was our sort of problems that were
that<00:02:57.230> were<00:02:57.290> creating<00:02:57.800> this<00:02:57.920> sort<00:02:58.550> of

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
that were creating this sort of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.270 
that were creating this sort of
longevity<00:02:58.820> of<00:02:59.450> having<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.290> wait<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.920> these

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
longevity of having to wait for these

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.890 
longevity of having to wait for these
players<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:01.880> would<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.270> slightly<00:03:02.540> worried

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
players that I would be slightly worried

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.990 
players that I would be slightly worried
but<00:03:02.990> I'm<00:03:03.080> genuinely<00:03:03.370> not<00:03:04.370> worried<00:03:04.700> i<00:03:04.790> think

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
but I'm genuinely not worried i think

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.220 
but I'm genuinely not worried i think
we'll<00:03:05.120> make<00:03:05.240> signs<00:03:05.600> i<00:03:05.810> think<00:03:05.990> they'll<00:03:06.080> be<00:03:06.200> good

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
we'll make signs i think they'll be good

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.260 
we'll make signs i think they'll be good
signings<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:07.010> think<00:03:07.520> they'll<00:03:07.640> each<00:03:07.760> sign<00:03:07.970> that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
signings I think they'll each sign that

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.760 
signings I think they'll each sign that
I've<00:03:08.360> got<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.570> take<00:03:08.750> us<00:03:08.960> forward<00:03:09.200> next<00:03:09.470> season

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
I've got to take us forward next season

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.160 
I've got to take us forward next season
Alex<00:03:10.100> Neil<00:03:10.310> knows<00:03:11.000> what<00:03:11.480> he's<00:03:11.690> doing<00:03:12.080> and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
Alex Neil knows what he's doing and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.200 
Alex Neil knows what he's doing and
that's<00:03:12.350> cut<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.800> thing<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:13.670> making<00:03:14.180> me

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
that's cut the thing this making me

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.630 
that's cut the thing this making me
fairly<00:03:14.510> calm<00:03:14.870> about<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.800> whole<00:03:15.830> ordeal<00:03:16.430> that

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
fairly calm about the whole ordeal that

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.780 
fairly calm about the whole ordeal that
it<00:03:16.910> seems<00:03:17.120> plays<00:03:17.390> family<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.500> way<00:03:18.770> too<00:03:18.830> wound

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
it seems plays family and way too wound

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.750 
it seems plays family and way too wound
up<00:03:20.090> about<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.990> lack<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.200> signings<00:03:21.800> yes<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.430> know

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
up about the lack of signings yes I know

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.490 
up about the lack of signings yes I know
it<00:03:23.060> would<00:03:23.330> have<00:03:23.420> been<00:03:23.510> perfect<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:24.170> have<00:03:24.230> these

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
it would have been perfect to have these

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.830 
it would have been perfect to have these
players<00:03:24.770> in<00:03:24.920> preseason<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.360> be<00:03:26.480> honest<00:03:26.750> I

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
players in preseason but to be honest I

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.120 
players in preseason but to be honest I
think<00:03:27.020> Alex<00:03:27.140> Neil<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.500> throw<00:03:27.710> them<00:03:27.740> straight

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
think Alex Neil or throw them straight

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.500 
think Alex Neil or throw them straight
in<00:03:28.250> there<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.550> they'll<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.790> fine<00:03:29.000> we've<00:03:29.180> got

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
in there and they'll be fine we've got

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.560 
in there and they'll be fine we've got
was<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.260> three<00:03:30.560> more<00:03:30.740> games<00:03:31.430> left<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:32.150> think<00:03:32.420> we

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
was it three more games left I think we

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.020 
was it three more games left I think we
need<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.990> make<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.440> few<00:03:34.190> sizes<00:03:34.430> before<00:03:34.730> our

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
need to make a few sizes before our

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.120 
need to make a few sizes before our
first<00:03:35.210> home<00:03:35.480> preseason<00:03:35.750> game<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.890> think

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
first home preseason game and I think

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.000 
first home preseason game and I think
that<00:03:37.280> will<00:03:37.400> happen<00:03:37.550> i<00:03:38.050> promise<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.530> guys<00:03:39.710> will

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
that will happen i promise you guys will

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.580

make<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.190> sign<00:03:40.490> in<00:03:40.640> before<00:03:40.730> our<00:03:40.970> first<00:03:41.590> home

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
make a sign in before our first home

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.710 
make a sign in before our first home
preseason<00:03:42.920> that's<00:03:43.730> risky<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.420> think<00:03:44.450> it's

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
preseason that's risky I think it's

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.390 
preseason that's risky I think it's
going<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:44.930> happen<00:03:45.050> what<00:03:45.980> do<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.160> guys<00:03:46.340> think
