right<00:02:40.370> here<00:02:40.520> she's<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.240> tall<00:02:41.570> she<00:02:41.720> has<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.990> lean

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
right here she's so tall she has to lean

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.540 
right here she's so tall she has to lean
down<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:42.770> bit<00:02:42.920> on<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.130> hurdles<00:02:43.400> and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
down a little bit on the hurdles and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.460 
down a little bit on the hurdles and
Priscilla<00:02:44.090> looks<00:02:44.300> at<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:44.870> point<00:02:45.140> says<00:02:45.320> you

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
Priscilla looks at this point says you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.920 
Priscilla looks at this point says you
know<00:02:45.590> what<00:02:45.800> here<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.670> come<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.300> she<00:02:47.690> comes

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
know what here I come and she comes

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.540 
know what here I come and she comes
right<00:02:48.200> back<00:02:48.470> at<00:02:48.710> her<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.190> think<00:02:49.250> at<00:02:49.430> this

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
right back at her and I think at this

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.160 
right back at her and I think at this
point<00:02:49.880> Virginia<00:02:50.270> Paola<00:02:50.480> starts<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.810> feel<00:02:51.020> her

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
point Virginia Paola starts to feel her

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.380 
point Virginia Paola starts to feel her
and<00:02:51.530> she<00:02:52.190> did<00:02:52.340> well<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.790> hang<00:02:52.970> on<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.330> win

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
and she did well to hang on for the win

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.490 
and she did well to hang on for the win
I<00:02:55.510> think<00:02:56.510> Virginia<00:02:56.630> Powell<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.230> actually

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
I think Virginia Powell is actually

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.720 
I think Virginia Powell is actually
running<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:57.920> fast<00:02:58.100> right<00:02:58.340> now<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.610> she's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
running so fast right now that she's

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.040 
running so fast right now that she's
running<00:02:59.030> up<00:02:59.090> on<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.360> hurdles<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.720> we<00:02:59.780> saw

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
running up on the hurdles and we saw

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.810 
running up on the hurdles and we saw
this<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.500> back<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.250> then<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.640> past

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
this in the back and then in the past

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.680 
this in the back and then in the past
with<00:03:02.120> Gail<00:03:02.300> Devers<00:03:02.540> pals<00:03:03.410> head<00:03:04.480> seemed<00:03:05.480> to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
with Gail Devers pals head seemed to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.130 
with Gail Devers pals head seemed to
lunge<00:03:06.080> forward<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:08.060> up<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.450> finish<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
lunge forward just up to finish the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.790 
lunge forward just up to finish the
torso<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.989> difference<00:03:12.350> here<00:03:12.590> I

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
torso and that is the difference here I

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.830 
torso and that is the difference here I
think<00:03:13.370> Virginia<00:03:13.489> follows<00:03:14.030> very<00:03:14.330> easily<00:03:14.600> she

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
think Virginia follows very easily she

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.180 
think Virginia follows very easily she
was<00:03:14.959> running<00:03:15.200> up<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:15.380> these<00:03:15.530> hurdles<00:03:15.770> alive

and when Priscilla Lopes came up on her

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.410 
and when Priscilla Lopes came up on her
left<00:03:18.620> on<00:03:19.160> her<00:03:19.280> right<00:03:19.489> she<00:03:19.940> really<00:03:20.270> had<00:03:20.360> a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420
