00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.810
 moin and welcome to one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.430
 new intro video of me I do not know 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.529
 How are you? I'm pretty good 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.449
 this is partly because of that 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.529
 The august is coming to an end 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.529
 tends and that leads to that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.239
 an appointment actually every gamer in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.520
 Germany should have on the screen 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.530
 getting closer you know already 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.930
 each of which is about gamescom 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.360
 and of course I will be on the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.690
 be gamescom and all four 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.360
 public days and I would like me 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.039
 really crazy if you look 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.329
 So talk to a few of you 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 could come 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.230
 so that I just notice who 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.680
 actually subscribe to me because that is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.660
 although now 4300 people but me 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.559
 I must honestly say for myself 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.690
 I still do not have that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 Realized how much that is 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.369
 and that 's all really people 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 Lower valley behind screen 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.600
 that means i really would 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 I am so happy I do not know how you are 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.140
 look but you know how I look 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.400
 if you see me at gamescom 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.110
 would talk and how he recognizes 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.799
 Just tell me once you know like me 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.600
 look 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.960
 on the other hand I will be a whole 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 wearing a particular t-shirt or polo shirt 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.740
 namely this one and that is from 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.090
 front now relatively unspectacular 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 important is what's on the back 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.049
 in the end , that's the way it is now 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.970
 unfortunately not if theirs can see that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.950
 I will become this Christian symbol, too 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630
 same again one'm in Show 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.479
 Video 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.369
 this is blue gaming de the platform of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.219
 gamern for gamer where i also a part 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.070
 I 'm still going to be one of those 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.380
 link down in the infobox blue 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.659
 gaming is a pretty good website 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.030
 and we are there as a big group around 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.350
 that means you do not just become 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.610
 but see me with this shirt 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.320
 probably a few other 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.670
 no matter you like the others too 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.520
 But I will talk to people 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.320
 probably look questioningly gossip 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.480
 I would really love myself 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.650
 looking forward 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.990
 and there's a little one around you now 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.300
 why he should do that 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.040
 quite simply I will be a little 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.070
 action on the gamescom run 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.400
 and I will take a pencil with me 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.770
 inevitably carry around and I will 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.050
 small maps have it 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.730
 whole has the meaning if you look at me 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.300
 chats should be a guide wish 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.040
 express 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.880
 that means you write me on this 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.380
 card your nickname and your courage 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 champion and then I will finish at the end 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.090
 the gamescom the whole in a big one 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.959
 Lost drums are nice to mix 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.940
 and then pull out a skid of 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.010
 to give him his time, as it were 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.600
 The whole only if you can me 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.130
 live personally at gamescom 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.840
 what you can do is fill it up 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.390
 like to prepare yourself will be the hand 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.709
 I do not care about pushing 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.870
 and in addition to this big one 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.290
 I thought about the raffle 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.730
 I also still each on the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.989
 first person taking me every day 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.549
 has come again in the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.670
 special drum is called in total 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.910
 up to four candidates Thursday 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.950
 friday saturday sunday and these out 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:38.160
 These four cards, so to speak, I prefer too 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.480
 again in which I make especially of 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.920
 the other that is if you to this 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.680
 Much of me is the first 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.360
 talk then you have a substantial 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.100
 Higher chance that your money comes 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.690
 Of course, it can also be good that mg pro 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.600
 one more person a day then waits 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.760
 the whole thing is a bit obsolete 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.810
 but I do not hope so I would 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.640
 I am still happy to write in the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.370
 comments if you come to the gamescom 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.100
 or not and when you come some 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.540
 Days would interest me 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.709
 and of course the whole I will too 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.170
 always on facebook or twitter 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.690
 post where I am right now so did 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.209
 We definitely useful to follow me 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.710
 with smartphone, of course, otherwise he gets 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.930
 the whole 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.540
 but that's as good as today 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.330
 everyone and facebook and later too 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.560
 again below in the description and 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.850
 now the last point 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.330
 Of course I have it in the 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.460

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.500
 you see me if you do not 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.150
 The reality is overly often 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.740
 have to play uno with me underneath 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.990
 at the gamescom simply because it's funny 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.610
 is and animal fun that makes 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.620
 means I have the gamescom on me 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.180
