00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
not replaced blades yet on this because

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.310 
not replaced blades yet on this because
we<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.240> worn<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:39.479> yet<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.020> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
we just have not worn them out yet but I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.069 
we just have not worn them out yet but I
know<00:01:40.409> there's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.799> day<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.630> inside<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.840> your

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
know there's a day and inside are your

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
know there's a day and inside are your
replacement<00:01:43.590> blades<00:01:43.770> put<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.340> together

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
replacement blades put it back together

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
replacement blades put it back together
in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> hole<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.259> silver<00:01:46.619> well

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
in the hole here you see silver well

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.350 
in the hole here you see silver well
that<00:01:46.950> means<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.369> blades<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:48.299> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that means you have blades when you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.149 
that means you have blades when you
don't<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.689> silver<00:01:49.020> anymore<00:01:49.259> your<00:01:49.770> blades<00:01:50.009> are

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
don't see silver anymore your blades are

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
don't see silver anymore your blades are
gone<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.810> would<00:01:54.930> our

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
gone so it kind of is is it we would our

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.840 
gone so it kind of is is it we would our
goal<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.829> simple<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.219> product<00:01:56.729> in

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
goal is it's a simple little product in

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550 
goal is it's a simple little product in
fact<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.270> simple<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.750> thought<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.350> had<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
fact it's so simple we thought we had to
