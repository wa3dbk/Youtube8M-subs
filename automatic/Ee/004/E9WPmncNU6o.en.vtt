 federica de bortoli 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.080
 sernagiotto beatrice callegari marika 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.440
 toned jenny d'alessandro enrica 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.630
 small and now minus 2 because they are missing 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 only two formations for then 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.440
 decide the medals praised 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.930
 the amateur association also 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.350
 this one of Rome overhangs the music and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.640
 choreography by the choreographer chris lee su 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.030
 this music in the water and there is precisely has 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.980
 spoken by Giorgio Minisini and the items a 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.559
 knock this interpretation 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.269
 nice the jump is the ferrera air that makes 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.269
 the tense mortal leap as foster care 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.739
 obviously the emanuele marini support 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.739
 that the echo arrives in the acrobatic part 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.060
 sequence for their training changes 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.060
 as we have said before 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.950
 a new routine presented for these 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.350
 Italian championships for rent in gray 2015 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.970
 but it is a team that more or less at one 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.490
 core working together for four 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.509
 years so you already know a group 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.770
 consolidated 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.770
 despite two new entries 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.940
 obviously the presence of Giorgio 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.750
 certain enrich you is indeed we work 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.490
 very with 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.160
 the inclusion of men the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.610
 synchronized for us is absolutely 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.360
 an enriching moment of power 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.850
 of very beautiful launch of the maneuver 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.260
 vertical arrival phase of the di 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.009
 sincere leg and fades can not 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.009
 instead of screwing 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.970
 reinterpretation of michael jackson 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.010
 for this final exercise and the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.750
 penultimate team tries to play one 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.280
 medal was staying 10 but last year 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.500
 to 2014 with giorgio minisini inside 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.460
 however participate for us in the world championship 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.460
 the absolute first 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.320
 third element beautiful control a lot 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.180
 stable very well emphasized also in the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.450
 chosen times do not think well 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.450
 without 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.180
 split barracuda raised you are you 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.520
 given a certain nuance in the le 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.050
 openings recovering a bit of novello 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.030
 instead regarding the minds that 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.180
 which we have anticipated many times 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.080
 it is one of the most truly elements 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.200
 risky and do even a little balance 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.180
 2.5 difficulty so definitely the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.860
 second in order of their importance 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.370
 due to cusco risk and relationships 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:23.140
 which is expressed and then talking to one 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.920
 part of calls also for them talking 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.870
 with the coach what point is 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.459
 because the story that if fought there 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.530
 they also explained the difficulty of 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.580
 always have the girls together that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.870
 will 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.180
 everyone is part of a group of 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.739
 different national junior giorgio that yes 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.690
 train as we have played before 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.920
 for the home duo and therefore have 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.989
 difficulty in having the whole group 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.340
 together like and therefore also have no 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.500
 put the choreography by 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.380
 synchrony becomes a little more 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.870
 difficult going back to the success proposes 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.830
 thanks also to the help of IT of 98 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.600
 turin 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.880
 these important moments of this 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.269
 penultimate the last team housed 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:08.049
 fell into the water in search of a medal 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:09.920
 now we will see what will happen on 78 224 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.790
 this should be the result 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.030
 we await only the confirmation of the door to 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.579
 sixth place is still a result 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.160
 compared to the whole tenth that passed 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.790
 fit with all the changes with 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.710
 in short, the insertion of a new one 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.750
 absolutely no loan is a pass 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.880
 however in front of the all around that 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.169
 instead a team that we already have 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.850
 anticipated he had this problem 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.470
 on the penalty and therefore had a 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.710
 entry to the final 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.800
 we don't say of 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.570
 it is clear that they now have this in mind 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.890
 taken advantage of this difference of 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.400
 to look at the merit group doing 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.320
 a climb over the significant estimate 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.740
 so for them I believe they are 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.750
 happy with the result obtained ie 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.820
 they could expect better than it is 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.620
 instead the surprise so much to me I die a 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.620
 play the gold medal
