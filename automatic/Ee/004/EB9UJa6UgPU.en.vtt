00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.040
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.769
 of good teacher remember our 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.840
 page we have thousands of exercises for 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.000
 schedule and get very good grades in 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.260
 physics and chemistry mathematics there you have 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.089
 the like button cf so is that for 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.740
 open up your great support well let's do 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.199
 this exercise that has sent me a 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.329
 examination follower will see how 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.890
 it will be complicated it feels of all we are 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.320
 able to do so so helping 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.530
 come sulfuric acid is reacted 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.079
 h264 with sodium hydroxide 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.629
 nh to obtain sodium sulfate n 2 of 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.000
 that 4 and water calculate the sulfate mass 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.570
 of sodium that we will obtain from 35 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.219
 milliliters of a solution of nheo h 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.840
 1.5 or which then what 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.730
 we have to do so we have to do 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.769
 the reaction and adjust the good if they are 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.230
 the data and come then go doing 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.210
 the house is worth so you practice and then 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.200
 bought you go see if it's okay come 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.879
 then sulfuric acid h2so4 more 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:08.870
 well and you get sodium sulfate in 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.510
 age so 4 more loves well and now we have 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.090
 that adjust the truth and that you do not forget 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.370
 adjust a reaction 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.390
 you can never forget to adjust a 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.090
 eye reaction is worth 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.270
 we have two hydrogens and 13 there are already two 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.910
 just to put a 2 here together here 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.979
 ok then I already have is good is 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.500
 tight ok I will not fight with 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.090
 you come then we have the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 problem that they give us tell us that 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.520
 we have 35 milliliters of a solution 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.530
 1,5 molar again because we have 35 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.800
 milliliters me instead of putting 35 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.560
 milliliters I'm going to pass it to liters 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.310
 it's worth to new again how to melt 35 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.020
 milliliters we know that one thousand milliliters 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.610
 it's a link of humidity 0035 links and already what 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:05.860
 put 00 35 liters of a solution of 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.349
 mode 1.5 default is worth it and they ask me 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 who ask us to calculate the mass of 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:15.780
 sodium sulfate 2 grams 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.430
 to have two three or four good for 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.830
 put the most criticized out there 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.930
 we achieve why you are not right 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.270
 the mares I have is a bit old 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.270
 cantankerous to walk away but 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.220
 I feel that grams or should I put g 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.440
 well then for what steps do we have to 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.590
 do come very well at home first 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.340
 model that they give me that they are nh second 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.720
 k model you ask na 2s 4 and is the only 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.360
 step that we used the coefficient 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.130
 this assignment is worth and third and this 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.960
 When I say it, I think that at home 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.950
 repeat with me come all together 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.930
 third last step then we go to 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.030
 it first flight that they give me as they give 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.030
 the modality I go to the formula are 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.790
 moll is absolute 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.790
 party liters of dissolution 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.350
 I know I know the modality and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.480
 I know the solution data then they go 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.810
 to calculate the moles of absolute by the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.820
 absolute is worth the liters of instruction 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.710
 they are dividing what I want 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.410
 calculate then they will pass for the other side 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.150
 multiplying the modality by liters 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.239
 of dissolution 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.810
 then we have polarity 15 for 0 0 35 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.870
 15 for 0 035 if I have not been cheated 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.519
 calculator since you go behind to see if I 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.750
 wrong is blamed calculated at 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:48.410
 letters 1000 525 moles 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.880
 dna oh I already have the moles of what I 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.490
 take the first step now let's 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.140
 calculate the second step that are moll is 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.760
 what they ask of me and it is the only step that 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.270
 we use the coefficient be here 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.610
 doctor 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:04.130
 0 0 525 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.190
 moles of nh 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.260
 for we know that two moles very 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.390
 important of 22 moles 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.370
 again what are they 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.560
 reacts or you get a mol 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.030
 dna 2 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.800
 of that 4 and we already get the moles of n2s 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.800
 4 with the middle 0026 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.840
 moles 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.000
 dna 2 of the software was the last step 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.789
 we have to move from moles and when 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.900
 they ask for grams to grams as we went through 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.490
 the molecular mass that I was not 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.509
 calculated will be regulated here below the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:48.669
 Molecular mass of line 2 s or 4 is equal 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:52.300
 to 2 for 23 plus sulfur x 32 plus 4 for 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.680
 16 we already take the calculator and me 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.680
 gave 142 grams 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.470
 bad match are worth 142 grams of enea two 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.870
 those four we have a mold na 2s 4 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.180
 vega then this would be the second step 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.460
 to mark them 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.889
 with what you see clearly and now the third 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.380
 step would be 0026 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.550
 moles of enea 2 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.720
 3 or 4 for 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.640
 one mole 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.930
 dna two three or four that are are 142 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.289
 grams of enea 204 even a little 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.240
 roll drag tabs 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.639
 now it will always be to avoid mistakes 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.749
 also check the diagonals that 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.689
 this day one night I have to go with 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:44.629
 this and this one with this I already have grams of 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:47.559
 n2s or four and to me that gave me three 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.559
 points 73 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.500
 grams of line 2 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.900
 I wish 4 underline let's put a good 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.630
 well big very well today I'm what 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.390
 threw everything 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.760
 come and I want your comments on 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.590
 I have done it this I do it 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.140
 I am a machine with the help of sergio 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.920
 I did it before crisis this and it came out 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.450
 that I am a machine worth or the one that 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.830
 I've done it before, it's wrong that I 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.750
 explain where you have been wrong to see 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.160
 what things do we have to work on 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.440
 come on let's continue doing some 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.830
 exercise more examination come see you 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.830
 in the next
