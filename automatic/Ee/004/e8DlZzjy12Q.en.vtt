00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190

what my viruses viruses might be good

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.790 
what my viruses viruses might be good
they<00:06:11.289> seem<00:06:11.590> vulnerable<00:06:11.919> to<00:06:12.550> viruses<00:06:12.759> and

they seem vulnerable to viruses and

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.350 
they seem vulnerable to viruses and
viruses<00:06:14.800> are<00:06:14.919> tricky<00:06:15.190> always<00:06:15.669> mutating<00:06:16.240> and

viruses are tricky always mutating and

you<00:06:53.050> want<00:06:53.260> no<00:06:53.919> what<00:06:54.039> I<00:06:54.099> call<00:06:54.370> it<00:06:54.520> the<00:06:54.729> big

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.380 

it<00:07:04.780> doesn't<00:07:05.110> punish<00:07:05.320> it<00:07:06.010> doesn't<00:07:06.370> reward<00:07:06.490> it

it doesn't punish it doesn't reward it

it doesn't punish it doesn't reward it
doesn't<00:07:07.870> even<00:07:07.930> judge<00:07:08.350> it<00:07:09.130> just<00:07:09.400> is<00:07:09.670> and<00:07:10.000> so<00:07:10.870> are
