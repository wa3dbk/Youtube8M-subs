hi<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.480> Jim<00:00:00.810> and<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.439> do<00:00:02.280> a

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hi this is Jim and we're going to do a

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.860 
hi this is Jim and we're going to do a
number<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.850> videos<00:00:03.270> on<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:04.200> science<00:00:04.740> behind

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
number of videos on the science behind

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.129 
number of videos on the science behind
scale<00:00:06.870> construction<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:08.330> also<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.630> science

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
scale construction and also the science

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.200 
scale construction and also the science
behind<00:00:10.910> how<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.969> play<00:00:12.330> any<00:00:13.230> chord<00:00:14.210> really

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
behind how to play any chord really

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.460 
behind how to play any chord really
really<00:00:15.480> fast<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.990> I'm<00:00:16.080> talking<00:00:16.440> about

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
really fast and I'm talking about

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.840 
really fast and I'm talking about
extensions<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:19.189> changes<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.609> you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
extensions and and changes that we you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.640 
extensions and and changes that we you
would<00:00:21.029> probably<00:00:21.600> cause<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.199> start

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
would probably cause you to start

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730 
would probably cause you to start
drooling<00:00:23.039> if<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.970> had<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.720> them<00:00:24.900> so

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
drooling if you had to think of them so

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.050 
drooling if you had to think of them so
what<00:00:25.890> we're<00:00:26.010> gonna<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:26.609> gonna<00:00:26.670> start

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna start

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna start
right<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> first<00:00:28.740> lesson<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
right now with the first lesson and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130 
right now with the first lesson and
that's<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> discussion<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that's going to be a discussion on the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.889 
that's going to be a discussion on the
construction<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> keyboard<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
construction of the keyboard have you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
construction of the keyboard have you
ever<00:00:34.110> wondered<00:00:34.559> why<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.550> missing

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
ever wondered why there is a missing

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.670 
ever wondered why there is a missing
black<00:00:36.750> note<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.620> ever

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
black note in here have you ever

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.979 
black note in here have you ever
wondered<00:00:38.430> why<00:00:38.640> there<00:00:38.910> aren't<00:00:39.120> black<00:00:39.450> notes<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
wondered why there aren't black notes in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.580 
wondered why there aren't black notes in
here<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.000> major<00:00:42.480> scale<00:00:43.879> has<00:00:44.879> a

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
here that's because a major scale has a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.180 
here that's because a major scale has a
half-step<00:00:46.590> interval<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:49.010> intervals<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
half-step interval on the intervals of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
half-step interval on the intervals of
three<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> four<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> seven<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.170> eight

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
three and four and seven and eight

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
three and four and seven and eight
now<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> major<00:00:53.910> scale<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.629> let's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
now this is for a major scale so let's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.799 
now this is for a major scale so let's
play<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> C<00:00:55.770> major<00:00:56.190> scale<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> C<00:00:57.390> scale

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
play a C major scale because the C scale

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.080 
play a C major scale because the C scale
is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> always<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> return<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is the one you always want to return to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.420 
is the one you always want to return to
if<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> forget<00:01:00.840> where<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> intervals<00:01:02.190> are

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
if you forget where the intervals are

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.690 
if you forget where the intervals are
take<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> look<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> C<00:01:03.690> scale<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.229> C<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.530> C<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
take a look at a C scale from C to C the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.270 
take a look at a C scale from C to C the
keyboard<00:01:06.270> will<00:01:06.510> tell<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.080> where<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.890> half

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
keyboard will tell you where the half

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.780 
keyboard will tell you where the half
steps<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.299> let's<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:10.020> two<00:01:10.530> three<00:01:11.189> four

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
steps are so let's do one two three four

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.310 
steps are so let's do one two three four
five<00:01:12.390> six<00:01:13.020> seven<00:01:13.860> eight<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> let's<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
five six seven eight so let's do that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.700 
five six seven eight so let's do that
again<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:16.979> three<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> four<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.710> seven

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
again one two three and four and seven

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
again one two three and four and seven
and<00:01:19.920> eight<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> half-step<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and eight now what is a half-step a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.950 
and eight now what is a half-step a
half-step<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.340> distance<00:01:23.759> from<00:01:24.000> any<00:01:24.390> note

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
half-step is the distance from any note

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.969 
half-step is the distance from any note
to<00:01:25.619> its<00:01:25.920> next<00:01:26.700> adjacent<00:01:26.850> note<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.049> its<00:01:28.470> next

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
to its next adjacent note up or its next

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.770 
to its next adjacent note up or its next
note<00:01:29.490> down<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.079> go<00:01:31.259> from<00:01:31.439> C<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.159> D<00:01:32.780> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
note down so if we go from C to D it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
note down so if we go from C to D it's
one<00:01:34.110> half<00:01:34.380> plus<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.950> half<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.790> be

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
one half plus one half so this would be

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.510 
one half plus one half so this would be
a<00:01:35.909> whole<00:01:36.119> step<00:01:36.420> half<00:01:37.290> plus<00:01:37.650> half<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
a whole step half plus half this is a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.929 
a whole step half plus half this is a
whole<00:01:38.759> step<00:01:39.030> notice<00:01:39.840> no<00:01:40.500> black<00:01:40.979> note<00:01:41.280> so

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
whole step notice no black note so

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
whole step notice no black note so
here's<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:43.079> rule<00:01:43.259> whole<00:01:43.680> steps<00:01:43.979> all

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
here's your little rule whole steps all

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.300 
here's your little rule whole steps all
the<00:01:44.340> way<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.759> until<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.180> hit<00:01:45.299> three<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.689> four

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
the way up until we hit three and four

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.819 
the way up until we hit three and four
whole<00:01:47.310> steps<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.790> way<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.030> until<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.390> hit

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
whole steps all the way up until we hit

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.950 
whole steps all the way up until we hit
seven<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.950> eight<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.659> remember

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
seven and eight so if you can remember

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.889 
seven and eight so if you can remember
this<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:53.280> whole<00:01:53.579> steps<00:01:53.759> except<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.659> three

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this all whole steps except for three

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
this all whole steps except for three
and<00:01:54.990> four<00:01:55.340> seven<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.460> eight<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> apply

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and four seven and eight you can apply

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.069 
and four seven and eight you can apply
that<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.630> any<00:01:58.070> scale<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.299> keyboard<00:02:00.750> start

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that to any scale on the keyboard start

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
that to any scale on the keyboard start
anywhere<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.950> let's<00:02:02.219> follow<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.729> rules

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
anywhere you want let's follow the rules

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.020 
anywhere you want let's follow the rules
so<00:02:03.780> let's<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.170> let's<00:02:04.549> let's<00:02:05.549> start<00:02:05.640> with

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so let's do that let's let's start with

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.339 
so let's do that let's let's start with
a<00:02:06.860> D<00:02:07.860> flat<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> C<00:02:08.849> sharp<00:02:08.879> major<00:02:09.720> scale<00:02:10.080> now

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
a D flat or a C sharp major scale now

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.589 
a D flat or a C sharp major scale now
remember<00:02:10.739> we're<00:02:10.890> talking<00:02:11.069> about<00:02:11.599> major

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
remember we're talking about major

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.890 
remember we're talking about major
scales<00:02:13.110> only<00:02:13.410> right<00:02:13.709> now

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
scales only right now

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.750 
scales only right now
we'll<00:02:14.019> cover<00:02:14.230> miners<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.010> melodic<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.610> all

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
we'll cover miners and melodic and all

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.520 
we'll cover miners and melodic and all
of<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.000> other<00:02:16.150> forums<00:02:16.629> but<00:02:16.780> let's<00:02:16.989> talk<00:02:17.170> about

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
of the other forums but let's talk about

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.280 
of the other forums but let's talk about
major<00:02:18.310> scales<00:02:18.790> right<00:02:19.120> now<00:02:19.269> we're<00:02:19.870> gonna<00:02:19.959> start

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
major scales right now we're gonna start

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.250 
major scales right now we're gonna start
on<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.860> C<00:02:21.310> sharp<00:02:21.340> or<00:02:21.790> D<00:02:21.849> flat<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.420> let's<00:02:22.599> play

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
on a C sharp or D flat and let's play

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.670 
on a C sharp or D flat and let's play
the<00:02:23.290> little<00:02:23.530> formula<00:02:24.040> out<00:02:24.280> one<00:02:24.909> two<00:02:25.599> three<00:02:26.500> now

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the little formula out one two three now

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.289 
the little formula out one two three now
those<00:02:26.829> were<00:02:26.980> all<00:02:27.129> halves<00:02:27.430> or<00:02:27.760> whole<00:02:28.030> steps

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
those were all halves or whole steps

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.920 
those were all halves or whole steps
three<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.409> four<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.579> a<00:02:30.700> half<00:02:30.849> step<00:02:30.879> one<00:02:31.629> two

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
three and four it's a half step one two

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.819 
three and four it's a half step one two
three<00:02:32.349> four<00:02:32.680> three<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.040> four<00:02:33.810> five<00:02:34.810> six<00:02:35.530> all

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
there we can build all of the other

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.640 
there we can build all of the other
chords<00:03:36.699> in<00:03:36.909> the<00:03:37.629> universe<00:03:38.079> everything<00:03:38.470> you

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
chords in the universe everything you

chords in the universe everything you
can<00:03:38.769> imagine<00:03:38.859> is<00:03:39.280> based<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:40.169> this<00:03:41.169> so<00:03:41.709> hope

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
can imagine is based on this so hope

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.020 
can imagine is based on this so hope
this<00:03:42.370> helps<00:03:43.019> demystify<00:03:44.019> some<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:45.069> what<00:03:45.310> the

this helps demystify some of what the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.030 
this helps demystify some of what the
basics<00:03:46.389> are<00:03:46.569> for<00:03:47.049> learning<00:03:47.260> all<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.919> those

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.399 
on how to do scales you don't need them
anymore<00:03:56.349> just<00:03:57.010> look<00:03:57.159> at<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.400> C<00:03:57.579> scale<00:03:57.819> 3<00:03:58.389> &amp;<00:03:58.510> 4<00:03:58.659> 7

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.589 
anymore just look at the C scale 3 &amp; 4 7
&amp;<00:03:59.530> 8<00:03:59.650> you've<00:04:00.069> got<00:04:00.280> them<00:04:00.459> all<00:04:00.549> right<00:04:00.790> there<00:04:00.819> hope
