explain<00:01:30.270> why<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> clean<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.770> let<00:01:32.340> me

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
explain why I clean them this way let me

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.399 
explain why I clean them this way let me
just<00:01:32.670> say<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.869> debate<00:01:34.110> on

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
just say that there is a big debate on

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.190 
just say that there is a big debate on
how<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> properly<00:01:35.159> clean<00:01:35.400> filter<00:01:35.880> pads<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.360> met

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
how to properly clean filter pads I met

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.929 
how to properly clean filter pads I met
a<00:01:37.229> few<00:01:37.439> people<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:38.009> insist<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.549> simply

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
a few people that insist on simply

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
a few people that insist on simply
squeezing<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> dirt<00:01:39.689> out<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
squeezing the dirt out of them in a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
squeezing the dirt out of them in a
bucket<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> water<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> aquarium<00:01:41.880> they

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
bucket of water from the aquarium they

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
bucket of water from the aquarium they
say<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> prevents<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> loss<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.040> beneficial

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
say this prevents the loss of beneficial

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.200 
say this prevents the loss of beneficial
bacteria

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
bacteria

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
issues with in my aquariums directly
because<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.610> clean<00:01:59.850> my<00:01:59.969> filter<00:02:00.149> pads<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.689> way

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
because I clean my filter pads this way

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
because I clean my filter pads this way
in<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.649> opinion<00:02:01.890> biological<00:02:02.759> media<00:02:03.060> houses

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
in my opinion biological media houses

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.600 
in my opinion biological media houses
your<00:02:03.600> beneficial<00:02:04.140> bacteria<00:02:04.290> your<00:02:05.280> filter

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
your beneficial bacteria your filter

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
your beneficial bacteria your filter
pads<00:02:05.850> aren't<00:02:06.090> meant<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.869> why<00:02:07.049> treat

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
pads aren't meant for that so why treat

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.469 
pads aren't meant for that so why treat
them<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.619> such<00:02:07.829> filter<00:02:08.610> pads<00:02:08.849> polish<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
them as such filter pads polish the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
them as such filter pads polish the
water<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> cleaning<00:02:10.590> them<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.069> bucket<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
water and cleaning them in a bucket of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.100 
water and cleaning them in a bucket of
aquarium<00:02:11.910> water<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.360> by<00:02:12.510> squeezing<00:02:12.870> them

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
aquarium water just by squeezing them

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670 
aquarium water just by squeezing them
does<00:02:13.290> not<00:02:13.319> get

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
does not get

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949 
does not get
the<00:02:13.799> dirt<00:02:14.040> fish<00:02:14.790> waste<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.390> basically<00:02:15.750> all

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the dirt fish waste and basically all

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.780 
the dirt fish waste and basically all
the<00:02:16.079> nasty<00:02:16.560> stuff<00:02:16.620> out<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.069> your<00:02:17.189> filter<00:02:17.549> pads

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the nasty stuff out of your filter pads

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.690 
the nasty stuff out of your filter pads
so<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.870> choice<00:02:19.079> is<00:02:19.260> ultimately<00:02:19.439> yours<00:02:20.129> but<00:02:20.519> I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so the choice is ultimately yours but I

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.369 
so the choice is ultimately yours but I
do<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.269> way<00:02:21.329> moving<00:02:21.930> on

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
do it this way moving on

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.630 
do it this way moving on
take<00:02:22.530> out<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.829> impeller<00:02:23.129> from<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> motor

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
take out the impeller from the motor

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.819 
take out the impeller from the motor
housing<00:02:23.849> don't<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.930> rough<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.319> because

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
housing don't be rough with it because

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.649 
housing don't be rough with it because
the<00:02:25.980> ceramic<00:02:26.370> shaft<00:02:26.609> is<00:02:26.790> very<00:02:27.060> fragile<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
the ceramic shaft is very fragile and

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.110 
the ceramic shaft is very fragile and
can<00:02:28.049> break<00:02:28.200> easily<00:02:28.640> clean<00:02:29.640> all<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.879> slimy

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
can break easily clean all the slimy

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.759 
can break easily clean all the slimy
stuff<00:02:30.389> off<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.780> impeller<00:02:31.049> this<00:02:31.439> is<00:02:31.560> very

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
stuff off the impeller this is very

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.039 
stuff off the impeller this is very
important<00:02:32.250> because<00:02:32.359> not<00:02:33.359> doing<00:02:33.689> this<00:02:33.840> can

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
important because not doing this can

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.569 
important because not doing this can
affect<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.439> performance<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:35.069> your<00:02:35.219> filter

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
affect the performance of your filter

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.300 
affect the performance of your filter

beforehand<00:04:04.079> but<00:04:04.590> I've<00:04:04.709> always<00:04:05.009> found<00:04:05.189> that<00:04:05.430> to

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
beforehand but I've always found that to

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.699 
beforehand but I've always found that to
be<00:04:05.819> messy<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.840> can<00:04:06.989> never<00:04:07.139> judge<00:04:07.500> how

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
be messy and you can never judge how

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.890 
be messy and you can never judge how
much<00:04:07.769> water<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.189> put<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:09.030> all<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.299> do<00:04:09.359> is<00:04:09.509> lift

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
much water to put in so all I do is lift

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.020 
much water to put in so all I do is lift
the<00:04:10.049> front<00:04:10.290> locking<00:04:10.500> bracket<00:04:11.040> up<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.879> you

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the front locking bracket up and as you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.789 
the front locking bracket up and as you
can<00:04:12.180> see<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.479> canister<00:04:12.840> fills<00:04:13.079> up<00:04:13.259> just<00:04:13.560> fine

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
can see the canister fills up just fine

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.649 
can see the canister fills up just fine
make<00:04:14.400> sure<00:04:14.549> you<00:04:14.699> watch<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.090> water<00:04:15.269> level

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
make sure you watch the water level

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.270 
make sure you watch the water level
because<00:04:15.930> as<00:04:16.079> soon<00:04:16.289> as<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.620> gets<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.070> motor

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
because as soon as it gets to the motor

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.460 
because as soon as it gets to the motor
housing<00:04:17.459> lock<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.419> front<00:04:18.659> bracket<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.349> place
