probably has a ton of potential I bet if

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
probably has a ton of potential I bet if
you<00:01:32.490> whipped<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> boost<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.170> bit

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you whipped up the boost a little bit

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
you whipped up the boost a little bit
and<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.890> cone<00:01:35.340> air<00:01:35.520> filter<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.150> thing

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and put a cone air filter on this thing

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.840 
and put a cone air filter on this thing
you<00:01:36.450> probably<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> close<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> 270<00:01:38.369> 280

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
little bit of a functional issue is the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.810 
little bit of a functional issue is the
back<00:01:47.640> seats<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:48.180> tight<00:01:49.399> it's<00:01:50.399> about<00:01:50.490> 30

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
3.2 inches of leg room back here and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.179 
3.2 inches of leg room back here and
that's<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.090> same<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.720> WRX<00:01:55.470> or

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that's about the same as in the WRX or

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.550 
that's about the same as in the WRX or
the<00:01:56.369> speed<00:01:56.610> three<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.020> about<00:01:58.229> three

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the speed three but it's about three

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.350 
the speed three but it's about three
inches<00:01:58.799> less<00:01:59.040> excuse<00:01:59.820> me<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.060> about<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
inches less excuse me it's about the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.260 
inches less excuse me it's about the
same<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.780> WRX<00:02:01.399> but<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> speed<00:02:02.729> 3<00:02:03.030> has

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
same as in the WRX but the speed 3 has

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.840 
same as in the WRX but the speed 3 has
about<00:02:04.200> three<00:02:04.500> inches<00:02:04.799> more<00:02:05.130> libram<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.700> it's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
about three inches more libram so it's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.410 
about three inches more libram so it's
