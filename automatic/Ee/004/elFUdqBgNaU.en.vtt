my<00:01:30.030> face<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.020> bad<00:01:31.230> but<00:01:31.260> I

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
my face now so would be as bad but I

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.140 
my face now so would be as bad but I
already<00:01:32.190> had<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:32.760> out<00:01:32.940> saw<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.640> hairline<00:01:36.120> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
already had that out saw the hairline is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840 
already had that out saw the hairline is
still<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.660> little<00:01:36.960> thick<00:01:37.580> because<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.730> know

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
still a little thick because you know

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.190 
still a little thick because you know
normally<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.540> pull<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.870> a<00:01:39.900> little

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
normally if you just pull out a little

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.720 
normally if you just pull out a little
it's<00:01:40.470> still<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> bland<00:01:41.220> sand<00:01:41.550> and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
it's still kind of bland sand and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.340 
it's still kind of bland sand and
trickles<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> work<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.810> thick<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.050> as

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
trickles down to work it's thick and as

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.960 
trickles down to work it's thick and as
you<00:01:43.440> can<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:43.890> still<00:01:44.190> like<00:01:44.370> a<00:01:44.400> line<00:01:44.760> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you can see is still like a line of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.360 
you can see is still like a line of
demarcation<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.890> wouldn't<00:01:47.250> suggest

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
demarcation there so I wouldn't suggest

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.720 
demarcation there so I wouldn't suggest
like<00:01:47.760> we're<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.120> this<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.480> up<00:01:48.980> but<00:01:49.980> other<00:01:50.430> than
