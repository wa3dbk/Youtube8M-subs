00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
vehicles and they're so powerful that

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.200 
vehicles and they're so powerful that
even<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> caravan<00:00:53.039> brakes<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.789> it's

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
even with the caravan brakes on it's

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.680 
even with the caravan brakes on it's
hardly<00:00:54.629> noticeable<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> driver<00:00:56.690> then

hardly noticeable to the driver then

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930 
hardly noticeable to the driver then
there<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> caravan<00:00:58.500> itself<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
there was the caravan itself and the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.119 
there was the caravan itself and the
second<00:01:00.329> point<00:01:00.539> picked<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.379> caravans

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
second point picked up was that caravans

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.020 
second point picked up was that caravans
that<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> gas<00:01:03.030> spring<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.409> hand<00:01:04.680> lever

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
that have a gas spring on the hand lever

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.640 
that have a gas spring on the hand lever
seem<00:01:06.030> especially<00:01:06.630> susceptible<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
seem especially susceptible to this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.260 
seem especially susceptible to this
problem<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.670> looking<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
problem and we're looking to that a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
problem and we're looking to that a
little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:09.840> later<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.640> fourth<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.970> third

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
little bit more later a fourth a third

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
little bit more later a fourth a third
and<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> fourth<00:01:12.600> point<00:01:13.140> relate<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and a fourth point relate to the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270 
and a fourth point relate to the
breakaway<00:01:15.000> cable<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.860> some<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> bigger

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
breakaway cable on some of the bigger

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.820 
breakaway cable on some of the bigger
cars<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.479> point<00:01:18.810> where<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.259> couple<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
cars the point where you couple the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.520 
cars the point where you couple the
breakaway<00:01:20.369> cable<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> towing<00:01:21.930> bracket<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
breakaway cable to the towing bracket is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.850 
breakaway cable to the towing bracket is
quite<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> long<00:01:23.159> way<00:01:23.369> underneath<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> much<00:01:25.560> so

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
quite a long way underneath so much so

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.020 
quite a long way underneath so much so
that<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.700> whole<00:01:26.880> cable<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:28.259> tight

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
that the whole cable is a bit too tight

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.280 
that the whole cable is a bit too tight
start<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> go<00:01:30.270> around<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.630> corner<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
start to go around a corner and it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
start to go around a corner and it
tightens<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> once<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.880> happens

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
tightens even more and once that happens

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.690 
tightens even more and once that happens
it<00:01:33.689> activates<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> brake<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.460> brake

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it activates the brake and the brake

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
it activates the brake and the brake
lever<00:01:35.970> goes<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.509> fully<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> burning

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
lever goes on fully and so the burning

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.359 
lever goes on fully and so the burning
out<00:01:39.000> begins<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.079> smoke<00:01:40.439> comes<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:41.009> at

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
out begins and the smoke comes out at

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.480 
out begins and the smoke comes out at
the<00:01:41.579> smell<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> terrible<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:43.310> there<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the smell is terrible if there is a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.179 
the smell is terrible if there is a
bearing<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.990> unusual<00:01:46.189> for

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
bearing like this it's not unusual for

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
bearing like this it's not unusual for
the<00:01:47.280> grease<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.820> start<00:01:48.119> melting<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.780> bleed

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the grease to start melting and bleed

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.670 
the grease to start melting and bleed
out<00:01:49.799> from<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.579> whole<00:01:50.759> assembly<00:01:51.439> this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
out from the whole assembly this is a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.440 
out from the whole assembly this is a
caravan<00:01:53.189> brake<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.060> find<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
caravan brake and you would find that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.600 
caravan brake and you would find that
the<00:01:54.600> backing<00:01:55.049> plate<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.619> often<00:01:55.979> crack<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the backing plate would often crack and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.240 
the backing plate would often crack and
a<00:01:56.939> big<00:01:57.149> chunk<00:01:57.450> would<00:01:57.750> come<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a big chunk would come out and on the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.030

so<00:02:02.280> hot<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.610> pieces<00:02:03.210> would<00:02:03.840> fall<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.409> and

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
so hot that pieces would fall off and

then the brake shoes as well they

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.410 
then the brake shoes as well they
wouldn't<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.770> be<00:02:08.099> worn<00:02:08.369> down<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.149> one

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
wouldn't just be worn down like this one

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.840 
wouldn't just be worn down like this one
you<00:02:10.080> would<00:02:10.170> actually<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> metal<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
you would actually see the metal and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.100 
you would actually see the metal and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
a look at this more closely now this

tow this Caravan I just want the tow
ball<00:02:33.990> it's<00:02:34.980> interesting<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.640> we've<00:02:35.790> also

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
ball it's interesting that we've also

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.260 
ball it's interesting that we've also
had<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.480> take<00:02:37.080> off<00:02:37.290> out<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.950> jockey<00:02:38.790> wheel<00:02:39.030> so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
had to take off out the jockey wheel so

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.640 
had to take off out the jockey wheel so
that<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.660> see<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.020> whole<00:02:40.260> way<00:02:40.470> it's

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that you can see the whole way it's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
that you can see the whole way it's
connected<00:02:41.160> up<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.540> correct
