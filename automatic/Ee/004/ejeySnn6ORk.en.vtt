that we would have fun it would be good
and<00:00:17.480> that<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.510> should<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.680> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and that I should you know do a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.529 
and that I should you know do a
big-budget<00:00:20.160> movie<00:00:20.580> instead<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.000> these<00:00:21.300> little

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
big-budget movie instead of these little

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
big-budget movie instead of these little
independent<00:00:22.080> movies<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.430> said<00:00:23.490> okay

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
independent movies and so I said okay

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.050

does<00:00:24.600> iron<00:00:24.930> man<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.949> any<00:00:26.189> superpowers

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
does iron man have any superpowers

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.570 
does iron man have any superpowers
without<00:00:27.720> his<00:00:28.019> iron<00:00:28.230> suit<00:00:28.560> he<00:00:29.010> has<00:00:29.189> no

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
without his iron suit he has no

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.420 
without his iron suit he has no
superpowers<00:00:30.119> without<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> suit<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.189> think

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
superpowers without a suit and I think

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.620 
superpowers without a suit and I think
that's<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> reasons<00:00:33.270> he's<00:00:33.450> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that's one of the reasons he's so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.959 
that's one of the reasons he's so
appealing<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:34.320> he's<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> man<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
appealing because he's just a man you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.100 
appealing because he's just a man you
know<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.500> he<00:00:37.500> creates<00:00:38.149> this<00:00:39.149> amazing<00:00:39.750> version

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
know and he creates this amazing version

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
know and he creates this amazing version
of<00:00:40.230> himself<00:00:40.379> through<00:00:40.950> his<00:00:41.100> own<00:00:41.309> facility<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
of himself through his own facility and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
of himself through his own facility and
intelligence<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.559> that's<00:00:43.770> why<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
intelligence I think that's why the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.740 
intelligence I think that's why the
metaphor<00:00:44.640> resonates<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.360> much<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.719> people

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
metaphor resonates so much with people

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.619 
metaphor resonates so much with people
