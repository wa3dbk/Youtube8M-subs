for ziss toes apocalyptic city this is
my<00:00:13.710> laboratory<00:00:14.610> concepts<00:00:16.369> we'll<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.520> take<00:00:17.640> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
my laboratory concepts we'll just take a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.029 
my laboratory concepts we'll just take a
quick<00:00:17.880> flight<00:00:18.300> around<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.619> roof<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
quick flight around it the roof is

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.670 
quick flight around it the roof is
fairly<00:00:20.460> boring<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.390> kind<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.900> maj<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
fairly boring it's kind of a maj to the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.560 
fairly boring it's kind of a maj to the
houses<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.160> already<00:00:23.609> exist<00:00:23.970> inside<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
houses that already exist inside of the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.170 
houses that already exist inside of the
village<00:00:24.949> but<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.039> course<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.820> some

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
village but of course with the some

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.790 
village but of course with the some
laboratory<00:00:27.689> pillorying<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.410> things<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
laboratory pillorying and things of that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.089 
laboratory pillorying and things of that
nature<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.840> let's<00:00:30.990> take<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.650> quick<00:00:32.070> walk

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
nature so let's take a quick walk

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.790 
nature so let's take a quick walk
through<00:00:33.559> step<00:00:34.559> inside<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:36.870> course<00:00:37.200> we'll<00:00:37.469> see

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
through step inside of course we'll see

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.220 
through step inside of course we'll see
bookshelves<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.149> our<00:00:39.270> storing<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.200> your

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
scientists might need his desk here with

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
scientists might need his desk here with
his<00:00:51.210> bushed<00:00:52.110> idea<00:00:52.469> doesn't<00:00:52.620> take<00:00:52.860> care<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
his bushed idea doesn't take care of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.840 
his bushed idea doesn't take care of
because<00:00:53.250> he's<00:00:53.460> too<00:00:54.059> busy<00:00:54.500> in<00:00:55.760> experiments<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
because he's too busy in experiments and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.889 
because he's too busy in experiments and
such<00:00:57.680> he's<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.910> mushroom<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.629> there

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
such he's got a little mushroom up there

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139 
such he's got a little mushroom up there
we've<00:01:01.079> got<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.949> wither<00:01:02.129> skeleton<00:01:02.760> skull

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
we've got some wither skeleton skull

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.460 
we've got some wither skeleton skull
sitting<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> mantelpiece<00:01:05.810> yeah<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.110> thought

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
sitting on a mantelpiece yeah I thought

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.679 
sitting on a mantelpiece yeah I thought
about<00:01:07.530> sticking<00:01:08.070> some<00:01:08.220> cobwebs<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
about sticking some cobwebs up on the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.660 
about sticking some cobwebs up on the
roof<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.290> still<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> terrible

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
roof and that's still not a terrible

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.390 
roof and that's still not a terrible
idea<00:01:12.229> add<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.770> more<00:01:13.979> shape<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
idea add a little bit more shape to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.469 
idea add a little bit more shape to
there<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.790> bit<00:01:14.909> harder<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> obtain

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
there a little bit harder to obtain

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
there a little bit harder to obtain
they're<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:15.990> terrible<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.470> know<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.920> they

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
they're not terrible I know but they

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
they're not terrible I know but they
take<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.299> work<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.840> trying

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
take a little bit more work just trying

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
take a little bit more work just trying
to<00:01:19.049> use<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.470> pretty<00:01:19.740> basic<00:01:19.979> materials<00:01:20.640> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to use all pretty basic materials of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.609 
to use all pretty basic materials of
course<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.600> say<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.290> use<00:01:22.439> with

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
course I say that and then I use with

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
course I say that and then I use with
their<00:01:22.770> skulls<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> mantel

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
their skulls just up your on the mantel

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.700 
their skulls just up your on the mantel
you<00:01:24.180> could<00:01:24.330> put<00:01:24.509> anything<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.380> not

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you could put anything here that's not

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670 
you could put anything here that's not
necessarily<00:01:26.549> has<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.180> articles<00:01:27.680> in

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
necessarily has to be with articles in

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.460 
necessarily has to be with articles in
these<00:01:29.040> silos<00:01:29.579> ease<00:01:29.790> our<00:01:30.049> experiment<00:01:31.049> chambers

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
these silos ease our experiment chambers

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
these silos ease our experiment chambers
and<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> set<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and this one I set up just a you know a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.230 
and this one I set up just a you know a
cauldron<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:35.340> doing<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.790> experiments

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
cauldron and we doing some experiments

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.710 
cauldron and we doing some experiments
with<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.689> brewing<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.409> whatever<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> over

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
with the brewing or whatever and over

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
with the brewing or whatever and over
here<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.020> other<00:01:40.229> experiments<00:01:40.829> I'll<00:01:41.009> oh

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
here in this other experiments I'll oh

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.730 
here in this other experiments I'll oh
we've<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.720> another<00:01:42.920> portal<00:01:44.360> yep<00:01:45.360> um<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.560> one

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
we've got another portal yep um this one

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.889 
we've got another portal yep um this one
doesn't<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.460> fit<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> space<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
doesn't really fit in the space of the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.630 
doesn't really fit in the space of the
silent<00:01:49.320> whoops<00:01:49.500> didn't<00:01:50.130> mean<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.310> go<00:01:50.369> through

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
silent whoops didn't mean to go through

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.289 
silent whoops didn't mean to go through
the<00:01:50.759> neck<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.729> cut<00:01:53.909> into<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the neck so you have to cut into that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
the neck so you have to cut into that
that<00:01:54.840> wall<00:01:55.079> right<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.710> bit

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
that wall right there a little bit

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
that wall right there a little bit
that's<00:01:56.520> okay<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.600> obsidian<00:01:57.960> doesn't

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that's okay because the obsidian doesn't

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.330 
that's okay because the obsidian doesn't
poke<00:01:58.350> out<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.530> other<00:01:58.710> side<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.990> let<00:02:01.500> me<00:02:01.560> know<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
poke out the other side so let me know a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
poke out the other side so let me know a
small<00:02:02.880> crafting<00:02:03.360> area<00:02:03.600> because<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.020> never

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
small crafting area because you never
