you<00:02:29.820> know<00:02:29.970> or<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.230> could<00:02:31.440> even<00:02:31.590> tell<00:02:31.920> you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
you know or you could even tell you

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.740 
you know or you could even tell you
slime<00:02:33.090> carnage<00:02:33.510> mod<00:02:33.720> oh<00:02:33.960> yes<00:02:34.650> son<00:02:34.980> college<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
slime carnage mod oh yes son college and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.140 
slime carnage mod oh yes son college and
there's<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.870> jump<00:02:37.080> block<00:02:38.330> no<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:40.490> have<00:02:41.490> did<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
there's a jump block no I have did a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.480 
there's a jump block no I have did a
little<00:02:42.390> thing<00:02:42.660> over<00:02:42.960> here<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:44.310> like<00:02:44.460> a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
little thing over here it's like a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.160 
little thing over here it's like a
little<00:02:44.700> challenge<00:02:45.240> huh<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.810> jump

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
little challenge huh you have to jump

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.050 
little challenge huh you have to jump
it's<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:47.010> hard<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.610> jump<00:02:47.880> on

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
it's not that hard you have to jump on

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.370 
it's not that hard you have to jump on
there<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.420> maybe<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.810> could<00:02:48.960> build<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.350> like

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
there and maybe you could build it like

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.330 
there and maybe you could build it like
all<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> way<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.190> not<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.450> high<00:02:52.340> that's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
all the way up not really high that's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.870 
all the way up not really high that's
like<00:02:53.520> an<00:02:53.700> alternative<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.670> stairs<00:02:56.670> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
like an alternative to like stairs is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.840 
like an alternative to like stairs is
rolling<00:02:57.240> like<00:02:57.740> this<00:02:58.740> does<00:02:59.040> make<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.580> go<00:02:59.730> up

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
rolling like this does make you go up

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.300 
rolling like this does make you go up
fast<00:03:00.150> if<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.450> can<00:03:00.600> make<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.810> work<00:03:01.310> properly

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
fast if you can make this work properly

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.360 
fast if you can make this work properly
you<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:02.910> see<00:03:03.120> how<00:03:03.210> far<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.660> can<00:03:03.690> go<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:05.040> is

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
you can see how far you can go up it is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.670 
you can see how far you can go up it is
probably<00:03:05.670> quicker<00:03:05.910> than<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> elevator

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
probably quicker than the elevator

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.860 
probably quicker than the elevator
anyway<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.800> last<00:03:07.980> block<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.370> adds<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.880> called

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
anyway the last block it adds is called

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.650 
anyway the last block it adds is called
a<00:03:10.020> move<00:03:10.260> block<00:03:11.480> mmm<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.940> block<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.240> actually

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
a move block mmm this block is actually

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.280 
a move block mmm this block is actually
pretty<00:03:15.810> nifty<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.950> know<00:03:17.010> why<00:03:17.280> do<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.459> need<00:03:17.640> that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
pretty nifty you know why do I need that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.880 
pretty nifty you know why do I need that
nifty<00:03:19.290> oh<00:03:19.770> yeah<00:03:20.280> there's<00:03:20.580> actually<00:03:21.000> read<00:03:21.770> if<00:03:22.770> I

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
nifty oh yeah there's actually read if I

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
what lamee room and I think it's just a

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.110 
what lamee room and I think it's just a
bit<00:03:36.810> stupid<00:03:37.170> how<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.650> does<00:03:37.770> that<00:03:37.830> but<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.940> this

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
bit stupid how it does that but so this

blocked is it for you look you made
floor<00:03:42.870> would<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.050> go<00:03:43.200> really<00:03:43.380> quick<00:03:43.620> oh<00:03:44.209> I

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
floor would you go really quick oh I

over enough of this there we go you go

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.860 
over enough of this there we go you go
double<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.140> speed<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.500> running<00:03:55.770> Oh<00:03:56.870> Danny

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
double the speed of running Oh Danny

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
called the move block oh yeah maybe look

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.240 
called the move block oh yeah maybe look
yeah<00:04:17.430> I'm<00:04:17.640> gonna<00:04:17.790> make<00:04:18.030> him<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:19.140> LHC<00:04:19.950> out<00:04:20.130> of

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
yeah I'm gonna make him the LHC out of

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.580 
yeah I'm gonna make him the LHC out of
that<00:04:20.400> but<00:04:21.270> there<00:04:21.479> was<00:04:21.630> one<00:04:21.660> thing<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.229> wanted<00:04:22.500> to

that but there was one thing I wanted to

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.890 
that but there was one thing I wanted to
test<00:04:22.830> out<00:04:23.010> before<00:04:23.070> we<00:04:23.460> go

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900
