00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.259 
commentary for modern warfare 2 this
time<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.220> game<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:09.469> storm<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.800> i<00:00:11.429> am<00:00:12.030> using

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
time the game is on storm and i am using

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.680 
time the game is on storm and i am using
scavenger<00:00:13.230> instead<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.799> sleight<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> hand<00:00:14.690> i'm

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
scavenger instead of sleight of hand i'm

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.900 
scavenger instead of sleight of hand i'm
using<00:00:15.870> scavenger<00:00:16.710> because<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.580> more

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
using scavenger because it's just more

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.200 
using scavenger because it's just more
of<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.119> challenge<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.750> general<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.439> think

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
of a challenge in general I think

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.330 
of a challenge in general I think
slightly<00:00:21.210> pan<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.140> makes<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.800> lot

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
slightly pan kind of makes it a lot

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.900 
slightly pan kind of makes it a lot
easier<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:24.060> snipe<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:26.130> stick<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.580> scavenger

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
easier to snipe to stick in on scavenger

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.390 
easier to snipe to stick in on scavenger
or<00:00:27.420> marathon<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.109> something<00:00:28.140> else<00:00:28.650> even

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
or marathon or something else even

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.830 
or marathon or something else even
though<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.820> their<00:00:30.060> benefits<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
though they have their benefits is

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.600 
though they have their benefits is
nowhere<00:00:31.199> near<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.679> helpful<00:00:32.099> as<00:00:32.309> having

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
nowhere near as helpful as having

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
nowhere near as helpful as having
sleight<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> hand<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.110> used<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.410> make

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
sleight of hand so I just used to make

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
sleight of hand so I just used to make
it<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> bit<00:00:34.890> more<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.219> challenge<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.940> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it a bit more of a challenge and this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.819 
it a bit more of a challenge and this
but<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.079> my<00:00:37.320> second<00:00:37.649> game

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
but I think this is my second game

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.540 
but I think this is my second game
trying<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.670> second<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:39.780> third

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
trying to do this second or third

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.979 
trying to do this second or third
actually<00:00:41.550> areas<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:41.969> third<00:00:42.210> game<00:00:42.480> trying<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
actually areas my third game trying to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
actually areas my third game trying to
do<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> old<00:00:44.190> gameplay<00:00:44.879> it's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
do this is actually a old gameplay it's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.639 
do this is actually a old gameplay it's
over<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> month<00:00:45.719> old<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:48.360> i<00:00:48.629> think<00:00:49.170> i<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.500> using

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
over a month old but i think i was using

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
over a month old but i think i was using
my<00:00:49.800> better<00:00:50.010> quality<00:00:50.370> settings<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.940> i

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
my better quality settings for this i

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.510 
my better quality settings for this i
think<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> first<00:00:52.160> games<00:00:53.160> had

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
think this is one of the first games had

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
think this is one of the first games had
recorded<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.210> those<00:00:54.360> settings<00:00:54.719> i<00:00:54.930> hope<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
recorded with those settings i hope it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.020 
recorded with those settings i hope it
was<00:00:55.379> anyway<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:56.940> be

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
was anyway if not then it will be

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.090 
was anyway if not then it will be
slightly<00:00:57.329> worse<00:00:57.629> than<00:00:57.870> usual<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.440> oh<00:00:58.680> and

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
slightly worse than usual but oh and

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
slightly worse than usual but oh and
sorry<00:01:02.100> i've<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.730> new<00:01:02.879> computer<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.739> i

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
sorry i've got my new computer now and i

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.010 
sorry i've got my new computer now and i

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
probably going to do a setup video

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.450 
probably going to do a setup video
tomorrow<00:01:07.020> i'm<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.799> sure<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.280> going

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
tomorrow i'm not sure if this is going

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.399 
tomorrow i'm not sure if this is going
to<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> date<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.750> same<00:01:09.990> day<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.229> i'm

to go up the date the same day as i'm
doing<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.130> it'll<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.000> tomorrow<00:01:12.240> from

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
we're not under in the commentary and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.780 
we're not under in the commentary and
probably<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:16.159> just<00:01:17.159> need<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.430> round<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
probably i just need to get round to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
probably i just need to get round to
doing<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.270> everything<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.810> find<00:01:19.710> my

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
doing it and everything and find my

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.030 
doing it and everything and find my
camera<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.560> won't<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:22.950> be

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
camera and all that it won't really be

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.429 
camera and all that it won't really be
that<00:01:23.250> long<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> cell<00:01:23.850> video<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.630> there

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that long of a cell video because there

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
that long of a cell video because there
isn't<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.950> much<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.220> my<00:01:26.700> setup<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
isn't really that much to my setup I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.179 
isn't really that much to my setup I
mean<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.659> bad<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.229> whatever<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> yeah

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
mean it's not bad but whatever so yeah

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
mean it's not bad but whatever so yeah
this<00:01:32.400> game<00:01:32.640> i'm<00:01:32.790> using<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> bat<00:01:33.420> para<00:01:33.840> 50<00:01:34.200> Cal

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
this game i'm using the bat para 50 Cal

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.649 
this game i'm using the bat para 50 Cal
with<00:01:34.740> scavenger<00:01:35.460> stopping<00:01:35.939> power<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> steady

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
with scavenger stopping power and steady

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.440 
with scavenger stopping power and steady
aim<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.369> i'm<00:01:38.490> using<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> deagle<00:01:39.329> with

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
aim and then i'm using the deagle with

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.719 
aim and then i'm using the deagle with
FMJ<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.229> can't<00:01:40.920> remember<00:01:41.070> while<00:01:41.369> using<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
FMJ I can't remember while using the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.969 
FMJ I can't remember while using the
deagle<00:01:42.150> by<00:01:42.270> went<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> stage<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.530> quite<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
deagle by went for a stage like quite a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
deagle by went for a stage like quite a
while<00:01:44.250> back<00:01:44.460> i<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.759> used<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> use<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.570> every

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
while back i just used to use it every

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
while back i just used to use it every
game<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.680> bad<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.130> gun<00:01:47.310> but

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
game and it's not that bad of a gun but

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.910 
game and it's not that bad of a gun but
it's<00:01:48.360> probably<00:01:49.020> still<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> worst<00:01:49.829> secondary

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
it's probably still the worst secondary

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.350 
it's probably still the worst secondary

why<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.680> school<00:02:04.920> would<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.100> been<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> lot

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
why my school would have been a lot

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.980 
why my school would have been a lot
better<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.909> went<00:02:06.030> against<00:02:06.329> people<00:02:06.659> using

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
better if I went against people using

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.430 
better if I went against people using
those

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
those

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.100 
those
well<00:02:08.130> what<00:02:08.790> we<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:09.090> call<00:02:09.270> cheap<00:02:09.540> tactics

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
well what we would call cheap tactics

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.130 
well what we would call cheap tactics
and<00:02:11.600> photo<00:02:12.600> well<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.120> think<00:02:15.540> at<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.990> point

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and photo well so I think at this point

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.650 
and photo well so I think at this point
they<00:02:16.740> had<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.980> Harrier<00:02:17.370> up<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.940> then<00:02:18.360> they<00:02:18.510> had

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
they had a Harrier up and then they had

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.980 
they had a Harrier up and then they had
a<00:02:18.690> pavelow<00:02:18.990> up<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.780> SAT<00:02:21.930> around

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
a pavelow up and so I just SAT around

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.330 
a pavelow up and so I just SAT around
waiting<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:24.020> because<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.350> didn't<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.160> run

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
waiting and because I didn't want to run

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
waiting and because I didn't want to run
out<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.760> get<00:02:27.000> give<00:02:27.480> them<00:02:27.660> free<00:02:27.900> kills

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
out and just get give them free kills

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
out and just get give them free kills
and<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.980> got<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> predator<00:02:29.700> took<00:02:29.880> out<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and I got a predator took out the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.570 
and I got a predator took out the
Harrier<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.260> knew<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> was<00:02:32.130> only<00:02:32.400> one

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
Harrier and then I knew I was only one

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.490 
Harrier and then I knew I was only one
off<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.940> carrier<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.870> waited<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.350> back

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
off the carrier so I waited to get back

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.710 
off the carrier so I waited to get back
he'll<00:02:34.740> called<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.520> then<00:02:36.150> my<00:02:36.360> Harry<00:02:36.570> I

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
he'll called it in and then my Harry I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.120 
he'll called it in and then my Harry I
would<00:02:36.930> eventually<00:02:37.290> take<00:02:37.500> at<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.740> pave<00:02:37.920> low

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
would eventually take at the pave low

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.500 
would eventually take at the pave low
like<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.490> did<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.850> then<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.420> guy<00:02:39.630> who<00:02:40.080> was

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
like it did and then the guy who was

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.640 
like it did and then the guy who was
drawing<00:02:42.510> with<00:02:42.690> me<00:02:42.870> having<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.320> guy<00:02:43.440> who<00:02:43.500> had

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
drawing with me having the guy who had

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.380 
drawing with me having the guy who had
to<00:02:43.770> pay<00:02:43.950> low<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.400> think<00:02:44.580> he<00:02:44.700> rage<00:02:44.910> quitted

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
to pay low I think he rage quitted

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.930 
to pay low I think he rage quitted
because<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.720> blew<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:45.960> his<00:02:46.200> pave<00:02:46.440> low<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.910> I

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
because I blew up his pave low and so I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.510 
because I blew up his pave low and so I
look<00:02:48.180> back<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.390> was<00:02:48.630> 650<00:02:49.380> 20<00:02:49.710> but<00:02:50.160> when<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.400> does

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
look back it was 650 20 but when it does

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.100 
look back it was 650 20 but when it does
they<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:50.970> wait<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.480> next<00:02:51.660> glad<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.990> get

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
they just wait for the next glad to get

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.370 
they just wait for the next glad to get
a<00:02:52.170> kill<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.480> but<00:02:54.480> something<00:02:55.200> with<00:02:55.350> a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
a kill and but something with a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.750 
a kill and but something with a
scavenger<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:55.890> something<00:02:56.190> I'd<00:02:56.310> probably

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
scavenger is something I'd probably

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.460 
scavenger is something I'd probably
recommend<00:02:57.030> doing<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.870> probably<00:02:58.170> makes<00:02:58.320> you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
recommend doing it probably makes you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.190 
recommend doing it probably makes you
better<00:02:58.710> at<00:02:58.800> sniping<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.430> general<00:02:59.900> it's<00:03:00.900> more

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
better at sniping in general it's more

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.650 
better at sniping in general it's more
of<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.320> challenge<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:03.120> harder<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.450> get

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
of a challenge and it's harder to get

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.200 
of a challenge and it's harder to get
light<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.350> string<00:03:04.710> kills<00:03:05.040> together<00:03:05.460> but<00:03:05.940> I

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
light to string kills together but I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.510 
light to string kills together but I
find<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.110> quite<00:03:07.230> fun<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.830> challenging<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.370> do

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
find it quite fun and challenging to do

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.760 
find it quite fun and challenging to do
I<00:03:08.730> mean<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.420> was<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.780> wasn't<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:10.380> moving

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
I mean I was I wasn't really moving

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.320 
I mean I was I wasn't really moving
around<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.250> much<00:03:11.370> as<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.610> usually<00:03:11.940> would<00:03:12.120> this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
around as much as I usually would this

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.540 
around as much as I usually would this
game<00:03:12.600> i<00:03:12.630> think<00:03:12.840> that's<00:03:13.200> combined<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
game i think that's combined with the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.520 
game i think that's combined with the
fact<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.570> people<00:03:16.020> on<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.350> other<00:03:16.410> team

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
fact that the people on the other team

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.229 
fact that the people on the other team
were<00:03:16.830> all<00:03:16.950> using<00:03:17.100> commando<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:17.970> sort<00:03:18.209> of

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
were all using commando and that sort of

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.690 
were all using commando and that sort of
perks<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.810> because<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:20.070> fact<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:20.459> take

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
perks and because of the fact they take

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.640 
perks and because of the fact they take
so<00:03:20.880> long<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.180> scope<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.900> someone<00:03:22.290> jumps

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so long to scope in that someone jumps

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.110 
so long to scope in that someone jumps
out<00:03:22.800> on<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.400> hard<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.790> kill<00:03:24.030> them

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
out on you it's so hard to kill them

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.449 
out on you it's so hard to kill them
before<00:03:24.209> they<00:03:24.420> kill<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.920> I'm<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.100> get<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.400> a

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
really and it's not really that much of

game<00:05:44.030> I<00:05:45.520> think<00:05:46.720> it<00:05:47.720> might<00:05:47.900> be<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:48.320> booth<00:05:48.620> like<00:05:49.490> I

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
game I think it might be to booth like I

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.610 
game I think it might be to booth like I
don't<00:05:49.760> think<00:05:50.000> it's<00:05:50.090> more<00:05:50.270> than<00:05:50.419> to<00:05:50.570> anyone<00:05:50.960> I

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.240 

have<00:05:54.620> one<00:05:55.130> thing<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.450> I<00:05:56.480> think<00:05:57.070> you<00:05:58.070> should

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
have one thing that I think you should

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.000 
have one thing that I think you should
do<00:05:58.460> though<00:05:58.730> if<00:05:59.000> you<00:05:59.210> scavenge<00:06:00.110> is<00:06:00.350> probably<00:06:00.830> do

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
do though if you scavenge is probably do

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.860 
do though if you scavenge is probably do
you<00:06:01.100> steady<00:06:01.460> aim<00:06:01.669> because<00:06:02.000> it's<00:06:02.540> something

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
you steady aim because it's something

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.340 
you steady aim because it's something
that<00:06:03.050> i<00:06:03.080> think<00:06:03.650> i<00:06:04.430> sort<00:06:04.910> of<00:06:05.000> need<00:06:05.210> i<00:06:05.510> don't<00:06:05.990> i'm

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
that i think i sort of need i don't i'm

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.719 
that i think i sort of need i don't i'm
not<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.620> sort<00:06:06.800> of<00:06:06.830> sniper<00:06:07.040> that<00:06:07.280> lines<00:06:07.520> up

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
not the sort of sniper that lines up

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.310 
not the sort of sniper that lines up
their<00:06:07.970> shots<00:06:08.210> first<00:06:08.479> the<00:06:08.810> steady<00:06:09.050> aim<00:06:09.200> doesn't

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
their shots first the steady aim doesn't

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.290 
their shots first the steady aim doesn't
really<00:06:09.590> help<00:06:09.800> me<00:06:09.950> with<00:06:10.070> that<00:06:10.100> but<00:06:10.490> you<00:06:11.090> get<00:06:11.240> a

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
really help me with that but you get a

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.700 
really help me with that but you get a
lot<00:06:11.360> of<00:06:11.510> close<00:06:11.750> quarters<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:12.140> counters<00:06:12.590> and

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
lot of close quarters and counters and

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.990 
lot of close quarters and counters and
because<00:06:12.919> the<00:06:13.010> amount<00:06:13.160> of<00:06:13.310> time<00:06:13.550> it<00:06:13.580> takes<00:06:13.850> to

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
because the amount of time it takes to

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.400 
because the amount of time it takes to
bring<00:06:14.180> your<00:06:14.360> scope<00:06:14.540> in<00:06:14.780> that<00:06:14.960> steady<00:06:15.229> aim

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
bring your scope in that steady aim

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.140 
bring your scope in that steady aim
really<00:06:15.890> helps<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.520> lot<00:06:16.640> more<00:06:16.820> than<00:06:16.880> it<00:06:17.120> does

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
really helps a lot more than it does

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.260 
really helps a lot more than it does
when<00:06:17.390> you<00:06:17.450> use<00:06:17.630> sleight<00:06:17.870> of<00:06:17.900> hand<00:06:18.229> and<00:06:18.640> i<00:06:19.640> mean

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
when you use sleight of hand and i mean

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.090 
when you use sleight of hand and i mean
i<00:06:20.390> usually<00:06:20.780> use<00:06:21.020> a<00:06:21.140> ninja<00:06:21.500> when<00:06:21.620> i<00:06:21.710> use<00:06:21.860> sleight

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
i usually use a ninja when i use sleight

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.650 
i usually use a ninja when i use sleight
of<00:06:22.130> hand<00:06:22.430> even<00:06:22.790> though<00:06:22.880> i<00:06:22.910> haven't<00:06:23.090> really

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
of hand even though i haven't really

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.900 
of hand even though i haven't really
been<00:06:23.750> using<00:06:24.050> it<00:06:24.140> that<00:06:24.229> much<00:06:24.440> lately<00:06:24.710> but<00:06:25.190> when

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
been using it that much lately but when

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.300 
been using it that much lately but when
i<00:06:25.940> use<00:06:26.210> scavenger<00:06:26.960> or<00:06:27.110> marathon<00:06:27.560> i<00:06:27.800> usually

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
i use scavenger or marathon i usually

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.890 
i use scavenger or marathon i usually
put<00:06:28.490> on<00:06:28.669> steady<00:06:29.240> aim<00:06:29.419> just<00:06:29.570> because<00:06:29.780> i<00:06:29.840> think

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
put on steady aim just because i think

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.920 
put on steady aim just because i think
it<00:06:30.140> helps<00:06:30.440> a<00:06:30.680> lot<00:06:30.860> more<00:06:31.370> than<00:06:31.540> it<00:06:32.540> usually<00:06:32.720> does

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
it helps a lot more than it usually does

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.659 
it helps a lot more than it usually does
when<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.380> slap<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:34.010> and<00:06:34.250> stuff<00:06:34.430> like<00:06:34.610> that

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
when you slap and and stuff like that

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.940 
when you slap and and stuff like that
but<00:06:37.660> I<00:06:38.660> mean<00:06:38.750> it's<00:06:39.080> all<00:06:39.229> to<00:06:39.320> do<00:06:39.440> with<00:06:39.470> personal

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
but I mean it's all to do with personal

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.680 
but I mean it's all to do with personal
preference<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:40.940> you<00:06:41.210> should<00:06:41.390> just<00:06:41.510> use

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
preference and you should just use

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.540 
preference and you should just use
whatever<00:06:41.900> you<00:06:42.110> feel<00:06:42.290> confident<00:06:42.800> with<00:06:43.100> on<00:06:43.370> this

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550

whatever you feel confident with on this
game<00:06:43.729> and<00:06:44.180> that's<00:06:44.300> what<00:06:44.479> I'd<00:06:44.660> usually<00:06:44.960> do

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:51.580 
game and that's what I'd usually do
anyway<00:06:48.490> I<00:06:49.630> need<00:06:50.630> three<00:06:50.840> more<00:06:50.930> kills<00:06:51.290> the<00:06:51.440> win
