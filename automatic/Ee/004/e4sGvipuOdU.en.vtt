00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.880
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.639
 I'll find you today 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.709
 for a new video I think if 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.150
 you look at me right now 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.490
 you know what I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.900
 since sitting very hard so I'm going 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.730
 to talk to you about color lenses 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.880
 I received the kind ones in one in one 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.849
 little envelope like that habulin here 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.500
 and I chose colors a little bit 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.570
 special as you possibly can the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.970
 see and choose nice move I know 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.130
 that it's not really what all the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.079
 chosen world I've been looking a little 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.220
 sure on youtube to see if there was 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.960
 a lot of videos with lenses of 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.570
 color word either I did not look well 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.430
 I have not found one you know that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.760
 I have a great passion for the word so 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.640
 I chose two a very natural and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.440
 a hyper flashy so you will understand 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.360
 that it is the one I wear the hyper 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.980
 flashy or against that more closely here 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.470
 it's one thing that sees itself very very 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.960
 very very loud it's not natural at all 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.420
 it 's anti fantasy I prefer 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.700
 still tell it there are not only 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.930
 lenses also flashy and also 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.220
 fancy it would be if you are 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.250
 really everything and very very 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.860
 natural and hyper flashy and fantasy 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.600
 like that there 's some to and 2 to john hard to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.130
 highest of all by the way 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.300
 hesitated with the roses more happy 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.340
 since I'm a little late and 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.760
 in my head I think you'll know 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.520
 now 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.640
 in short, I chose a bad one 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.650
 natural and a bad let loose fantasy 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.750
 and sincerely it's going maybe you 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.640
 shock what I'm going to say but I have a 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.409
 weak for this one for fantasies 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.630
 because the tear she farts it 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.070
 this king to death and his fun and that's me 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.690
 I like it a lot when something 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.500
 see then that may not be the taste 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.110
 from everyone it might be 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.659
 even people's taste since that's 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.220
 very seeing is not natural as I 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.770
 say it but here I am, I like it a lot 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.820
 Why not occasionally is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.870
 not something that I necessarily 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.729
 will put every day but why not 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.070
 from time to time to have a little 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.560
 fun side and put hyper lenses 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.350
 flashy hyper clairvoyant finally me it's my 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.060
 totally delirious so I'm hyper fan 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.710
 well here I leave you with the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.700
 demonstration these parties do not have the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.740
 mine the most flashy 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.970
 I wish we still have not guaranteed 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.229
 is doing badly and we can clean 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.399
 I will use this product so that 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.720
 I bought written put some 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.700
 drops in the hand I like 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.080
 and then go back to tidy up in his 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.330
 small gift case for storage but a 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.800
 kind of products we can dive the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.570
 lens in here they go everywhere 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.070
 by what we do that for both 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.660
 so I'm going to put the lenses on 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.770
 more natural at first for 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.020
 a talent that will come catch him with 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.400
 his finger like this here and for 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.020
 inflation coming just caught 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.770
 the bottom styles and leave duet and 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.860
 instead come here and take turns 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.510
 go in my eye 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.520
 well we cleaned sometimes went 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.930
 on the so after necessarily your eye 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.459
 will feel something in it 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.080
 so you can clean and sometimes 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.670
 leave a little bit with your eyes closed 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.990
 time that your eye gets used to 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.860
 lens and so obviously I 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.510
 always advise you 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.480
 make up after putting on your lenses 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.520
 me mascara but who is there since 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.320
 this morning but better frankly no 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.030
 no makeup at all you'll have 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.890
 much easier to catch and 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.450
 also catch them open your eye 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.560
 so that's what it gives for 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.720
 most natural lenses 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.790
 frankly I find it very natural 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.840
 the same is pretty did what 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.640
 What I like is that we still see 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.050
 a little bit of my glass and then the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.590
 turn and words I hope you can 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.590
 see well 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.920
 so that's how to put them now 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.900
 I will show you how was 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.670
 withdraw since it's as important 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.920
 since you have to remove your lenses 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.090
 every night really really 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.920
 really so for example and it's not 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.360
 very complicated just reopen his 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.170
 name and become caught thinking and especially 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.100
 especially there are no schedules of 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:04:05.850
 products in the small holster before 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:04:06.510
 put the lenses in with the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.910
 order 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.650
 we get a little notice like this 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.290
 so to teach you how to ask 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.970
 the lens the little precautions the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.769
 little instructions and all that especially a 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.780
 thing before asking has lied it takes 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.400
 absolutely absolutely absolutely you 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.600
 Wash hands as ask 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 lenses with dirty hands you 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.710
 go put bacteria in your eyes 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.690
 it's not very advisable avoided what 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.250
 answer you're walking know what 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.380
 to be sure that the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.120
 lens is fine at the place is not at 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.410
 upside down when you put it on the end 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.330
 of your finger she must make a beautiful 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.280
 race if you see that the lens is 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.990
 a little bit finally I have not a nice curve has 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.360
 crumpled but see she's doing a 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.560
 little bit land on the sides is 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.940
 that she is upside down so forget 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.960
 not put it back to the place in honda 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.669
 put in your eye for theo 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.010
 maximum witter lenses a day is 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.490
 obviously did not sleep with flying 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.590
 leather 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.820
 these are annual lenses that these are 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.070
 annual lenses so you can 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.169
 keep them for a year very things 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.370
 very very very good because it's 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.190
 pretty rare to find denied they 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.200
 are good in these are valid 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.910
 one year after opening admitting that 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.440
 wanted to heal well finally you want 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.210

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.870
 laurel you well kidneys that's fine 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.960
 in their little case with the solution 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.550
 like these one thing does not practice 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.520
 aquatic sport so was not going the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.860
 pool with your lenses sailing wanted 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.060
 remove all that to go to the pool 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.979
 anyway you do not need 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.470
 to have sore eyes yellow or green at 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.020
 red blue any color for 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.120
 the track 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.090
 not therefore remove the facts indicated on 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.099
 the paper but that seems to me so much 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.240
 logical do not share your lenses 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:42.520
 so kind if your girlfriend tells me ah 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.539
 they are too well denied I can 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 try it norway hymn possible no no 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.050
 no no no we do not share these 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.280
 lenses what goes in our eyes is not going 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.419
 not in someone else's eyes 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.940
 and do not come back in our eyes 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.639
 impossible impossible impossible 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.199
 and then he did note did not wear 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.210
 your lenses if this one seems room 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.190
 or damaged logic so see 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.199
 that it is cut in half and comes from 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.250
 put and not wearing your 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.139
 lenses if you take a medicine 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.550
 eyepiece so if you put drops 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.789
 roses or I do not know what 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.590
 avoid madball anti also now 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.659
 it's better to pay attention and when 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.110
 you wear you put your lenses so 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.849
 you see that tingling in at 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.360
 hard eyes more than ten minutes and still 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.430
 10 minutes 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.860
 it's really a lot remove the what 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.020
 me it pecks me 20 seconds what and 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.240
 after it's good it's my eyes are 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.469
 regulars and I will not say I 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.150
 more meaning because it might be 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:38.919
 a little lying but frankly if 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.530
 we do that I feel them almost more 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.300
 is really that if I close my eyes that 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.349
 I reopen them that place the lens 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.240
 get back we're going to say there I go there 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:50.289
 meaning but otherwise like that I have 100 not 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.060
 even when I blink 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.710
 I do not feel anything at all here I hope 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.400
 in any case that you have liked and I 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.599
 make big kisses 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:06.930

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:17.850
