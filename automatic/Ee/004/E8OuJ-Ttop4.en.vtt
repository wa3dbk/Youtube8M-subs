00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 you have a flyer for dealer roses what 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.370
 are the pros and contras of pure 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.930
 Forecasts in the belief that is mine 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.889
 favorite big is also what 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.230
 smart lazy read if you have one 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.269
 old walnut at home if you have 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.300
 An old fruit tree is called here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.160
 s most the old pattern fruit trees the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
 partly no longer used 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
 then do not say cut but 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.650
 basically not but sets there 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 a rose down 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 the most beautiful strongest growing 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 rambler rose means there's money growing in 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.750
 hold on for a year 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 cm unbelievable is really so you have 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 one a walnut for example so 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 big diameter in about always 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 remove one meter you put the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.399
 Rose and then the first three years 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.280
 nothing happens and worry about it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.449
 the blomberger knew he told the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 has to establish itself 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.410
 but if it grows then come 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570
 Fingers the gear and shoot in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 the crown is the desert beetle anchor 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 a spray climate branches and if 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.159
 We meet again in about 78 years 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.729
 then the walnut tree is a rose tree 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.040
 become 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.990
 this is more effective with roses 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 Rose blossoms that was an experience in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.869

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.020
 At the end of may this garden trip is always 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.759
 a owner over 85 years and the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.689
 against the count and sedo at the end of the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.479
