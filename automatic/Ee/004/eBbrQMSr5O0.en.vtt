00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
so effing should be fine unless that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.100 
so effing should be fine unless that
site<00:02:38.430> goes<00:02:38.700> down<00:02:38.730> or<00:02:39.030> something<00:02:39.510> happens<00:02:39.930> but

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
site goes down or something happens but

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.130 
site goes down or something happens but
it<00:02:40.290> generally<00:02:40.740> don't<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.810> yeah<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.050> I'm

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
it generally don't but and yeah so I'm

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.860 
it generally don't but and yeah so I'm
should<00:02:43.350> do<00:02:43.500> these<00:02:43.680> images<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.780> can<00:02:45.780> have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
should do these images and you can have

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.440 
should do these images and you can have
it<00:02:45.960> as<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.140> row<00:02:46.380> or<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.370> zip<00:02:47.820> but<00:02:48.090> I'm<00:02:48.180> gonna<00:02:48.300> make

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
it as a row or a zip but I'm gonna make

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.180 
it as a row or a zip but I'm gonna make
it<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.710> don't<00:02:49.890> have<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.070> have

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
it is it because you don't have to have

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.040 
it is it because you don't have to have
someone<00:02:50.760> who<00:02:50.880> downloads<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.420> doesn't<00:02:51.720> have<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
someone who downloads it doesn't have to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.470 
someone who downloads it doesn't have to
have<00:02:52.230> winrar<00:02:52.710> or<00:02:52.740> any<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.670> extracting
