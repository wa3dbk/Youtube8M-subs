learned I learned online through some
videos<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.100> courses<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> I've<00:01:12.450> been<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.869> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
videos or courses and I've been in this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
videos or courses and I've been in this
situation<00:01:13.350> many<00:01:13.680> times<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:15.330> completely

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
situation many times and I completely

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.719 
situation many times and I completely
agree<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.439> study<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> way

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
agree to this study but there is a way

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.510 
agree to this study but there is a way
to<00:01:17.970> make<00:01:18.420> online<00:01:18.750> education<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:20.040> effective

to make online education more effective

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
to make online education more effective
the<00:01:20.670> solution<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> add<00:01:21.780> interaction

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the solution is to add interaction

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.170 
the solution is to add interaction
interaction<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> teacher<00:01:23.700> with

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
interaction with the teacher with

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
interaction with the teacher with
