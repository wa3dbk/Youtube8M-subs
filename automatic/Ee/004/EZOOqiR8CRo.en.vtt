00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good stacy arming with this 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.580
 Welcome to the channel and welcome to a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.710
 new newspaper guys in a new top 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.480
 5 in this case is I bring the top 5 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.620
 pokemon dainese but as always before 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.990
 to begin with I have to say that the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.670
 goal match are 1000 likes guys 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.049
 a thousand little hands up so if you really 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.119
 you like the video, let's see if 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.590
 we can match or even overcome and as 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.150
 always be redundant to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.949
 This cap is in my humble opinion that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.960
 you may have given that is very 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.400
 different from yours and does not have 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.260
 what to match or resemble so put 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.470
 your top 5 pokémons haines in the box 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.040
 welcome comments to the top 5 pokemon 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.040
 saints 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.290
 in the fifth and last place we have 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.060
 dare that good apart from being a 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.010
 pokémon that can give us a little bit 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.600
 cube in competitive if it's called 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.730
 you understand by cube your combination of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.190
 colors is wonderful and makes it be 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.260
 pretty nice is that gray color and 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.330
 red buff that combination really made me 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.370
 it also charms its appearance points out that it is 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.290
 a pretty powerful Pokémon and they leave 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.060
 inhibit that with a little bit of bad milk 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.320
 that's why this pokemon takes the 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.320
 position number 5 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.229
 in position number 4 we have char 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.810
 hoist that as many of you know my pokemon 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.609
 favorite and is that even though this 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.350
 pokemon in its sainz form and some les 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.329
 remember a horrid gargoyle to me 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.909
 still like and also being a nest 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.189
 Acquires 90% more of your app but still 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.409
 well there are many pokemon saints with more their 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.780
 angel why this pokemon under my 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.780
 opinion takes place number 4 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.759
 entering the podium we go with the third 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.500
 pokemon of this top and I've decided to put 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.780
 to my lot and that is a pokémon that already 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.490
 by itself it's nice but if we add the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.350
 mixture of silver and gold that 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.939
 they have their sainz form and makes this 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.920
 be one of the most beautiful pokemon that 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.600
 there are also if we mix it with your 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.580
 great potential makes it a 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.110
 explosive mixture apart from helping us in 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.850
 the fighting will help us win all 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.280
 the contests that we consider without 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.280
 certainly deserves this great position number 3 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.850
 in the second place and approaching the 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.650
 final we have here now 2 which is maybe 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.060
 the most famous shiny and that is not for 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.980
 less because apart from having appeared 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.540
 in the anime countless times 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.160
 appeared in all Pokémon games 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.840
 that takes place in the Giotto region of 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.000
 mandatory way we are going to make a 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.620
 review appeared in gold in silver in 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.570
 crystal in gold goal in silver soulsilver 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.400
 finally and in a few four months 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.290
 also so does the most 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.000
 easy to capture and maybe the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.740
 less valuable but here we are for 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.300
 judge their backs their beauty as what 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.560
 you want to say so that's why it's 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.560
 to this second place 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
 and for the champion of champions we have 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.540
 sacred a primal and that is to me 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.010
 They said the crumbs had a lot of swag 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.140
 is that I do not know if you know but this 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.420
 pokemon in its original form in addition 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.300
 sainz and although it is impossible at the moment 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.610
 get legally in this little color 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.380
 so pretty has been stomping already 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.750
 which is one of the pokemon that most 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.310
 distinguish perhaps in our hearts 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.470
 so that's why he decided to put crotone 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.269
 first of all that apart from my shiny 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.120
 favorite is my legendary pokemon 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.430
 Favourite 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.409
 and up here guys the top 5 today 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.540
 remember that it has been the top 5 pokemon 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.519

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.019

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.519

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.019

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.930
 surely applause from the 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.310
 public or something like that 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.569
 in short guys this has been all for today 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.000

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.890
 they're good, I like you, so let's go 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.120
 we can match or exceed and because I think 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.180

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.440
