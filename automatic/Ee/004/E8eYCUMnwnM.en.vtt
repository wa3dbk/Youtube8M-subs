00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.429
 they existed or not the dinosaurs look 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:15.179
 answers for all questions 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:17.340
 let's talk without knowing 2012 welcome to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.670
 this 2012 cycle of let's talk without knowing 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 this hive of doubt where we the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.380
 bees queens we will make honey from the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.390
 truth that we will deliver it to you 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 so that a little light in the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 darkness of their lives and today just 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.000
 with this qualified panel that we 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.780
 we are proud to have you all here 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.510
 starting with Miguel Granados 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.309
 what career did you leave this summer design 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.700
 of white clothing for albinos with 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.489
 caste and because you left it there was no niche 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.649
 it's already an analysis and there were 34 albinos by 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.770
 country and I had to throw the other way 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.810
 eduardo beltrÃ¡n licensed in almost everything 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.130
 what more presentation 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:07.120
 Juan Faerman painter of snowy jeans 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.490
 and natalia natalia sauber pilot 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.110
 wings and today this theme that brings us together 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.140
 that luckily we had more than three 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.260
 months to elaborate it to rethink it 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 to see it and once again that is the subject 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.560
 this one 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.189
 there were dinosaurs that is a 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.930
 topic that I was investigating I'm 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.390
 I'm getting there getting hand of 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.780
 Boys 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.240
 this lie where there is a picture of a 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
 dinosaur a civil registry where it 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.430
 he scored a dinosaur a veterinarian of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.060
 dinosaurs who bovine who in 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 lie because I'm going to put together 45 skeleton 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.009
 of cow and I have the bug that I want 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.630
 to be more like hashish was keeping you 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 I call to your type drop bone 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.850
 rib that I put three leg bones 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.940
 I put you head and there is a saying that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.409
 go to this site 60 million ago 70 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.450
 millions of years 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.179
 I do not agree so they are also 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.429
 well and the proof is that for me the 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.980
 dinosaurs will eat very large and very 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.930
 clumsy they were like an easy prey of their 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.610
 enemies then dinosaur was 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.680
 evolving it was doing every time 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.900
 so little was it that he left 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.730
 mixing with the chickens made the day of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.230
 today that dinosaurs and chickens 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.879
 they are mixed and nobody can 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.769
 distinguish them the proof is that when 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.530
 go to the supermarket and buy formica 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.910
 dinosaur has a lot of support maybe 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.280
 maybe he stepped on chicken dinosaurs 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.690
 if we send ourselves back in the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.970
 history in the years on the line 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.459
 chronological and almost everyone we 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.019
 compare with the monkey we do not come from the monkey 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.530
 because we can not come from the dinosaur 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.910
 since we have so many ways of acting 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.829
 similar not because, for example, I have 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.989
 A friend walking through the woods I want 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.430
 an apple that is tall who comes the 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.920
 herbivore my friend one tall two 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.379
 meters would be the brontosaurus I put myself 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.560
 I do not know Tuesday 3 in the morning strong 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.019
 apache with the car in each one of here 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.550
 another from here and another from the front that is that 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.620
 the velociraptor 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.930
 because it 's because the monkey and not the 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.300
 dinosaur to go back to the subject this 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.020
 that there is not a record we remember 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.690
 that at that time fell like a stone 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.880
 I do not know where and it's messed up everything is 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.040
 how do you want to build a chicken just 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.480
 after you ate it, it's not easy, 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.250
 there is that everything died that ended everything with 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.820
 with the fireball which opened 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.880
 market and with this guy it 's no longer that 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.190
 this one had the pasta so where is the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.980
 book who drew where farewell printed 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.430
 someone that there is nothing to do with 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.460
 that plays that draws the type of 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.640
 I do not have the post said interns saurio 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:54.900
 I do not know what to say, boyfriend 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.989
 brontosaurus tyrannosaurus saurio 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.370
 a dinosaur 60 thousand years ago 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.680
 generated when here is the footprint of 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.720
 the legs of the guy was the guy with the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.540
 stick with the little brain and he takes out 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.269
 looks of a tooth I do not need this 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.269
 this a lie that has compared to 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.459
 men to sell without a movie and 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.160
 pochoclos that's all the time he says 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.130
 I also have a question that goes like this 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.729
 big dinosaurs imagine how 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.729
 it would be the chota 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.100
 obelisk size 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.990
 sure assuming it was a 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.810
 proportionality between the size of the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.560
 animal and the size of its organs and 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.120
 the rest 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.120
 the eggs like the Australian tanks 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.850
 dragged them let's say the size by 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.620
 that went extinct taking for granted 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.620
 that existed in game form if not 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.600
 could reproduction and why be so so 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.910
 selfish and think that before the big band 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.560
 they are worse than us and why think 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.330
 that before they live since there is no record 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.910
 we are more evolved 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.190
 because maybe before this explosion 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.170
 have been more advanced than us 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.270
 that's why it's not the analog file of 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.430
 the dinosaurs and if digital and its people 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.160
 when they understand that one must have 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.160
 one can do 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:44.510
 to right like me on top of a horse 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:53.530
 a photon looks at me with a weight where there is 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:53.530
 a before who puts a name 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.560
 who would listen to him come here 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:06.020
 I was already taking the little stick in my hand 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.370
 no one listened to him is heard when 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.260
 someone heard that someone will send the 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:15.380
 spoon of the dinosaurs did not exist 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.640
 I do not think started is expensive 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.500
 another may be that the last dinosaur 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.330
 because the time of an extinction is not 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.980
 all die at the same time one remains 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.070
 there must be a panda out there maybe the 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.650
 last one was very sad very depressed and 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.930
 burned all the records not all the 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.790
 story that they were writing and they 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.380
 dismissed as when the old titanic 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.380
 throw the necklace into the water to do 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.870
 I do not know why they lived very fast because 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.259
 at that time time was tyrant and 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.259
 blood 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.350
 good friends I do not know if someone has something 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:57.240
 more to add 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:59.370
 fixedly fitting this I think that 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.280
 we are able to round off this 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.530
 topic that basically the conclusion that 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.210
 we have come here the dinosaurs for 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.630
 the only thing they serve is to sell 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:12.210
 movies and pochoclos we have neither the 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.890
 minimum certainty that they have existed 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.420
 that in this way after delving into 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.060
 this topic we say goodbye until the 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:21.170
 next of this cycle called 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.170
 let's talk and much more
