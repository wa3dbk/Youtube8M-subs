00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
alright here we have a walk-around of a

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.280 
alright here we have a walk-around of a
case<00:00:02.060> gx460<00:00:03.060> hydraulic<00:00:03.540> estimator<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.259> a

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
case gx460 hydraulic estimator this is a

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.200 
case gx460 hydraulic estimator this is a
pretty<00:00:04.560> good-sized<00:00:04.980> machine<00:00:05.370> coming<00:00:06.000> from

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
pretty good-sized machine coming from

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.320 
pretty good-sized machine coming from
the<00:00:06.359> case<00:00:06.569> line<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.080> don't<00:00:07.200> see<00:00:07.500> very<00:00:07.680> many

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
the case line you don't see very many

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.730 
the case line you don't see very many
this<00:00:09.330> size<00:00:09.540> you're<00:00:09.809> bigger<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.440> case

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.260 

pretty<00:00:15.340> scratch<00:00:16.030> stuff<00:00:17.040> back<00:00:18.180> looks<00:00:19.180> like

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
pretty scratch stuff back looks like

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.660 
pretty scratch stuff back looks like
this<00:00:19.570> one's<00:00:19.810> been<00:00:20.050> ran<00:00:20.560> into<00:00:20.830> a<00:00:20.860> couple<00:00:21.369> things

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
this one's been ran into a couple things

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.900 
this one's been ran into a couple things
some<00:00:22.300> point<00:00:22.510> in<00:00:22.630> time

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
some point in time

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.140 
some point in time
take<00:00:24.910> a<00:00:24.939> look<00:00:25.119> up<00:00:25.210> in<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.390> cab<00:00:25.600> in<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.810> minute

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
take a look up in the cab in a minute

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.250 
take a look up in the cab in a minute
but<00:00:28.150> here<00:00:28.480> we<00:00:28.570> go<00:00:28.599> we<00:00:28.720> got<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:28.930> pretty<00:00:29.110> wide

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
but here we go we got a pretty wide

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.980 
but here we go we got a pretty wide
bucket<00:00:30.270> yeah<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.300> good<00:00:31.449> sized<00:00:31.600> bucket<00:00:31.750> this<00:00:31.930> is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
bucket yeah a good sized bucket this is

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.630 
bucket yeah a good sized bucket this is
probably<00:00:32.379> two<00:00:32.590> three<00:00:32.830> yard<00:00:33.040> buckets<00:00:33.460> not

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
probably two three yard buckets not

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.640 
probably two three yard buckets not
bigger<00:00:33.850> this<00:00:34.360> one<00:00:34.480> actually<00:00:34.690> has<00:00:34.989> a<00:00:35.020> quick

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
bigger this one actually has a quick

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.570 
bigger this one actually has a quick
coupler<00:00:35.949> on<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.250> right<00:00:36.670> here<00:00:36.879> and<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:39.370> looks

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
coupler on it right here and that looks

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.100 
coupler on it right here and that looks
like<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:39.820> could<00:00:39.940> possibly<00:00:39.970> be<00:00:40.510> off<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.870> dealer

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
like it could possibly be off the dealer

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.979 
like it could possibly be off the dealer
hydraulic<00:00:41.620> I'm<00:00:41.770> not<00:00:41.890> sure<00:00:42.100> so<00:00:42.840> machine<00:00:43.840> could

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
hydraulic I'm not sure so machine could

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.060 
hydraulic I'm not sure so machine could
have<00:00:44.080> been<00:00:44.170> hooked<00:00:44.320> up<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.590> a<00:00:44.620> breaker<00:00:44.920> or

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
have been hooked up to a breaker or

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.320 
have been hooked up to a breaker or
something<00:00:45.430> along<00:00:45.580> those<00:00:45.760> lines<00:00:45.879> at<00:00:46.180> some

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
something along those lines at some

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.750 
something along those lines at some
point<00:00:46.540> in<00:00:46.660> time<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:47.800> take<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.040> quick<00:00:48.399> look<00:00:48.610> at

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
point in time go take a quick look at

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.090 
point in time go take a quick look at
your<00:00:48.790> other<00:00:49.120> side<00:00:49.329> of<00:00:49.480> your<00:00:49.570> machine<00:00:53.100> yeah

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
your other side of your machine yeah

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.000 
your other side of your machine yeah
there<00:00:54.820> you<00:00:54.880> go

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
there you go

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.500 
there you go
and<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:57.059> let's<00:00:57.239> take<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.540> look<00:00:57.720> up<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> cab

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
and now let's take a look up in the cab

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.760 
and now let's take a look up in the cab
your<00:01:00.510> swing<00:01:00.750> motor<00:01:00.989> hydraulic<00:01:01.440> lines<00:01:01.590> in

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
your swing motor hydraulic lines in

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:13.530 
your swing motor hydraulic lines in
there

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.630 

sound<00:01:14.470> like<00:01:14.590> completely<00:01:15.010> back<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.190> that<00:01:15.430> him

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
sound like completely back to that him

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.540 
sound like completely back to that him

uh engages all your hydraulics basic
excavator<00:02:16.050> controls<00:02:16.500> nothing<00:02:17.040> special<00:02:17.580> there

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
excavator controls nothing special there

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.710 
excavator controls nothing special there
and<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.900> believe<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.720> quick

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and I do believe that this is a quick

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.010 
and I do believe that this is a quick
coupler<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.830> showed<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.459> there<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.900> is

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
coupler as I showed up there so this is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.780 
coupler as I showed up there so this is
a<00:02:25.080> pretty<00:02:25.320> nice-looking<00:02:25.530> machine<00:02:25.890> guys<00:02:26.400> um

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
a pretty nice-looking machine guys um
