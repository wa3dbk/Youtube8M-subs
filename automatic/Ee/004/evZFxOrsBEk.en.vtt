00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and I write because I do not have anything better than 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.120
 do because I need you to know the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.610
 truth and because it's the only thing that he 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.469
 let's do what happened is so bizarre 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.480
 paranormal and illogical that could not 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.210
 imagine that many people believe what 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm about to tell I'm a writer of a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.840
 very demanding editorial just had 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 finished a good book of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.070
 self-improvement but I had mistakes and I 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 had forced to correct them for 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.660
 deliver it again a week later 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 I was always a lover of animals and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 I'm not in my hometown I came because 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 in this city is the main campus 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.480
 from the publisher, I'm just traveling and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.790
 I come from afar I could not bring my 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
 pets throughout the trip I'm in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 a small apartment with no company 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.329
 direct access to a pet store for 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.760
 get a temporary partner and not 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 feel alone while I was locked 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.750
 fixing the small errors of the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.329
 Book way to the place I ran into 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.579
 a cat that did not have eyes strangely 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.460
 It did not scare me, it even gave me pity 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.379
 so I decided to take it right now 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.449
 I regret having done it I took it to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 revise a veterinarian to see 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.930
 that I did not have something serious I just had one 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 small infection 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.240
 but I was just emerging so 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.460
 it was easy to eradicate it in the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.050
 veterinarian it was easy to notice that I was 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.360
 the only one who was not disgusted by 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.490
 cat's situation I never named him 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.620
 both because he did not give me time and as 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 I still did not want to be so fond of 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.210
 he once at home I let him play 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 free for the apartment despite 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.410
 being blind seemed to know exactly 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.050
 where he was and how to get around the place 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.820
 it did not seem strange to me I just thought about what 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.130
 arrogant that he would feel the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 poor animal while he played 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 I started to correct the first mistakes 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 of the book on my laptop immediately I 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.640
 I went to sleep everything was normal in the morning 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.310
 next when everything started believe me or 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.410
 not when I woke up there was in front of me 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.600
 flipping directly to the ceiling a 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.820
 man looking me in the eyes standing to a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.950
 side of my bed or that I thought I was doing 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.399
 because that man did not have eyes with that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.990
 see me I only saw a couple of empty basins 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.300
 scream like any normal person what 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.610
 would he be paralyzed in that man 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.280
 he drops to the floor to walk four 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.110
 legs curls up in a corner pulls out of 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.620
 your bag a notebook with a pen and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.019
 begins 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.709
 to write I had the strength to raise the 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.750
 head 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.970
 the man did not react little by little me 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.099
 I raised taking advantage of the concentrated 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.680
 was he in his notebook I went to the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.989
 door and I tried to open it had something 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.090
 down who adored him try to get him out 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.670
 every time with more desperation and without 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.950
 no positive effect I approached the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.959
 window was covered with a lot of paper 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.150
 notebook was the base on which there was 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.099
 I started writing my book just 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.099
 few rays of light entered what 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.750
 enough to light the room 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.090
 I tried to remove them but they seemed to be 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.459
 perfectly clinging to the window the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.260
 hit without a good result I flipped and 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.359
 from his corner the man was 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.180
 staring with the strong 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.280
 inner darkness of his eyes with much 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.250
 afraid and trembling too much I struggled 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.010
 in asking who you are what you want from 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.170
 I received a loud meow in return 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.359
 he thought a bit and looked a little 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.940
 the fourth still trembling and with his gaze 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.549
 nonexistent fixed and penetrating on top of 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.250
 I did not see the blind cat anywhere 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.470
 then I noticed what that so much 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.430
 watching my cat was noticing that I 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.530
 I had realized 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.810
 what was happening he approached me 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.420
 desperate I tried to get away from him in 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.189
 vain and cooed with me purring to 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.829
 these heights I was about to 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.200
 cry when I saw you fell asleep I tried 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.390
 think of any solution at that time 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.760
 I could do nothing, if I moved safely 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.340
 he would wake up without knowing how or why 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.170
 I fell asleep I woke up and he was 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.099
 new in your corner writing in your 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.500
 small notebook 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.510
 this time turning to me several times 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.849
 to then continue writing in his 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.250
 notebook I got up this time with more 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.340
 confidence because I noticed that he did not plan 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.620
 hurt me half the environment became the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.599
 panic again I was locked in my 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.120
 own room could not go out to the 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.489
 kitchen did not have to eat while 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.650
 I thought this I heard a little crunch 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.650
 it was the stomach of the cat both 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.659
 we turn to the same point his tummy later 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.790
 he turned to see me without anything 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.799
 do and I with nerves on edge 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.049
 his dark gaze so penetrating I told him 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.449
 a bit stutterer I can not go out to the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.580
 cook alone if you let me out we can 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.010
 eat to hear this I watch myself for two 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.360
 seconds more and went back to his notebook I thought 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.639
 and look for solutions 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.280
 there was none was and I'm still locked 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.650
 here with him I could only think of one thing 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.810
 in a single plan that will respect me in 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.210
 less than a week the publisher would notice 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.729
 that does not appear would try to contact me 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.830
 he would not answer they would talk to the police and 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.110
 break in and have here if the cat could 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.240
 become human or humanoid or what 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.219
 any case that may go back to what 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.620
 before it was then it will seem that 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.629
 I just locked myself in here and the 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.210
 cat will be innocent and will catch 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.370
 someone else at this time I start to 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.469
 write this so that when they enter 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.870
 here and see me starved lean 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.759
 this and take care of the damn cat have 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.919
 after three days of the last 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.259
 I wrote starving and it seems that 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.930
 he too but does nothing 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.539
 writing keeps watching me look like 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.180
 that analyzes me I'm your experiment I'm your 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.759
 test doll that he wants from me because 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.340
 does this I did not go to the only one who 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.409
 has done I want to get out of here I want that 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.870
 that cat away from me I can not 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.120
 do nothing I would not change anything I will continue 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.550
 stuck here if I kill him I must follow his 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.950
 game finish your test maybe so I 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.560
 let out perhaps so be free 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.110
 I just have to wait to let him finish 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.090
 do not worry and keep calm I'm 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.670
 on the verge of madness help please 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.670
 help help me I do not want to continue here 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.100
 help text found next to a body 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.230
 Within the department the body 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.840
 found in the bed about him a cat 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.030
 black and without eyes to the body was missing 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.950
 parts of your skin under your hands 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.050
 there were leftovers of meat and most 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.900
 creepy it seemed that someone 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.060
 the policemen had ripped their eyes out 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.920
 before reading this they believed that stress 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.810
 had taken the writer to the edge of the 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.880
 madness to lock himself alone and 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.220
 feed your cat and yourself with your 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.260
 own meat the newspaper found a 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.930
 side of the corpse hinted another 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.060
 thing as soon as the cops entered the 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.120
 fourth the cat turned and looked at them with 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.710
 deep darkness of their empty sockets 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.110
 He stared at one of the cops there 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.450
 present and strangely that was the 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.650
 only one who possessed no panic took the 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.800
 cat in his arms while 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.540
 they recorded the place when everyone left and 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.790
 before someone could read the 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.100
 daily that police went straight to his 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.000
 house with the feline for four 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.350
 days you do not have 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.350
 news of him or his family
