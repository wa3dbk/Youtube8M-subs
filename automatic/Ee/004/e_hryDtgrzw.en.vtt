you're doing is draining all the excess
 water<00:03:32.579> out<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.910> them<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.540> fluids

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
 water out of them and fluids

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.509 
 water out of them and fluids
and<00:03:34.349> you're<00:03:34.680> going<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:34.889> be<00:03:35.010> ending<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.340> with

with lean muscle there so you can see
all<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.560> all<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.099> veins<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.819> sinews<00:03:39.450> and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
all the all the veins and the sinews and

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.509 
all the all the veins and the sinews and
the<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.319> tendons<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.040> all<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.220> rest<00:03:41.400> of

the and the tendons and all the rest of
it<00:03:41.609> okay<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.919> so<00:03:43.919> muscle<00:03:44.459> mass<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:45.450> just

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
it okay and so muscle mass just just

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.190 
it okay and so muscle mass just just
doesn't<00:03:46.410> go<00:03:46.560> okay<00:03:47.160> water<00:03:48.090> retention<00:03:48.419> fluid

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
doesn't go okay water retention fluid

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.099 
doesn't go okay water retention fluid
retention<00:03:49.319> goes<00:03:50.069> quite<00:03:50.340> quickly<00:03:50.450> okay<00:03:51.450> fat

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
retention goes quite quickly okay fat

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.000 
retention goes quite quickly okay fat
goes<00:03:53.150> second<00:03:54.150> quickly<00:03:54.480> muscle<00:03:55.290> mass<00:03:55.440> takes<00:03:55.919> a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
goes second quickly muscle mass takes a

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.009 
goes second quickly muscle mass takes a
long<00:03:56.190> time<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.760> lose<00:03:56.970> okay<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.870> first
