00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
bag to have a zipper on the top you can
bend<00:00:45.960> over<00:00:46.379> you're<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.800> worried<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.250> your

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

things<00:00:47.850> falling<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:50.570> losing<00:00:51.570> something

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
things falling out and losing something

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.920 
things falling out and losing something
to<00:00:51.930> hoard<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.649> wallet<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:53.129> keys

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
to hoard and like your wallet your keys

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.630 
to hoard and like your wallet your keys
so<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.110> why<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.010> never<00:00:56.190> full<00:00:56.460> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
so that's why I know the never full is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.330 
so that's why I know the never full is
really<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.030> popular<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.410> after<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
really really popular but for me after I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
really really popular but for me after I
had<00:00:59.550> kids<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.840> honestly<00:01:01.079> don't<00:01:01.320> use

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
had kids I really honestly don't use

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.979 
had kids I really honestly don't use
mine<00:01:01.829> ever<00:01:02.010> full<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.539> don't

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
mine ever full as much because I don't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.660 
mine ever full as much because I don't
like<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> open<00:01:04.680> atmosphere<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> bag

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
like that open atmosphere of the bag

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000 
like that open atmosphere of the bag

those things fit very comfortably and
also<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> size<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.700> tabouli<00:02:00.229> GM<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
also the size on the tabouli GM so the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.399 
also the size on the tabouli GM so the
larger<00:02:02.399> size<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> Palermo

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
larger size there and then the Palermo

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920 
larger size there and then the Palermo
PM<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.250> very<00:02:05.520> comparable<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.479> Tivoli's<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
PM is very comparable the Tivoli's a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.150 
PM is very comparable the Tivoli's a
little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.469> bigger<00:02:08.239> but<00:02:09.379> they<00:02:10.379> they<00:02:10.830> carry

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
little bit bigger but they they carry

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.040 
little bit bigger but they they carry
about<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.819> same<00:02:12.060> amount<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.450> things<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.930> if

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
about the same amount of things so if

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.940 
about the same amount of things so if
you<00:02:13.110> really<00:02:13.349> like<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you really like that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
you really like that
I<00:02:13.980> beg<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:14.940> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> find<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.900> they

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I beg you're going to find that they

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.869 
I beg you're going to find that they
would<00:02:16.530> probably<00:02:16.709> either<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.250> work<00:02:17.489> for<00:02:17.760> you

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
would probably either one work for you

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.360 
would probably either one work for you
and<00:02:18.150> then<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.080> course<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.560> totally<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.069> really

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
and then of course the totally is really

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.660 
and then of course the totally is really
popular<00:02:20.849> because<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.810> more<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.709> tote<00:02:22.980> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
popular because it's more of a tote so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.100 
popular because it's more of a tote so
it's<00:02:23.879> got<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.349> longer<00:02:25.349> shoulder<00:02:25.860> drop<00:02:26.190> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
it's got the longer shoulder drop and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.780 
it's got the longer shoulder drop and
then<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.590> little<00:02:28.860> bit<00:02:29.040> bigger<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.430> would

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
then it's a little bit bigger I would

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.759 
then it's a little bit bigger I would
say<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.180> inside<00:02:30.599> as<00:02:30.780> far<00:02:30.959> as<00:02:31.080> what<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.590> can

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
say on the inside as far as what you can

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.699 
say on the inside as far as what you can
carry<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.550> got<00:02:32.760> more<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.150> square<00:02:33.330> shape

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
carry it's got more of a square shape

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.290 
carry it's got more of a square shape
and<00:02:34.709> then<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.400> did<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.610> review<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.180> as

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
and then I just did a review on this as

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.089 
and then I just did a review on this as
far<00:02:36.480> as<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:36.720> laptops<00:02:37.170> fit<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.800> also<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
far as what laptops fit so it's also a

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.100 
far as what laptops fit so it's also a
great<00:02:38.220> work<00:02:38.489> bag<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.510> if<00:02:39.599> you're<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:39.870> back

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
great work bag so if you're going back

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.289 
great work bag so if you're going back
and<00:02:40.170> forth<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.610> mom<00:02:42.030> that

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
and forth you know you're a mom that

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.110 
and forth you know you're a mom that
works<00:02:42.569> during<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> day<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.129> then<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.940> with

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
works during the day and then is with

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.729 
works during the day and then is with
the<00:02:45.209> kids<00:02:45.420> at<00:02:45.569> night<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.959> on<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.110> weekends<00:02:46.500> I

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the kids at night and on the weekends I

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.350 
the kids at night and on the weekends I
think<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.310> would<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.519> great<00:02:47.700> bake<00:02:47.910> for

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
think that would be a great bake for

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.220 
think that would be a great bake for
dual<00:02:48.630> purpose<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.349> well<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.819> then<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> course

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
dual purpose as well and then of course

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.259 
dual purpose as well and then of course
I'm<00:02:52.230> using<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.829> Toffoli<00:02:53.190> right<00:02:53.459> now<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:54.180> I'm
