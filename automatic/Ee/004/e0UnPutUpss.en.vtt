00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
a little Kumi wheel so this is the tool

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.680 
a little Kumi wheel so this is the tool
that<00:00:57.420> makes<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.020> really<00:00:58.379> really<00:00:58.890> easy<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> I've

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
already cut a few pieces of thread see

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.640 
already cut a few pieces of thread see
they're<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.180> assorted<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.490> tie

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
they're just assorted I'm going to tie
just<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.830> overhand<00:01:11.640> knot<00:01:12.470> just<00:01:13.470> pull<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.220> end

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
just an overhand knot just pull that end

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
just an overhand knot just pull that end
through<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> loop<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> slip

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
through the loop and I'm going to slip

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.149 
through the loop and I'm going to slip
that<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.450> through<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> center<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that down through the center of the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.210 
that down through the center of the
wheel<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.850> now<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> set<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.040> my

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
wheel and now I'm going to set up my

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.320 
wheel and now I'm going to set up my
threads<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> wheel<00:01:26.189> has<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.880> numbers

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
threads so the wheel has little numbers

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.810 
threads so the wheel has little numbers
on<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.490> set<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:29.880> threads<00:01:30.479> up

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
on it so you can set your threads up

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.300 
on it so you can set your threads up
according<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.210> numbers<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.070> see

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
according to these numbers you can see

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.830 
according to these numbers you can see
that<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.090> are<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.450> dots<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
that here there are little dots and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.560 
that here there are little dots and
that's<00:01:39.840> where<00:01:40.229> I'm<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.369> start<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.329> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
eight threads now I've chosen to use

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.080 
eight threads now I've chosen to use
just<00:01:45.659> two<00:01:45.899> colors<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.369> use<00:01:47.759> eight

different ones if you want to so the
secret<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.750> braiding<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.030> going

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
secret is the braiding so what I'm going

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.350 
secret is the braiding so what I'm going
to<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.040> take<00:01:56.310> let<00:01:57.000> me<00:01:57.119> turn<00:01:57.299> it

this way okay okay now I'm going to show
you<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.110> basic<00:02:01.500> weaving<00:02:02.100> technique<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you the basic weaving technique so I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.499 
you the basic weaving technique so I
take<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.700> thread<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:08.310> move<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
take this thread and I move it to the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.050 
take this thread and I move it to the
same<00:02:09.780> side<00:02:10.170> now<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:11.610> take<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.360> thread

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
same side now I take this thread

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.380 
same side now I take this thread
and<00:02:13.860> move<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.360> same<00:02:16.780> side<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:18.390> I'm

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
and move it to the same side now I'm

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.699 
and move it to the same side now I'm
going<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.930> turn<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.530> the

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
going to turn this and so it is the

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.240 
going to turn this and so it is the
other<00:02:23.890> direction<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:26.380> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.010> take
