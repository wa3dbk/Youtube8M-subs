I<00:05:32.669> was<00:05:32.880> kind<00:05:33.120> of<00:05:33.180> thinking<00:05:33.330> it<00:05:33.599> myself<00:05:33.810> when

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
I was kind of thinking it myself when

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.740 
I was kind of thinking it myself when
Saba<00:05:35.160> was<00:05:35.430> thinking<00:05:35.820> about<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.210> free<00:05:36.419> Hawks

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.260 
Saba was thinking about the free Hawks
and<00:05:37.110> Nero<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.950> how<00:05:38.130> they<00:05:38.370> haven't<00:05:38.729> come<00:05:38.940> and

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
and Nero and how they haven't come and

and Nero and how they haven't come and
saved<00:05:39.630> them<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.169> then<00:05:40.320> I<00:05:40.349> thought<00:05:40.770> what<00:05:41.190> if

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
saved them and then I thought what if

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.850 
saved them and then I thought what if
MAV<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:42.030> Lou<00:05:42.510> become<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:42.990> thing<00:05:43.289> I<00:05:43.530> don't<00:05:43.650> know
