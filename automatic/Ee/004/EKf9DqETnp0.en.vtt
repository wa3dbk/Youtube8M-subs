hello my name is Daniel kami creator of
the<00:00:03.990> cpt<00:00:04.640> 1019<00:00:06.290> today<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.529> like<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.890> talk<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> you

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the cpt 1019 today I like to talk to you

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.720 
the cpt 1019 today I like to talk to you
about<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.420> joystick<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.830> makes<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.219> cpt

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
about the joystick that makes the cpt

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.110 
about the joystick that makes the cpt
219<00:00:12.599> operate<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.710> took<00:00:13.889> me<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> long<00:00:14.309> time<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
219 operate it took me a long time to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.640 
219 operate it took me a long time to
produce<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.350> joystick<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:18.330> makes<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.840> cpt

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
produce this joystick that makes the cpt

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.050 
produce this joystick that makes the cpt
219<00:00:20.160> operate<00:00:20.730> inside<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.080> box<00:00:22.550> okay<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.970> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
219 operate inside the box okay do you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.250 
219 operate inside the box okay do you
have<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:25.910> circuit<00:00:26.910> board<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
have a circuit board that it you have to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
have a circuit board that it you have to
have<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.220> circuit<00:00:29.580> board<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.880> connected

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have and the circuit board is connected

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.799 
have and the circuit board is connected
to<00:00:30.539> speed<00:00:31.260> controllers<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.520> any<00:00:32.759> 12<00:00:33.510> volt

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to speed controllers with any 12 volt

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
to speed controllers with any 12 volt
motor<00:00:34.010> now<00:00:35.010> now<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.700> about<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
motor now now think about this for a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.479 
motor now now think about this for a
second<00:00:36.570> basically<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.160> little

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
second basically with this little

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.240 
second basically with this little
contraption<00:00:39.590> servos<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.980> connected

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
contraption servos can be connected

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
contraption servos can be connected
directly<00:00:42.140> into<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> circuit<00:00:43.649> board<00:00:44.420> which

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
directly into the circuit board which

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
directly into the circuit board which
will<00:00:45.660> fully<00:00:46.020> control<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.700> joystick

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
will fully control with this joystick

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.720 
will fully control with this joystick
right<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:51.719> serve<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> movement<00:00:52.590> okay<00:00:53.520> what

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
right here to serve a movement okay what

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.349 
right here to serve a movement okay what
i<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.030> done<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.270> modified<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.750> actual<00:00:58.230> box

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
i have done is modified the actual box

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
i have done is modified the actual box
okay<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.070> power<00:01:02.070> supply<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:05.010> have

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
okay you have a power supply you have

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.200 
okay you have a power supply you have
two<00:01:05.869> RCA<00:01:06.979> connectors<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.760> basically

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
two RCA connectors which basically

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.500 
two RCA connectors which basically
simply<00:01:09.810> plug<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:11.000> into<00:01:12.000> each<00:01:12.180> thing

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
simply plug in like this into each thing

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.710 
simply plug in like this into each thing
you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.619> move<00:01:13.799> almost<00:01:14.100> anything<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.630> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you can move almost anything with this

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
you can move almost anything with this
box<00:01:16.130> like<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> seer<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.610> lighter<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.970> you're<00:01:18.090> out

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
box like a seer it lighter if you're out

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
box like a seer it lighter if you're out
in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> field<00:01:18.420> doing<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.049> field<00:01:19.259> shot<00:01:19.670> 12<00:01:20.670> volt

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
in the field doing a field shot 12 volt

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
in the field doing a field shot 12 volt
battery<00:01:21.180> lasts<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.900> hours<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.500> hours<00:01:22.619> of
