00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
actually watch the fish suck the whole
doll<00:01:50.610> darn<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.799> set<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> hook<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
doll darn thing in I set the hook and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.280 
doll darn thing in I set the hook and
they<00:01:54.630> somehow<00:01:54.990> still<00:01:55.759> spit<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> hook<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.290> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
they somehow still spit the hook out and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.690 
they somehow still spit the hook out and
then<00:01:58.439> I've<00:01:58.530> seen<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.189> at<00:01:59.310> times<00:01:59.460> are

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
then I've seen that if at times are

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.010 
then I've seen that if at times are
waiting<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.210> completely<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.659> five

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
waiting like completely like five

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.280 
waiting like completely like five
seconds<00:02:01.469> straight<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:03.049> letting<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.079> fish

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
seconds straight of letting the fish

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.289 
seconds straight of letting the fish
take<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> bait<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.549> set<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> hook<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
take this bait in and I set the hook and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.730 
take this bait in and I set the hook and
there's<00:02:06.570> still<00:02:06.810> loot<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.350> still<00:02:07.590> losing

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
there's still loot and I'm still losing

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.050 
there's still loot and I'm still losing
them<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> don't<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> deal<00:02:09.030> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
them so I don't know what the deal is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.869 
them so I don't know what the deal is
there<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:11.039> best<00:02:11.220> thing<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.550> come<00:02:11.819> up

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
there but the best thing I can come up

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.700 
there but the best thing I can come up
with<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.540> widen

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
with this to widen

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.050 
with this to widen
is<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.370> stretch<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:16.020> weed<00:02:16.350> guard<00:02:17.060> so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
is to stretch out that weed guard so

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.850 
is to stretch out that weed guard so
more<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> hook<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.720> exposed<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.740> then

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
more of the hook is exposed but then

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.340 
more of the hook is exposed but then
again<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.100> still<00:02:20.400> get<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.110> extra<00:02:22.110> weed

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
again you still get that extra weed

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.780 
again you still get that extra weed
guard<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.040> got<00:02:23.190> more<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.640> hook

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
guard there you got more of the hook

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.240 
guard there you got more of the hook
exposed<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.810> make<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.830> we'd<00:02:26.070> go

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
exposed and as you make that we'd go

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.580 
exposed and as you make that we'd go
wider<00:02:26.550> you're<00:02:27.510> opening<00:02:27.870> up<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.140> hook<00:02:28.320> more

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
wider you're opening up the hook more

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.640 
wider you're opening up the hook more
for<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.920> fish<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.490> hook<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.850> there

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
for the fish to get that hook in there

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
for the fish to get that hook in there
so<00:02:31.650> I'm<00:02:31.950> gonna<00:02:32.160> take<00:02:32.400> our<00:02:32.670> cast<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.210> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
so I'm gonna take our cast here and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.270
