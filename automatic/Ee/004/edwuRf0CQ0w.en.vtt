and 2222 asked if I would do a video at
higher<00:00:14.130> speeds<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.210> interstate<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:19.279> here

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
higher speeds on the interstate so here

you<00:00:20.430> go<00:00:20.670> viewer

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.290 

in<00:00:26.210> most<00:00:26.509> people

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.190 

are<00:00:29.920> intimidated<00:00:30.920> by<00:00:31.689> riding<00:00:32.689> at<00:00:32.960> higher

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
are intimidated by riding at higher

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.209 
are intimidated by riding at higher
speeds

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
speeds

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
speeds
and<00:00:35.640> honestly<00:00:36.059> even<00:00:36.530> though<00:00:37.530> I've<00:00:37.710> been

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and honestly even though I've been

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.380 
and honestly even though I've been
writing<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.789> few<00:00:39.300> years<00:00:39.570> now

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
writing for a few years now

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.260 
writing for a few years now
it's<00:00:41.930> it's<00:00:42.350> steel<00:00:42.740> can<00:00:43.130> be<00:00:43.400> a<00:00:43.700> little<00:00:44.060> weird

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's it's steel can be a little weird

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.160 
it's it's steel can be a little weird
sometimes

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.610 

like<00:00:47.649> you<00:00:48.220> know

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.580 

I<00:00:50.649> mean<00:00:50.800> we're<00:00:51.190> going<00:00:51.520> you<00:00:52.000> know<00:00:52.059> 60<00:00:52.930> 70<00:00:52.960> miles

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
I mean we're going you know 60 70 miles

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.479 
I mean we're going you know 60 70 miles
per<00:00:53.739> hour

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
per hour

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.209 
per hour
and

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.849 

the<00:00:58.850> wind<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.390> much<00:00:59.600> more<00:00:59.870> intense<00:01:00.320> at<00:01:00.649> higher

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
the wind is much more intense at higher

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.390 
the wind is much more intense at higher
speeds<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:02.449> know<00:01:02.539> if<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:03.559> truck

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
speeds you know if a truck

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.899 
speeds you know if a truck
an<00:01:04.759> 18-wheeler<00:01:05.330> passes<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.860> feels<00:01:07.729> like

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
an 18-wheeler passes you it feels like

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.200 
an 18-wheeler passes you it feels like
you're<00:01:08.030> gonna<00:01:08.119> blow<00:01:08.540> off<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.960> road<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.940> you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
you're gonna blow off the road and you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.310 
you're gonna blow off the road and you
know<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.680> back<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:12.890> your<00:01:13.130> mind<00:01:13.400> no<00:01:14.320> matter

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
know in the back of your mind no matter

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.830 
know in the back of your mind no matter
how<00:01:15.560> far<00:01:16.009> distance<00:01:16.490> you're<00:01:16.640> going<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:17.720> if

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
how far distance you're going that if

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.700 
how far distance you're going that if
you<00:01:18.020> get<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:18.290> blowout<00:01:18.590> at<00:01:19.549> their<00:01:19.790> speed

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
you get a blowout at their speed

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.680 
you get a blowout at their speed
there's<00:01:22.220> really<00:01:22.460> not<00:01:22.700> much<00:01:22.940> hope<00:01:23.150> for<00:01:23.180> kicking

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
there's really not much hope for kicking

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.300 
there's really not much hope for kicking
it's<00:01:24.260> like<00:01:24.580> you're<00:01:25.580> pretty<00:01:25.910> much<00:01:26.060> screwed

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.780 

but<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.509> being<00:01:30.720> said

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.260 

I<00:01:33.850> think<00:01:34.600> statistically

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I think statistically

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.649 
I think statistically
you're<00:01:36.750> much<00:01:37.110> safer<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:38.070> much<00:01:38.880> less<00:01:39.270> likely

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
you're much safer and much less likely

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.760 
you're much safer and much less likely
to<00:01:39.899> have<00:01:40.200> an<00:01:40.350> accident<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.670> interstate

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
to have an accident on the interstate

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.170 
to have an accident on the interstate
when<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.580> little<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:46.110> know

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
when you are on a little you know

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.840 
when you are on a little you know
throwing<00:01:48.180> speed<00:01:50.450> road<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.899> near<00:01:52.560> your<00:01:52.710> house

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
throwing speed road like near your house

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.120 
throwing speed road like near your house
and<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.480> reason<00:01:55.900> is<00:01:56.050> most<00:01:56.440> accidents

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
and the reason is most accidents

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.859 
and the reason is most accidents
actually<00:01:57.490> happened

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
actually happened

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.249 
actually happened
at<00:02:00.380> slower<00:02:00.710> speeds<00:02:00.890> with<00:02:01.820> people<00:02:02.299> pulling<00:02:02.899> out

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
at slower speeds with people pulling out

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.550 
at slower speeds with people pulling out
in<00:02:03.409> front<00:02:03.469> of<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.890> not<00:02:04.880> seeing<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.320> off

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
in front of you not seeing you and off

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.999 
in front of you not seeing you and off
and<00:02:06.890> obviously<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.700> interstate<00:02:09.009> it's

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
and obviously on the interstate it's

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.380 
and obviously on the interstate it's
harder<00:02:10.340> for<00:02:10.369> summer<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.789> pull<00:02:10.940> out<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.209> front

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
harder for summer to pull out in front

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.360 
harder for summer to pull out in front
of<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.599> now<00:02:11.810> people<00:02:12.349> can<00:02:12.680> merge<00:02:12.950> into<00:02:13.220> your

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
of you now people can merge into your

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.259 
of you now people can merge into your
lane<00:02:13.840> which<00:02:14.840> I'm<00:02:15.050> sure<00:02:15.230> happens<00:02:15.620> all<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.800> time

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
lane which I'm sure happens all the time

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.900 
lane which I'm sure happens all the time
and<00:02:17.269> actually<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:18.230> couple<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.769> times<00:02:19.010> people

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910

and actually a couple of times people
have<00:02:20.030> started<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.599> merge<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.959> my<00:02:21.080> lane<00:02:21.319> and

quite as protected as I could be and she

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.500 
quite as protected as I could be and she
said<00:04:11.920> she<00:04:12.190> was<00:04:12.370> perfectly<00:04:12.940> fine<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.450> know

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
said she was perfectly fine you know

said she was perfectly fine you know
going<00:04:13.690> for<00:04:13.989> me<00:04:14.050> about<00:04:14.230> 80<00:04:14.410> miles<00:04:14.650> per<00:04:14.860> hour

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
going for me about 80 miles per hour

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.160 
going for me about 80 miles per hour
and<00:04:17.200> she<00:04:17.320> hit<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.010> ground<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.930> she<00:04:19.930> didn't

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.170 
and she hit the ground and she didn't
even<00:04:20.230> have<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> scratch<00:04:20.830> so

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.360 

so<00:04:24.540> that's<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.900> I'm<00:04:25.470> off<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> interstate<00:04:26.040> now

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
so that's it I'm off the interstate now

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.220 
so that's it I'm off the interstate now
and<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.940> actually<00:04:27.419> the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
and this is actually the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.510 
and this is actually the
the<00:04:29.410> off-ramp<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:30.930> talked<00:04:31.930> about<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:33.220> the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
the off-ramp that I talked about in the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.080 
the off-ramp that I talked about in the
video<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:33.880> said<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.840> merged<00:04:35.580> into<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.820> lane

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
video I said that I merged into a lane

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.720 
video I said that I merged into a lane
with<00:04:37.300> another<00:04:37.600> car

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
with another car

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.040 
with another car
so<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.270> thought<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.750> hope<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.230> helps

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
so I thought I hope that helps

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.129 
so I thought I hope that helps
and<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.560> will<00:04:43.770> see<00:04:43.979> you<00:04:44.099> later
