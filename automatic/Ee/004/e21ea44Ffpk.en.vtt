00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.570
 nothing under the battery 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.510
 well and not to be unfounded let's 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.390
 let's do a little experiment i take 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.700
 two phones one layer already obtainable he 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.300
