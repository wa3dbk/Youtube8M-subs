00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
okay so anyway this is the spot where

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.480 
okay so anyway this is the spot where
the<00:00:10.290> pyramids<00:00:10.740> gonna<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.870> my<00:00:13.009> my<00:00:14.009> compass

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the pyramids gonna be and my my compass

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.090 
the pyramids gonna be and my my compass
the<00:00:14.910> glue<00:00:15.120> dried<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:15.630> compass<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.529> on

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the glue dried on my compass so it's on

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.090 
the glue dried on my compass so it's on
there<00:00:17.430> pretty<00:00:17.640> good<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.100> 20-foot

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
there pretty good I have a 20-foot

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.120 
there pretty good I have a 20-foot
ladder<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.439> longest

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
ladder because that is the longest

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.550 
ladder because that is the longest
straight<00:00:23.430> edge<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.000> own<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:25.260> rather<00:00:25.410> than

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
straight edge that I own and rather than

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.349 
straight edge that I own and rather than
tie<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> string<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> isn't<00:00:26.970> probably

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
tie a string I think this isn't probably

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.849 
tie a string I think this isn't probably
be<00:00:27.449> better<00:00:27.890> anyway<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.130> simulate<00:00:30.859> show

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
be better anyway if we simulate show

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.580 
be better anyway if we simulate show
that's<00:00:32.130> down<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:34.020> put<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
that's down there and we put this on the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.959 
that's down there and we put this on the
ladder<00:00:37.460> almost<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.450> almost<00:00:39.750> perfect

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
ladder almost it this is almost perfect

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.500 
ladder almost it this is almost perfect
I<00:00:43.460> have<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.879> gonna<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> pyramid<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
I have this is gonna be the pyramid so I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.850 
I have this is gonna be the pyramid so I
don't<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.809> anymore<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
okay well at least I have a point of

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.990 
okay well at least I have a point of
reference<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:28.159> know<00:01:28.189> where<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.640> should<00:01:28.969> start

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
reference to know where I should start

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.709 
reference to know where I should start
laying<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.569> tire<00:01:29.750> wall<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.909> here's<00:01:32.569> the

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
laying the tire wall and here's the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.289 
laying the tire wall and here's the
corner<00:01:33.140> it's<00:01:33.319> going<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.560> be<00:01:33.619> kind<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:34.299> hand

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
corner that's okay going to lay up a

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.410 
corner that's okay going to lay up a
tire<00:01:39.409> found<00:01:39.709> a<00:01:39.860> first<00:01:40.280> rains<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.969> then<00:01:41.090> attire

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
tire found a first rains and then attire

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.160 
tire found a first rains and then attire
foundation<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.380> then<00:01:42.950> make<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.700> blocks<00:01:44.170> put

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
foundation and then make the blocks put

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.169 
foundation and then make the blocks put
like<00:01:45.319> a<00:01:45.349> level<00:01:45.619> concrete<00:01:46.250> bed<00:01:46.459> on<00:01:46.759> top<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.119> the

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
like a level concrete bed on top of the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.660 
like a level concrete bed on top of the
