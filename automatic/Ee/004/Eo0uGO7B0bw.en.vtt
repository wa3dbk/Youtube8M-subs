00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
we're doing everything in a two-to-one

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.160 
we're doing everything in a two-to-one
scale<00:01:31.329> ratio<00:01:31.509> which<00:01:32.229> means<00:01:32.499> everything<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.399> in

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
scale ratio which means everything is in

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.929

we had this issue we tried making we

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.609 
we had this issue we tried making we
consider<00:01:43.149> making<00:01:43.329> everything<00:01:43.600> 11<00:01:44.079> scale

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
consider making everything 11 scale

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.200 
consider making everything 11 scale
because<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.340> know<00:01:45.429> it's<00:01:45.520> minecraft<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:45.999> big

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
because you know it's minecraft is big

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.169 
because you know it's minecraft is big
but<00:01:46.960> everything<00:01:47.530> in<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.679> game<00:01:47.859> is<00:01:48.069> one<00:01:48.939> block

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
but everything in the game is one block

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.169 
but everything in the game is one block
like<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.659> characters<00:01:50.079> are<00:01:50.350> one<00:01:50.530> blocked<00:01:50.770> all

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
like the characters are one blocked all

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.700 
like the characters are one blocked all
the<00:01:52.179> blocks<00:01:52.389> are<00:01:52.539> one<00:01:52.689> block<00:01:52.810> obviously<00:01:53.439> but

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
the blocks are one block obviously but

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.819 
the blocks are one block obviously but
minecraft<00:01:54.340> we're<00:01:54.759> two<00:01:54.999> blocks<00:01:55.030> tall<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.649> was

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
minecraft we're two blocks tall it was

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.219 
minecraft we're two blocks tall it was
scale<00:01:57.159> well<00:01:57.459> at<00:01:57.639> all<00:01:57.880> bases<00:01:58.569> yeah<00:01:58.749> everything

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229

is<00:01:59.319> waging<00:01:59.740> small<00:01:59.979> yeah<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:00.969> we<00:02:01.209> scaled<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.659> up

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
is waging small yeah so we scaled it up

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.489 
is waging small yeah so we scaled it up
to<00:02:01.869> 20<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:03.189> had<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.459> do<00:02:03.609> can<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.149> say<00:02:04.299> something

really were to make to make it so people

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.090 
really were to make to make it so people
could<00:02:33.300> actually<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.410> avatars<00:02:34.950> in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
could actually like like avatars in

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.700 
could actually like like avatars in
Minecraft<00:02:35.430> could<00:02:35.550> actually<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:36.000> inside<00:02:36.710> and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
Minecraft could actually get inside and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.200 
Minecraft could actually get inside and
I<00:02:37.800> feel<00:02:38.010> claustrophobic<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.730> we've<00:02:42.090> been

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
I feel claustrophobic so we've been

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.060 
I feel claustrophobic so we've been
working<00:02:42.270> with<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.810> everything<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.560> mean<00:02:43.860> it

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
working with that everything I mean it

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.620 
working with that everything I mean it
actually<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.820> makes<00:02:45.060> things<00:02:45.270> look<00:02:45.480> more

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
actually it makes things look more

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.180 
actually it makes things look more
realistic<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.260> mean<00:02:46.440> obviously<00:02:46.770> right<00:02:47.040> now

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
realistic I mean obviously right now

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.920 
realistic I mean obviously right now
everything<00:02:48.150> looks<00:02:48.330> pretty<00:02:48.480> good<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.780> my

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
everything looks pretty good in my

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.850 
everything looks pretty good in my
opinion<00:02:50.420> over<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:52.020> we<00:02:52.200> going<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.410> do<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
opinion over here are we going to do the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.990 
opinion over here are we going to do the
video<00:02:53.490> okay<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.290> there's<00:02:55.290> your<00:02:55.350> sign

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
video okay so there's your sign

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.170 
video okay so there's your sign
Professor<00:02:57.000> Oak's<00:02:57.210> lab<00:02:58.460> yeah<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:02.520> try<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.000> make

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
Professor Oak's lab yeah I try to make

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.380 
Professor Oak's lab yeah I try to make
it<00:03:03.240> as<00:03:03.420> accurate<00:03:03.750> as<00:03:03.870> possible<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:05.360> kind<00:03:06.360> of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
it as accurate as possible but kind of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.560 
it as accurate as possible but kind of
difficult<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:07.710> you<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:07.980> see<00:03:08.190> here<00:03:08.580> they<00:03:09.390> look

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
difficult as you can see here they look

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.480 
difficult as you can see here they look
like<00:03:09.600> books<00:03:10.140> but<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:10.560> actually<00:03:10.740> computer

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
like books but it's actually computer

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.600 
like books but it's actually computer
servers<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.660> don't<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.350> fooled<00:03:13.650> together

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
servers so don't be fooled together

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.870 
servers so don't be fooled together
these<00:03:15.390> are<00:03:15.570> computers<00:03:15.960> servers<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:17.490> pictures

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
these are computers servers the pictures

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.180 
these are computers servers the pictures
we<00:03:18.300> got<00:03:18.480> from<00:03:18.810> with<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.170> Pokecraft<00:03:19.590> texture

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
we got from with the Pokecraft texture

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.450 
we got from with the Pokecraft texture
pack<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:22.020> main<00:03:22.200> texture<00:03:22.710> pack<00:03:22.950> we're<00:03:23.160> using

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
pack the main texture pack we're using

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.250 
pack the main texture pack we're using
as<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> sort<00:03:24.150> X<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:26.120> UL<00:03:27.120> HUD<00:03:27.390> HUD<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:28.050> have

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
as the sort X and the UL HUD HUD we have

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.540 
as the sort X and the UL HUD HUD we have
the<00:03:28.650> GUI<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.100> from<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.540> fax<00:03:30.840> bdcraft<00:03:31.550> so

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
the GUI is from this fax bdcraft so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.850 
the GUI is from this fax bdcraft so
basically<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.270> agree<00:03:33.570> on<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.930> pack<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.770> we

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
basically we can agree on one pack so we

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.770 
basically we can agree on one pack so we
just<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.310> three<00:03:35.580> together<00:03:35.730> yeah<00:03:36.540> when

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
just like the three together yeah when

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.080 
just like the three together yeah when
we<00:03:37.020> made<00:03:37.200> one<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:41.090> there

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
we made one that we that we like there

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.040 
we made one that we that we like there
was<00:03:42.210> also<00:03:42.420> an<00:03:42.750> issue<00:03:42.900> with<00:03:44.300> with<00:03:45.300> like<00:03:45.750> depth

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
was also an issue with with like depth

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.800 
was also an issue with with like depth
and<00:03:46.290> height<00:03:46.710> if<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:48.030> notice<00:03:48.330> in<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.630> game

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and height if you notice in the game

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.480 
and height if you notice in the game
pretty<00:03:49.230> much<00:03:49.320> everything<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.830> virtually<00:03:50.190> flat

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
pretty much everything is virtually flat

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.380 
pretty much everything is virtually flat
so<00:03:51.480> what<00:03:52.020> we<00:03:52.140> had<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.380> do<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.860> we<00:03:53.370> were<00:03:53.820> we

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
so what we had to do is we were we

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.150 
so what we had to do is we were we
improvised<00:03:55.050> with<00:03:55.410> some<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.830> designs

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
improvised with some of the designs

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.210 
improvised with some of the designs
making<00:03:56.790> everything<00:03:57.030> look<00:03:57.530> less<00:03:58.530> dull<00:03:58.920> and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
making everything look less dull and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.610 
making everything look less dull and
unwrapped<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.870> game<00:04:01.080> where<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.410> trees

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
unwrapped in the game where the trees

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.440 
unwrapped in the game where the trees
wall<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:01.980> off<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.670> don't<00:04:02.850> actually<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.420> that

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
wall you off you don't actually do that

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.530 
wall you off you don't actually do that
because<00:04:03.780> they<00:04:03.930> don't<00:04:04.080> think<00:04:04.200> we<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.940> but<00:04:05.940> in

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
because they don't think we can but in

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.030 
because they don't think we can but in
like<00:04:06.750> we've<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.380> thing<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.590> there's<00:04:07.830> really

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
like we've the thing is there's really

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.830 
like we've the thing is there's really
nothing<00:04:08.430> behind<00:04:08.610> these<00:04:08.910> trees<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.690> you'll

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
nothing behind these trees like you'll

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.260 
nothing behind these trees like you'll
be<00:04:09.930> disappointed<00:04:10.580> there's<00:04:11.580> not<00:04:11.670> like<00:04:11.850> yeah<00:04:12.090> a

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
be disappointed there's not like yeah a

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.250 
be disappointed there's not like yeah a
black<00:04:12.630> jars<00:04:12.930> are<00:04:13.080> behind<00:04:13.290> there<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:15.260> we

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
black jars are behind there we we

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.710 
black jars are behind there we we
definitely<00:04:16.680> found<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.920> secluded<00:04:17.160> area<00:04:17.720> and

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
definitely found a secluded area and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.180 
definitely found a secluded area and
we're<00:04:18.840> hoping<00:04:19.170> we<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.350> fit<00:04:19.650> everything<00:04:19.890> in

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
we're hoping we can fit everything in

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.000 
we're hoping we can fit everything in
this<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.940> area<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.359> built<00:04:21.740> we<00:04:22.740> have

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
this this area that we built we have

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.390 
this this area that we built we have
route<00:04:23.490> one<00:04:23.730> down<00:04:24.240> there<00:04:24.390> completed<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.400> most

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
route one down there completed and most

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.830 
route one down there completed and most
of<00:04:26.610> Viridian<00:04:27.060> City<00:04:27.270> completed<00:04:29.570> everything<00:04:30.570> in

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
of Viridian City completed everything in

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.620 
of Viridian City completed everything in
Pallet<00:04:31.170> Town<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.590> pretty<00:04:31.920> basic<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:33.000> our<00:04:33.390> next

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
Pallet Town is pretty basic so our next

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.570 
Pallet Town is pretty basic so our next
the<00:04:34.020> next<00:04:34.140> videos<00:04:34.470> you're<00:04:34.560> going<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.740> see<00:04:34.950> it's

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
the next videos you're going to see it's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.469 
the next videos you're going to see it's
going<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.880> be<00:04:35.970> there<00:04:36.060> going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.210> be<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.330> lot<00:04:36.419> more

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
going to be there going to be a lot more

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.690 
going to be there going to be a lot more
extravagant<00:04:36.919> route<00:04:37.919> 1<00:04:38.100> maybe<00:04:38.370> not<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.640> much

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
extravagant route 1 maybe not so much

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.559 
extravagant route 1 maybe not so much
because<00:04:38.940> it's<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.390> a

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
because it's just a

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.459 
because it's just a
out<00:04:39.689> it<00:04:40.139> is<00:04:40.499> a<00:04:40.529> cool<00:04:40.860> route<00:04:41.099> because<00:04:42.139> its<00:04:43.139> large

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
out it is a cool route because its large

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:44.570 
out it is a cool route because its large
it<00:04:43.770> puts<00:04:43.949> you<00:04:44.039> in<00:04:44.099> a<00:04:44.159> first-person

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580

perspective<00:04:44.879> of<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.479> route<00:04:45.919> it's<00:04:46.919> realistic

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:47.249 
perspective of the route it's realistic

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.339 
perspective of the route it's realistic
we<00:04:48.209> exemplified<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.319> depth<00:04:49.559> thing<00:04:50.550> some<00:04:50.849> more

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
we exemplified the depth thing some more

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.959 
we exemplified the depth thing some more
so<00:04:52.349> you<00:04:52.770> actually<00:04:52.949> are<00:04:53.339> like<00:04:53.520> traveling

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
upwards and they're out and then brabant

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.749 
upwards and they're out and then brabant
