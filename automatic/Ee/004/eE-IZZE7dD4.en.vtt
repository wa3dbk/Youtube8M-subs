over<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.970> not<00:01:05.970> quite<00:01:06.240> sure<00:01:07.640> what<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.790> for

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
over there not quite sure what it's for

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.679

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.070 
maybe the dryer used to vent out that
way<00:01:13.900> but<00:01:14.759> then<00:01:15.759> what's<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.180> for<00:01:16.659> I<00:01:16.689> don't

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
way but then what's that for I don't

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.719 
way but then what's that for I don't
know<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.540> idea<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:21.009> going<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.280> cover
