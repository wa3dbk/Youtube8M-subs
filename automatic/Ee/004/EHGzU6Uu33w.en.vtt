00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
have they use enough glue on the backing

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.670 
have they use enough glue on the backing
or<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.360> just<00:02:54.420> gassing<00:02:55.140> off<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
