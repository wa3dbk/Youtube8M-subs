00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.930
 new video of auto ii.de drove us 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.000
 have a little whiz for today 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.099
 a little more behind your ears 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.970
 I should talk about that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:20.279
 opel corsa opc and where can you get one 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.369
 The sporty qualities of the vehicle 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.140
 should show the best test correctly 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 on the track and that's why we are 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.880
 go to Dudenhofen and are now 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 in the opel test center around the small times 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 to challenge a bit 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.820
 In short, in this video we will 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.829
 not to all the technical details 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.620
 say something because we already have one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.020
 video made to the normal opel corsa 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 we will sit down once it here 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.149
 and of course in the infobox 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.399
 but of course we tell 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.730
 you now what the opc so different 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.620
 can 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.899
 Design technically you can see the opel corsa 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.180
 opc only at the second glance 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.859
 that he is the sportier candidate 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 we have one here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.059
 substantial sportier lip and also 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 a few details with crooked ones for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.470
 look sporty and look good 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.909
 also suggest that there is a 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.280
 little else is behind it and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.510
 then what is behind it? 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 one at the back of the car 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.070
 because these two exhaust pipes leave 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 already suspect that there is a little more 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.299
 power in the small slumbers 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.100
 human and the car it is important that 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.509
 if you want to do sports 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.280
 you still have the matching shoes 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.490
 and we have them in this case 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.500
 In any case, for one thing , we have 18 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.409
 inch rims in contrast to the normal ones 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.930
 opel corsa so a two sizes more and 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.549
 I think there is really good for him 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.780
 We also have a lot here for others 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.970
 very nice rubber 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 because we have michelin supersport here 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.560
 mature and I'm looking forward to it now 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.170
 really design-technically one sees at 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.750
 opel corsa opc compared to normal 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.850
 Opel Corsa actually no differences 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.159
 but there is a big one 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.340
 difference in here namely the seats 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.290
 we have the recaro sports seats 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.420
 in the already such a slight shell 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.189
 have shape and, of course, for 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.719
 so sport here under the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.349
 hood is now the heart of the 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.060
 corsa opc a 1 6 liter turbocharged engine 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.750
 opposite the Dutch in the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:21.240
 edition may 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:22.710
 before optional the motorsport that is 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.490
 there must be something here right now 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.190
 go twists 245 meters short 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.360
 overboost 280 I may be curious how 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.980
 Keep that on the track for a long time 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 can officially because he can only for 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.820
 a minimal short enough moment of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.830
 the technical data and the mere 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.480
 bright theory now let's look at 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.930
 how much of the power he really has 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930
 on the street 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.440
 some hours and we have the corsa 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.330
 opc on the in-house test plant 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.070
 can test extensively 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.060
 the brakes are really exposed 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.700
 you have to be honest in the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.980
 performance pack if you have the 330 mm 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.140
 the big slices really just like that 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.940
 It really takes to fit in here 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.110
 Brilliant well the pack neat 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.280
 You do not think that when you're there 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.870
 just step on the brake 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.400
 because we also have a technical 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.800
 made which concerned the brakes to these 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.010
 to slow things down and there 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.540
 have misjudged us because so 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.010
 he achievements are expected in such a 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.020
 small car actually not compared 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.580
 with the nürburgring edition I find 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.070
 because the steering has succeeded a bit better 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.580
 at least in the last production 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.170
 model series 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.240
 because we have already heard of others 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.100
 that was not always so great and we 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.810
 find the newer a little better 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.460
 Personally, I have the guidance in the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.100
 nürburgring edition better because 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.930
 here also so minimal play in it 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.460
 was therefore white in itself corsa opc 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.620
 super car but I would definitely 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.530
 therefore the performance pack is recommended 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.820
 all inspired by motorsports 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.390
 features get to the car 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.960
 really good 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.780
 that 's it with the opel corsa opc we 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.790
 thank you for watching and would 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.100
 We are happy if you give us a thumbs up 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.050
 goes up and if you do not already 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.240
 has long been synonymous still an abo 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.660
 dallas otherwise I say until the 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.660
 next time
