00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
your electronic stabilizing programs

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.560 
your electronic stabilizing programs
and<00:02:13.920> all<00:02:13.980> speed<00:02:14.250> traps<00:02:14.520> control<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> very

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
and all speed traps control it's a very

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.880 
and all speed traps control it's a very
nice<00:02:15.750> safety<00:02:16.020> feature<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.590> got<00:02:16.710> built

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
nice safety feature that we got built

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.830 
nice safety feature that we got built
into<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.190> vehicle<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.820> when<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.330> right<00:02:18.540> bit

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
into this vehicle so when the right bit

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.630 
into this vehicle so when the right bit
right<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.350> right<00:02:19.560> tire<00:02:19.830> starts<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.370> spin

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
right and the right tire starts to spin

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.010 
right and the right tire starts to spin
it's<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.330> send<00:02:21.510> break<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.930> right

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
it's going to send break to the right

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's going to send break to the right
tire<00:02:22.320> traction<00:02:22.920> over<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.310> left<00:02:23.490> tire<00:02:23.700> when

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
tire traction over the left tire when

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.460 
tire traction over the left tire when
that<00:02:24.270> one<00:02:24.420> starts<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.720> spin<00:02:24.960> it's<00:02:25.110> gonna<00:02:25.230> send

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that one starts to spin it's gonna send

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.320 
that one starts to spin it's gonna send
brake<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.920> tire<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.460> traction<00:02:26.910> back<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
brake to that tire and traction back to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.700 
brake to that tire and traction back to
the<00:02:27.420> other<00:02:27.540> tire<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.260> always<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.680> a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the other tire so you always have a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.560 
the other tire so you always have a
gripping<00:02:28.980> tire<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.610> road<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.090> keep<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
gripping tire on the road and keep it

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.090 
gripping tire on the road and keep it
going<00:02:30.750> nice<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.110> straight<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.980> also

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
going nice and straight you can also

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.770 
going nice and straight you can also
lock<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.580> doors<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.000> windows<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.300> nobody<00:02:33.690> can

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
lock the doors and windows so nobody can

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.560 
lock the doors and windows so nobody can
play<00:02:33.960> with<00:02:34.110> them<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.350> like<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.370> say<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.760> here

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
play with them and like I say the here

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.880 
play with them and like I say the here
is<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> shifter<00:02:37.140> now<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.350> talked<00:02:37.560> about<00:02:37.650> this

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
is the shifter now we talked about this

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.010 
is the shifter now we talked about this
being<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.310> man<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.700> automat<00:02:39.360> an<00:02:39.540> annual

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
being a man you automat an annual

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.690 
being a man you automat an annual
transmission<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.130> basically<00:02:41.430> there's<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
transmission so basically there's a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.190 
transmission so basically there's a
shifter<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.360> basically<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.960> move<00:02:43.110> it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
shifter so basically as you move it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.830 
shifter so basically as you move it
around<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.160> normal<00:02:44.640> or<00:02:45.030> sort<00:02:45.780> of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
around it's just normal or sort of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.110 
around it's just normal or sort of
neutral<00:02:46.200> reverse<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.130> drive<00:02:47.550> there's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
neutral reverse and drive there's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.670 
neutral reverse and drive there's
actually<00:02:48.540> no<00:02:48.660> Park

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
actually no Park

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.740 
actually no Park
so<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.910> field<00:02:51.180> class<00:02:51.300> you're<00:02:51.480> driving

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
so with this field class you're driving

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.570 
so with this field class you're driving
down<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.990> road<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.350> will<00:02:52.800> feel<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.190> vehicle

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
down the road you will feel the vehicle

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.430 
down the road you will feel the vehicle
manually<00:02:54.120> I'm<00:02:54.750> sorry<00:02:54.990> you'll<00:02:55.140> feel<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
manually I'm sorry you'll feel the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.870 
manually I'm sorry you'll feel the
minute<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.950> vehicle<00:02:56.280> automatically

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
minute the vehicle automatically

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
minute the vehicle automatically
manually<00:02:57.450> switching<00:02:57.900> gears<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.410> there's<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
manually switching gears so there's a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.350 
manually switching gears so there's a
