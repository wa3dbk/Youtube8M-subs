this<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> sleeper<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.190> tend<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
this I know a sleeper you know I tend to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.930 
this I know a sleeper you know I tend to
use<00:00:53.670> something<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.150> that<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.910> Eragon<00:00:56.910> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.040 
use something like that it's a Eragon I
think<00:00:57.210> by<00:00:57.329> mask

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
think by mask

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.069 
think by mask
I'm<00:00:59.010> super<00:00:59.399> shallow<00:00:59.550> diving<00:01:00.390> off<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.930> it's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
I'm super shallow diving off so it's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.890 
I'm super shallow diving off so it's
just<00:01:01.230> slightly<00:01:01.440> below<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.190> surface<00:01:02.900> reason

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
just slightly below the surface reason

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.530 
just slightly below the surface reason
being<00:01:04.050> is<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.940> know<00:01:06.090> there's<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> lot

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
being is because you know there's a lot

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.630 
being is because you know there's a lot
of<00:01:06.630> rocks<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.190> try<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> avoid<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
of rocks you want to try to avoid that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
of rocks you want to try to avoid that
but<00:01:09.090> yet<00:01:09.509> again<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.960> Fisher's<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.440> always

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
but yet again the Fisher's are always

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.680 
but yet again the Fisher's are always
hiding<00:01:10.800> in<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.369> there's<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.000> long<00:01:12.180> weeks<00:01:12.450> as

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
have no no firewall so this is a newly

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.480 
have no no firewall so this is a newly
given<00:01:46.050> is<00:01:46.170> being<00:01:46.440> open<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> try

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
given is being open so do a try

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.910 
given is being open so do a try
where<00:01:51.000> appropriate<00:01:51.270> Footwear<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.770> don't

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
where appropriate Footwear you don't

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.460 
where appropriate Footwear you don't
like<00:01:53.070> give<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.640> stuff<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:57.350> used<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
like give some stuff like there used to

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.620 
like give some stuff like there used to
be<00:01:58.530> good<00:01:58.799> back<00:01:59.009> then<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.329> still

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
be good back then but and this is still

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.190 
be good back then but and this is still
producing<00:02:01.490> official<00:02:02.490> too

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
producing official too

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
producing official too
so<00:02:04.200> alternatively<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.220> can<00:02:05.340> also<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> spin

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
so alternatively you can also do a spin

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.780 
so alternatively you can also do a spin
fly<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
fly which I don't really like but as I

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.350 
fly which I don't really like but as I
envisioned<00:02:09.329> in<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:09.660> video<00:02:09.899> preferences

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360

we go in it fish on oh great under t
