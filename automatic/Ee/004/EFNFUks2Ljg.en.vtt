00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello kids has commented united traigo 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.429
 the departure of nuclear in overflow with the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.630
 p of w and then also only 7 and not 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.540
 I know what other weapon I think the ch 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.610
 I do not know how you'll see it, and well 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 I saw the video yesterday you said a lot 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.840
 that is the nuclear i was before likes like that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.359
 I like this way of playing and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.789
 abide a little the mentality that was 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.859
 playing a little bit because before as you know 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.019
 the videos you have seen was going super to sack 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.369
 and to get a streak of 30 with weapon was 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.189
 quite complicated because I would be 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.170
 kill in 15 or 20 because you have me with 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 enemy and we're not going it gives me a little bit 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.910
 if he died it was not the big goal let's say 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.370
 how he played was to get the maximum 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 possible points and this is simply 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.780
 play until then to get more 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 nuclear I put this morning 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 in the fourth or third game I think 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.239
 it came out this game that pretty good 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 so nothing very happy and good what 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.469
 I left the nuclear mentality a bit 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.559
 to get you out and what gusts and how 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.270
 new by the workflow map 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.609
 forward more played better and you understand 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.610
 Well, what do I mean mentally? 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.080
 then in this case for example if you 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.730
 like when normal yes 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.100
 the nuclear chamber would have entered 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.630
 directly makes like a madman could 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.830
 kill a few and he would have killed me and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.490
 vice repeaters and another game 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.530
 taking me out because with gusts of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.240
 assault by backroom 90 casualties a couple of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 deaths but obviously without nuclear 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.200
 where I do it in this case is to stay 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.790
 in an area to control it for example 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 the spa where he dined I get to not 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.030
 change the spots my friends the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.470
 companions who were playing 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.270
 with me they are not the plan or anything 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.950
 the luck is that they do not get so little 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.320
 them so we have a little control 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.030
 of spam dc have to come contact 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.230
 mind on this side in the middle for the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.080
 left to advance the flags 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.120
 this give me a position of control 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.940
 of total control of the clashes 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.930
 because I have on top of embezzling and the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.130
 ub and he and the answer egg then 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.500
 I know exactly where the enemy is and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.290
 where to put myself for again do not go 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.790
 in them and kill themselves then that 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.800
 it's simply that change of 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.540
 mentality and that change of gusts help 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.980
 very much and the truth that almost took me out 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.070
 a nuclear double in this game 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.950
 Rodrigo will win the 33 in the first the 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.110
 first round and then the second one pulls me out 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.090
 a run of 23 and die more than anything 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.570
 because there is very little time left 10 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.190
 domain points and I still had a 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.930
 pair of casualties I think eight new and that 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.940
 I put in a bag that what you do not have to 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.680
 do not know when to nuclear and I 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.390
 they obviously sent a couple but 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.070
 the government not behind just does 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.770
 exteriors for one and that killed 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.140
 then is that the mentality is 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.620
 it's just to use bone 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.150
 a response website and then you can use 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.210
 an assault rifle submachine gun does not matter 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.380
 if you know you use the weapon you prefer and 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.360
 silence is if it is not helping 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.620
 it also comes well we hope what 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.360
 main or gusts 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.129
 play a more defensive mentality a 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.250
 jacket that is very different a jacket 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.610
 but to run except to control the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.230
 where enemy comes how to control the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.640
 confrontation so that you have a 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.110
 place to cover you or a box or a 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.000
 window whatever to be able to cover 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.860
 then it is the only way to rule 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.260
 the art loop to see if you create good luck 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.209
 and strong for really bad people 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.450
 that you can express with your unique sword 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.459
 less space than that but I think I believe and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.670
 I'll do in this were the series 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.140
 is more than anything with a little more to the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.450
 defensive find a little 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.160
 confrontation and use it to a game of 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.049
 response and websites apart from weapons 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.290
 nuclear here you see me almost do not kill 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.959
 but it is strong or from the slabs to dense 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.440
 now yes alone these in fact I do not know 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.470
 with the person shock charges 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.720
 but good then 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.870
 as you see is nuclear in over flow not 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.250
 is with a weapon so I'm going to do first 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.950
 than doing the maps because it's coming 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.840
 better to get used to let's say to the map 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.520
 as a nuclear channel on the map the best 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.800
 way to do it and also because you can 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.630
 use then the weapons or their possible 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.550
 protected solution I will not have to go 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.260
 changing and using so creators of that 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.720
 and insurance and then when I got used and 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.910
 with these weapons, I will use the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.340
 faces like weapons and all that roll 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.840
 but we go but I do not promise you either 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.850
 make me with all the weapons and in all 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.080
 the maps but I will try and if not 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.269
 you want to get the best games 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.820
 possible to be entertained and that 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.990
 you like as much as you can obviously 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.910
 then in this case despite the fact that 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.740
 nuclear a 30 and 30 in the first round 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.240
 just so I'm going to try to make that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.820
 be just one round of energy the most 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.100
 possible fast and I almost got the second one 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.500
 I said before making a run 23 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.780
 but not included because it would be 120 10 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.460
 minutes and neither that nuclear the second 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.440
 so well there's how I'm going to be 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.180
 nuclear the medal is to those who do not 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.100
 you know the nuclear is a train run and 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.630
 is with weapons only in this game is not 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.900
 a streak is not a streak of casualties 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.900
 kill anyone 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.630
 and well these kids are with the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.080
 gameplay I hope you liked and 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.310
 tell me to give the line 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.350
 it's fine if you really want to be 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.050
 this series you want with weapons like 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.050
 you want it this is until later
