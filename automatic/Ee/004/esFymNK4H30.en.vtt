videos had some crap on it I tried to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:27.980 
videos had some crap on it I tried to
tell<00:00:27.029> me<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.480> kinds<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.750> stuff<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
tell me to do all kinds of stuff that

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.439 
tell me to do all kinds of stuff that
didn't<00:00:28.439> work<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.400> combined<00:00:29.789> their<00:00:30.000> theories

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
didn't work so I combined their theories

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.420 
didn't work so I combined their theories
and<00:00:30.890> I<00:00:31.890> made<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:34.260> best<00:00:34.440> solution<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and I made the best solution to do it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.270 
and I made the best solution to do it
and<00:00:35.730> uh<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:37.140> work<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.590> hundred<00:00:37.800> percent<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and uh it will work a hundred percent of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680 
and uh it will work a hundred percent of
the<00:00:38.370> time<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.760> know<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.000> hear<00:00:39.180> people<00:00:39.300> say<00:00:39.570> that
