00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello then today I'm going to you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.580
 learn to change the hull to real 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.309
 of your iphone so to do this it's 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 very simple just take a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.820
 special tool that you can buy 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 on the internet or in some stores 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.150
 you're going to davis and the two little screws 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.769
 that you can see one and two 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.990
 so you go summer life is once 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.439
 the davis currencies and you take your 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.439
 iphone 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.450
 so we can see that both vices 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.180
 are removed you will push the hull 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.489
 backwards like this until 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 what it gets a little bit here in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.960
 underneath as you can see you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 push forward as far as 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 you will remove the shell by pulling 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.899
 so above 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.809
 she reformed at small roeulx mauritius and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.290
 that you can see in black hoist and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:13.200
 so you're going to lift it off you take it off 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.420
 the hull you can see all the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.119
 iphone system you take a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.299
 other hull so the one you have 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.140
 want to put instead you ask 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.799
 above until the nest 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 perfectly 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:36.770
 and then you push the coke back to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.770
 the back of the iphone so like this 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.830
 so here I pushed then you 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.550
 go put back the two little screws that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.310
 you removed 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.950
 just before you do not lose 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.960
 vices that because it is not part 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:08.420
 not easily so you put them back 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:14.739
 two small opposite and one is the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.739
 second like this 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.370
 and you aim 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.319
 you do not really know it's not used for 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.330
 great thing so here you show us 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.870

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.870
