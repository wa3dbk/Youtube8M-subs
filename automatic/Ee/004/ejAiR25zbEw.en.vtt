you can leave it sort of drive like it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.810 
you can leave it sort of drive like it
is<00:01:05.570> if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.869> moisten<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.920> holds<00:01:08.250> quite<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is if you moisten it it holds quite a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
bit of moisture to the product and it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
bit of moisture to the product and it
keeps<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.180> moist<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> while<00:01:13.530> but

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
keeps it moist for quite a while but

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
keeps it moist for quite a while but
it's<00:01:14.760> really<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.180> nice<00:01:15.479> substrate<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.200> work

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it's really a nice substrate to work

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.890 
it's really a nice substrate to work
with<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:18.570> sort<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.049> has<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.590> consistency<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
with it sort of has the consistency of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
with it sort of has the consistency of
soil<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.400> quite<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:25.820> difficult<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
soil but it's not quite as difficult to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.920 
soil but it's not quite as difficult to
work<00:01:27.390> with

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
work with

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.060 
work with
this<00:01:28.200> certainly<00:01:28.590> blends<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.430> much<00:01:30.210> easier

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
this certainly blends in much easier

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.789 
this certainly blends in much easier
then<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.610> soil<00:01:33.090> would<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.320> makes<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
then then soil would be but it makes a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.980 
then then soil would be but it makes a
great<00:01:34.829> borrowing<00:01:35.729> substrate<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.540> reptiles

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
great borrowing substrate for reptiles

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
great borrowing substrate for reptiles
that<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> borrow<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.579> very<00:01:39.060> easy<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that like to borrow it's very easy to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.679 
that like to borrow it's very easy to
clean<00:01:39.840> because<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.460> reptile<00:01:42.270> goes<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
clean because when your reptile goes to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.510 
clean because when your reptile goes to
the<00:01:42.780> bathroom<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.500> sort<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.979> clumps<00:01:44.369> up

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the bathroom it sort of just clumps up

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
the bathroom it sort of just clumps up
and<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> scooper<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:45.930> anything

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
and you can take a scooper or anything

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.069 
and you can take a scooper or anything
to<00:01:47.130> take<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.610> scooped<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.720> take<00:01:48.930> up

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
to take out that scooped out so take up

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.660 
to take out that scooped out so take up
the<00:01:49.200> part<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.619> clumped<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.340> throw<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the part that's clumped out and throw it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.030 
the part that's clumped out and throw it
out<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.020> need<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.799> just

replace a little but great substrate to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
replace a little but great substrate to
work<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:58.049> other<00:01:58.200> thing<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> talk

already<00:02:04.590> pre-made<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
already pre-made for you

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.660 
already pre-made for you
ready<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:06.050> go<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.620> this<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.190> eight<00:02:07.430> point

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
ready to go and this is eight point

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.290 
ready to go and this is eight point
eight<00:02:08.030> liters<00:02:09.400> this<00:02:10.400> is<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> little<00:02:10.970> bit<00:02:11.090> more

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
eight liters this is a little bit more

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.550 
eight liters this is a little bit more
expensive<00:02:11.600> because<00:02:11.870> there's<00:02:12.110> already

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
expensive because there's already

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.780 
expensive because there's already
pre-made<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:14.420> prefer<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.490> sell<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> three

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
pre-made if you prefer we sell a three

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.080 
pre-made if you prefer we sell a three
pack<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.600> three<00:02:18.230> brick<00:02:18.680> kind<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.550> what<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:19.880> call

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
pack a three brick kind of what we call

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.060 
pack a three brick kind of what we call
it<00:02:20.270> because<00:02:20.480> there's<00:02:20.660> actually<00:02:20.840> three<00:02:21.380> bricks

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
it because there's actually three bricks

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.070 
it because there's actually three bricks
of<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.490> compressed<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.630> what<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.960> would

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
of this compressed so what you would

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.800 
of this compressed so what you would
need<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.410> do<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.800> stuff<00:02:25.570> it's<00:02:26.570> less

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
need to do with this stuff it's less

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.740 
need to do with this stuff it's less
expensive<00:02:27.110> than<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.620> 8.8<00:02:28.460> liter<00:02:28.880> but<00:02:29.390> yet<00:02:29.630> it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
expensive than this 8.8 liter but yet it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.070 
expensive than this 8.8 liter but yet it
makes<00:02:29.990> 24<00:02:30.680> liters<00:02:31.580> from<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:32.000> free<00:02:32.210> brick<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
makes 24 liters from this free brick so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.810 
makes 24 liters from this free brick so
you<00:02:33.530> have<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.130> bit<00:02:34.340> more<00:02:34.370> labour

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
you have to do a little bit more labour

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.640 
you have to do a little bit more labour
with<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.450> make<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.690> work<00:02:35.870> which<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.410> wet

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
with this to make it work which is wet

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.090 
with this to make it work which is wet
it<00:02:36.800> down<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.400> then<00:02:37.970> sort<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.300> let<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.600> dry<00:02:39.100> and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
it down and then sort of let it dry and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.120 
it down and then sort of let it dry and
it<00:02:41.030> makes<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.020> said<00:02:42.290> quite<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> bit<00:02:42.800> it's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
it makes like I said quite a bit it's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.250 
it makes like I said quite a bit it's
not<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> lot<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.760> work<00:02:44.090> but<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.780> little<00:02:45.050> bit

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
not a lot of work but it is a little bit

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.200 
not a lot of work but it is a little bit
more<00:02:45.440> effort<00:02:45.620> than<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:45.950> opening<00:02:46.820> up<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:47.000> bag

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
more effort than just opening up a bag

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.000 
more effort than just opening up a bag
and<00:02:47.390> pouring<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:47.960> so<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.650> decide

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
and pouring it out so you have to decide

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.160 
and pouring it out so you have to decide
do<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.700> want<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.970> go<00:02:50.090> less<00:02:50.300> expensive<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.020> put

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
do you want to go less expensive and put

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.740 
do you want to go less expensive and put
some<00:02:51.350> labour<00:02:51.590> into<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.070> or<00:02:52.850> do<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.450> want<00:02:53.510> to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
some labour into it or do you want to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.830 
some labour into it or do you want to
get<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:53.960> pre-made<00:02:54.440> into<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.130> already<00:02:55.840> ready

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
get it pre-made into the already ready

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.210 
get it pre-made into the already ready
to<00:02:57.110> use<00:02:57.880> Eco<00:02:58.880> birth<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:00.709> other<00:03:00.860> thing<00:03:01.070> I

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
to use Eco birth so the other thing I

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.870 
to use Eco birth so the other thing I
want<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.459> talk<00:03:01.580> about<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.920> actually

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
want to talk about is that it actually

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.180 
want to talk about is that it actually
absorbs<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.690> breaks<00:03:06.140> down<00:03:06.440> odours<00:03:07.160> and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
absorbs and breaks down odours and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.880 
absorbs and breaks down odours and
wastes<00:03:07.610> which<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.240> a<00:03:08.270> pretty<00:03:08.570> unique<00:03:09.410> feature

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
wastes which is a pretty unique feature

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.050 
wastes which is a pretty unique feature
of<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:11.000> coconut<00:03:11.480> husk<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.550> reducing<00:03:13.550> o<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.910> R

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
of the coconut husk so reducing o it R

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.930 
of the coconut husk so reducing o it R
is<00:03:14.510> certainly<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.110> huge<00:03:15.770> benefit<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.520> bedding

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
is certainly a huge benefit to a bedding

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.140 
is certainly a huge benefit to a bedding
like<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:19.070> last<00:03:19.700> thing<00:03:19.880> I<00:03:19.970> want<00:03:20.120> to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
has found that they mix eco earth with

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.380 
has found that they mix eco earth with
organic<00:03:25.880> fertilizer<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.380> makes<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.890> great

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
organic fertilizer and it makes a great

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.210 
organic fertilizer and it makes a great
terrarium<00:03:29.390> soil<00:03:29.720> for<00:03:30.380> when<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.680> have<00:03:30.890> natural

terrarium soil for when you have natural
plants<00:03:32.030> growing<00:03:32.269> into<00:03:32.630> treasure

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
plants growing into treasure
