00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
take any chances and I know I can beat
most<00:01:45.630> players<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> next

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
most players that way and then the next

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
most players that way and then the next
day<00:01:47.490> Gary<00:01:47.880> says<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.240> himself<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:48.840> today

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
day Gary says to himself all right today

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.429 
day Gary says to himself all right today
I'm<00:01:49.890> gonna<00:01:50.070> work<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:51.000> aggressive<00:01:51.720> game<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
I'm gonna work on my aggressive game and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.620 
I'm gonna work on my aggressive game and
I'm<00:01:53.369> gonna<00:01:53.520> take<00:01:53.790> everything<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> change

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
I'm gonna take everything and change

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
I'm gonna take everything and change
direction<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.290> I'm<00:01:55.350> gonna<00:01:55.500> go<00:01:55.619> down<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> line

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
direction now I'm gonna go down the line

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280 
direction now I'm gonna go down the line
instead<00:01:56.549> I'm<00:01:56.759> gonna<00:01:57.000> aim<00:01:57.240> three<00:01:57.990> inches<00:01:58.229> over

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
instead I'm gonna aim three inches over

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.870 
instead I'm gonna aim three inches over
the<00:01:58.530> net<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.770> hit<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> ball<00:01:59.250> 100<00:01:59.549> miles<00:01:59.700> an

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
hour every time when you when you look

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.060 
hour every time when you when you look
at<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.420> black-and-white<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:04.649> like

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
at it in a very black-and-white way like

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.399 
at it in a very black-and-white way like
that<00:02:05.390> that's<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.600> you're<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.899> gonna<00:02:07.079> see

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that that's when you're not gonna see

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.160 
that that's when you're not gonna see
very<00:02:08.220> many<00:02:08.459> improvements<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.539> least<00:02:09.690> not<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
very many improvements at least not on a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.400 
very many improvements at least not on a
continual<00:02:11.009> basis<00:02:11.489> you'll<00:02:12.209> see<00:02:12.480> improvements

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
continual basis you'll see improvements

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.260 
continual basis you'll see improvements
kind<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.650> pop<00:02:13.830> up<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.489> there<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.209> you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
kind of pop up here and there but you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.910 
kind of pop up here and there but you
won't<00:02:15.569> have<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:16.020> gradual<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:19.620> won't<00:02:19.770> have

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
won't have a very gradual you won't have

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.000 
won't have a very gradual you won't have
a<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.160> gradual<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:21.120> sense<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.470> levels<00:02:22.830> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
a very gradual a sense up the levels of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.699 
a very gradual a sense up the levels of
tennis<00:02:23.459> it'll<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.209> very<00:02:24.569> kind<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.080> incremental

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
tennis it'll be very kind of incremental

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.770 
tennis it'll be very kind of incremental
like<00:02:25.860> one<00:02:26.099> thing<00:02:26.400> at<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.700> time<00:02:26.970> here<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.569> there

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
like one thing at a time here and there

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.240 
like one thing at a time here and there
if<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.080> keep<00:02:28.290> going<00:02:28.530> back<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> forth<00:02:29.160> like

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
if you keep going back and forth like

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.640 
if you keep going back and forth like
that<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> key<00:02:30.629> here<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.080> challenge

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that so the key here is to challenge

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.020 
that so the key here is to challenge
yourself<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.489> bit<00:02:32.610> more<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:32.940> this

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
yourself a little bit more and this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
yourself a little bit more and this
should<00:02:33.209> really<00:02:33.420> start<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.840> practice<00:02:34.290> Gary

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
should really start in practice Gary

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.220 
should really start in practice Gary
what<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.069> recommend<00:02:35.550> with<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> ball<00:02:36.720> machine<00:02:37.080> or

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
what I recommend with a ball machine or

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.800 
what I recommend with a ball machine or
with<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.379> coach<00:02:37.650> or<00:02:37.890> with<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> hitting<00:02:38.430> partner

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
with a coach or with a hitting partner

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.880 
with a coach or with a hitting partner
going<00:02:39.810> back<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.230> example<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.769> maybe

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
going back to that example of maybe

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.410 
going back to that example of maybe
changing<00:02:41.400> direction<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
changing direction and going down the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.059 
changing direction and going down the
line<00:02:42.569> if<00:02:42.920> currently<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:45.060> know<00:02:45.150> let's<00:02:45.390> say

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
line if currently at you know let's say

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.970 
line if currently at you know let's say
60%<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.700> your<00:02:47.970> acceleration<00:02:48.830> potential<00:02:49.830> it's

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
60% of your acceleration potential it's

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.000 
60% of your acceleration potential it's
currently<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:50.489> 60%<00:02:51.200> acceleration<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.830> can

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
currently at 60% acceleration you can

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.300 
currently at 60% acceleration you can
change<00:02:53.370> direction<00:02:53.819> with<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.120> backhands<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
change direction with your backhands and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.430 
change direction with your backhands and
make<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.090> eight<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.690> its<00:02:57.870> head<00:02:58.019> or<00:02:58.200> nine

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
make you know eight on its head or nine

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.490 
make you know eight on its head or nine
out<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.620> ten<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.610> down<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.120> line<00:03:00.470> then<00:03:01.470> I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
out of ten going down the line then I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.809 
out of ten going down the line then I
would<00:03:01.769> challenge<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.610> step<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
would challenge you to just step a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.580 
would challenge you to just step a
little<00:03:03.120> bit<00:03:03.300> outside<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.080> add<00:03:04.230> five

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
little bit outside of that add five

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.070 
little bit outside of that add five
percent<00:03:05.129> or<00:03:05.280> ten<00:03:05.550> percent<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.690> go<00:03:07.050> to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
percent or ten percent to that and go to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.399 
percent or ten percent to that and go to
65<00:03:07.709> or<00:03:07.950> maybe<00:03:08.129> 70<00:03:09.030> percent<00:03:09.480> acceleration<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
65 or maybe 70 percent acceleration and

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.350 
65 or maybe 70 percent acceleration and
see<00:03:10.920> exactly<00:03:11.250> how<00:03:11.519> much<00:03:11.700> your<00:03:11.879> consistency

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
see exactly how much your consistency

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.440 
see exactly how much your consistency
drops<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.560> immediately

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
drops if it immediately

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.170 
drops if it immediately
drops<00:03:15.450> down<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.400> three<00:03:17.400> out<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.580> ten

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
drops down to like three out of ten

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.580 
drops down to like three out of ten
then<00:03:18.540> you've<00:03:18.659> pushed<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.230> little<00:03:19.260> too<00:03:19.560> hard

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
then you've pushed it a little too hard

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.290 
then you've pushed it a little too hard
and<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.370> want<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.580> find<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.879> a<00:03:20.909> little<00:03:21.150> bit

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
and you want to find that a little bit

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.559 
and you want to find that a little bit
that<00:03:21.569> incremental<00:03:23.420> acceleration<00:03:24.420> that

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
that incremental acceleration that

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.449 
that incremental acceleration that
incremental<00:03:25.110> increase<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.040> level<00:03:26.340> of

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
incremental increase in the level of

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.190 
incremental increase in the level of
your<00:03:26.580> shot<00:03:26.849> so<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.810> still<00:03:28.080> be

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
your shot so that you can still be

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.869 
your shot so that you can still be
reasonably<00:03:28.739> consistent<00:03:29.370> if<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.489> can<00:03:29.640> still

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
reasonably consistent if you can still

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.119 
reasonably consistent if you can still
make<00:03:30.000> six<00:03:30.299> seven<00:03:30.659> out<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.810> ten<00:03:31.080> then<00:03:31.680> good<00:03:31.920> you

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129

little<00:03:47.340> bit<00:03:47.459> higher<00:03:47.670> level<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.299> then<00:03:48.659> you<00:03:48.720> go

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
little bit higher level and then you go

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.690 
little bit higher level and then you go
back<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.319> again<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.769> add<00:03:49.890> five<00:03:50.159> or<00:03:50.519> ten

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
go from shot to shot and just you should
