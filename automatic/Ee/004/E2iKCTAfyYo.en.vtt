 hello in shape okay fox know 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.870
 that many housewives are constantly looking for a replacement 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.870
 mayonnaise because store mayonnaise 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.910
 it's not at all clear what 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.810
 homemade mayonnaise raw eggs not all 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.240
 like it and have a fit 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.880
 option whips milk with butter and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 It turns out the consistency of such a thick 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.510
 like my name to me 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.310
 for example, do not like this option 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.579
 I looked very fat 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.820
 very heavy I want to offer you something 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.430
 the other without eggs and even without milk is very 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.329
 delicious and quite self relatively 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.329
 dietary option 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.170
 so we need boiled white 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.410
 my beans are so big she 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.629
 I cooked it like that but she is very 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.420
 very soft already become you can take 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.680
 buy a jar of finished beans and you can 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.960
 also cooked me 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 I have a glass somewhere and also 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 decoction of beans, I left a little 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.390
 because I will close it now 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.409
 blender and if necessary I will regulate 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.509
 consistency using this water here 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.689
 it turned out so creamy enough 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.229
 consistency now I will share a little 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.810
 olive oil will come in here somewhere 3-4 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.790
 tablespoons can be 5 but you 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.329
 see already to your liking 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.329
 I will again add a little and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.479
 I do not like to mix when very fat 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.610
 because I add literally a couple of spoons 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.970
 New oil look there to your liking 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.310
 and of course any can always come up 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.750
 oil does not necessarily have to be 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.770
 olive 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.420
 and now we fill our sauce first 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.420

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.540
