00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the waterfall effect and we've had some

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
the waterfall effect and we've had some
questions<00:00:42.659> about<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.409> you<00:00:43.589> how<00:00:43.860> do

different devices what you're doing is
in<00:00:50.040> that<00:00:50.220> tune<00:00:50.550> we're<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.629> from<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.019> say<00:00:52.559> c

to<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.150> egg<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:02.280> back<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.820> 2<00:01:03.600> chord<00:01:03.900> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to an egg and then back to a 2 chord and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.570 
to an egg and then back to a 2 chord and

5 chord in a sec for Discipline file to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.570 
5 chord in a sec for Discipline file to
create<00:01:08.910> this<00:01:09.150> effect<00:01:09.740> basically<00:01:10.740> you're

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
create this effect basically you're

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
create this effect basically you're
taking<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> elements<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.390> arpeggio<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
taking the elements of the arpeggio of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.719 
taking the elements of the arpeggio of
the<00:01:16.800> chord<00:01:18.619> sometimes<00:01:19.619> including<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> 6th

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
the chord sometimes including the 6th

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.740 
the chord sometimes including the 6th
sometimes<00:01:23.729> including<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> seventh

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:37.310 

sometimes<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.080> inversion<00:01:36.320> basically

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
sometimes in an inversion basically

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.290 
sometimes in an inversion basically
whatever<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.979> get<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.160> hands<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
whatever you can get your hands on so to

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.139 
whatever you can get your hands on so to
speak<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.530> create<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.100> effect<00:01:42.380> now<00:01:44.149> other

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
speak to create this effect now other

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
speak to create this effect now other
players<00:01:45.860> for<00:01:46.860> example<00:01:48.080> lucky<00:01:49.080> Roberts<00:01:49.619> would

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
players for example lucky Roberts would

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.969 
players for example lucky Roberts would
use<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> similar<00:01:51.030> effect<00:01:51.450> where<00:01:52.200> he<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.740> take

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
use a similar effect where he would take

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.010 
use a similar effect where he would take
the<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:55.649> bottom<00:01:56.130> note<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:57.360> chromatically

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the the bottom note and go chromatically

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.709 
the the bottom note and go chromatically
up<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.410> third<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:58.830> fifth<00:01:59.070> like

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.660 

or<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:06.140> would<00:02:06.289> have<00:02:06.320> our<00:02:06.649> Tatum<00:02:07.130> where<00:02:07.369> he

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
or you would have our Tatum where he

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.830 
or you would have our Tatum where he
would<00:02:08.259> take<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:11.180> first<00:02:11.450> note<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.690> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
would take the the first note of the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.449 
would take the the first note of the
court<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.379> then<00:02:12.500> go<00:02:12.739> up<00:02:12.980> in<00:02:13.190> an<00:02:13.310> arpeggio<00:02:18.459> or

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
court and then go up in an arpeggio or

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.650 
court and then go up in an arpeggio or
you<00:02:19.970> would<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:21.110> example<00:02:21.140> love<00:02:22.660> Fats

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
you would have for example love Fats

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.690 
you would have for example love Fats
Waller<00:02:23.780> who<00:02:24.620> would<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.069> come<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.370> with<00:02:25.400> all

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
Waller who would just come up with all

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.580 
Waller who would just come up with all
sorts<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.180> different<00:02:26.360> combinations<00:02:27.170> for<00:02:27.410> this

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
sorts of different combinations for this

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.250 
sorts of different combinations for this
for<00:02:28.040> example<00:02:28.549> I'll<00:02:28.879> play<00:02:29.150> again<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.140> eight

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
for example I'll play again the eight

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:50.400 
for example I'll play again the eight
bars<00:02:30.530> from<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.920> last<00:02:31.129> tune

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.290 

not<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.709> musically<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.490> it's<00:02:52.730> really<00:02:53.030> pretty

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
not so musically it's it's really pretty

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.170 
not so musically it's it's really pretty
simple<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:55.010> trick<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.490> keep<00:02:55.970> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
simple but the trick is to keep the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.970 
simple but the trick is to keep the
variations<00:02:56.810> coming<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.500> doesn't<00:02:57.830> sound

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
variations coming so it doesn't sound

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.150 
variations coming so it doesn't sound
like<00:02:58.250> you're<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.610> doing<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> same<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.890> same

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
like you're just doing the same the same

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.680 
like you're just doing the same the same
chord<00:03:01.520> inversion<00:03:01.940> over<00:03:02.180> again<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.660> this

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.810 

they're<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:10.900> an<00:03:11.020> old<00:03:11.170> player<00:03:11.410> piano<00:03:11.820> you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
they're like an old player piano you

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.130 
they're like an old player piano you
want<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.300> but<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.720> don't<00:03:13.900> want<00:03:14.080> to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
want to have but you don't want to

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.990 
want to have but you don't want to
distract<00:03:14.680> from<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.950> melody<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.460> an<00:03:15.610> effect

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
distract from the melody it's an effect

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.900 
distract from the melody it's an effect
on<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.270> piano<00:03:16.570> it's<00:03:16.810> not<00:03:16.990> really<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:18.520> sort

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
on the piano it's not really a it's sort

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.760 
on the piano it's not really a it's sort
of<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> replacement<00:03:19.780> melody<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.560> not

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
of like a replacement melody it's not

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.510 
of like a replacement melody it's not
like<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.370> melody<00:03:22.330> per<00:03:22.570> se<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:24.010> then<00:03:24.190> again

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
like a a melody per se but then again

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.010 
like a a melody per se but then again
it's<00:03:24.850> not<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.360> outlining<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.080> chords<00:03:26.470> like

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.290 

you<00:03:32.020> want<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.290> put<00:03:32.500> some<00:03:33.250> rhythmic<00:03:33.490> variations

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
you want to put some rhythmic variations

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.590 
you want to put some rhythmic variations
in<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:35.050> also<00:03:35.490> some<00:03:36.490> chord<00:03:36.820> inversions<00:03:37.420> in

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
in it and also some chord inversions in

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:57.250 
in it and also some chord inversions in
it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.590 

that<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.470> course<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.940> could<00:04:00.120> try<00:04:00.330> many

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
that of course you could try many

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.090 
that of course you could try many
different<00:04:00.690> effects<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.800> could<00:04:01.950> do<00:04:02.069> a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
different effects to it you could do a

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:31.790 
different effects to it you could do a
little<00:04:02.250> stop<00:04:02.670> time

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.560 

but<00:04:32.800> whatever<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.490> effect<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.270> want<00:04:34.450> to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
but whatever the effect you want to

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.360 
but whatever the effect you want to
create<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.850> idea<00:04:37.450> is<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:38.560> make<00:04:38.740> it<00:04:38.889> smooth

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
create the the idea is to make it smooth

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.920 
create the the idea is to make it smooth
and<00:04:39.580> there's<00:04:39.700> no<00:04:39.940> better<00:04:40.270> example<00:04:40.480> than

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
and there's no better example than

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.980 
and there's no better example than
listening<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.560> one<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.600> fats<00:04:43.600> Waller's

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
listening to one of fats Waller's

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.629 
listening to one of fats Waller's
recordings<00:04:44.590> where<00:04:44.740> he<00:04:44.889> uses<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.280> effect

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
recordings where he uses this effect

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.590 
recordings where he uses this effect
because<00:04:45.970> he<00:04:46.150> had<00:04:46.330> such<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:48.150> smooth<00:04:49.150> but<00:04:49.570> a

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
because he had such a smooth but a

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.520 
because he had such a smooth but a
powerful<00:04:50.380> approach<00:04:51.389> to<00:04:52.389> his<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:53.500> his

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
powerful approach to his to his

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.720 
powerful approach to his to his
technique<00:04:54.540> that<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:56.500> rest<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.860> this<00:04:56.980> can<00:04:57.550> only

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
technique that the rest of this can only

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.180 
technique that the rest of this can only
just<00:04:58.300> hope<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.720> try<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:58.960> match<00:04:59.350> it<00:04:59.380> but<00:04:59.980> that's

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
just hope to try and match it but that's

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.620 
just hope to try and match it but that's
the<00:05:00.430> basic<00:05:01.830> theory<00:05:02.830> behind<00:05:03.180> fats<00:05:04.180> Waller's

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
the basic theory behind fats Waller's

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.680 
the basic theory behind fats Waller's
waterfall<00:05:05.350> effect
