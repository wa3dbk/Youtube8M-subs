concerned with their their transition

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.410 
concerned with their their transition
offensive<00:01:00.010> transition<00:01:00.370> with<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:01.090> know<00:01:01.210> with

their number 10 and their one of their
forwards<00:01:04.509> up<00:01:04.659> top<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.549> know<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:06.880> that

forwards up top and you know that that

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.090 
forwards up top and you know that that
proved<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.570> be<00:01:07.720> true<00:01:07.899> i<00:01:07.990> think<00:01:08.320> they<00:01:08.469> created<00:01:09.069> a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
proved to be true i think they created a

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.800 
proved to be true i think they created a
couple<00:01:09.609> chances<00:01:09.789> in<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.149> first<00:01:10.299> half<00:01:10.539> off<00:01:10.780> a

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
couple chances in the first half off a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.109 
couple chances in the first half off a
transition<00:01:11.499> although<00:01:12.460> we<00:01:12.609> controlled<00:01:13.030> the

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
transition although we controlled the

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.179 
transition although we controlled the
match<00:01:13.329> and<00:01:13.719> you<00:01:13.960> know<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.229> was<00:01:14.380> still<00:01:14.649> still

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
match and you know that was still still

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.160 
match and you know that was still still
troubling<00:01:15.609> and<00:01:15.789> i<00:01:16.359> think<00:01:16.630> at<00:01:16.780> times<00:01:16.929> we<00:01:17.109> played

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
troubling and i think at times we played

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.719 
troubling and i think at times we played
really<00:01:17.439> good<00:01:17.560> football<00:01:17.889> we<00:01:18.219> create<00:01:18.460> really

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
really good football we create really

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.099 
really good football we create really
good<00:01:18.880> chances<00:01:19.270> but<00:01:19.450> we're<00:01:19.600> still<00:01:19.899> vulnerable

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
good chances but we're still vulnerable

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.399 
good chances but we're still vulnerable
in<00:01:20.679> certain<00:01:21.429> situations<00:01:21.810> when<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:23.170> know<00:01:23.259> we

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
in certain situations when you know we

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.620 
in certain situations when you know we
want<00:01:23.649> we<00:01:23.920> want<00:01:24.069> to<00:01:24.219> avoid<00:01:24.939> that<00:01:24.999> before<00:01:25.539> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
want we want to avoid that before the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.230 
want we want to avoid that before the
game<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:27.100> know<00:01:27.189> we<00:01:27.310> ended<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:27.729> first<00:01:27.909> half
