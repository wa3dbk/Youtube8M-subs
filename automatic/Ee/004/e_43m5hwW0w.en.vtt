00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 it's not in the state of health of the club 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.370
 one was won here in alarming 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.630
 performing rotations she was 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
 gained at mount de marsan by performing 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.280
 a rotation we were also won at dax 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.599
 by doing rotations and you 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 see that next Saturday there will be 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.270
 another team 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 then there will be another one like that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.279
 is part of data of philosophy 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.609
 and moving the team because 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.830
 we have 30 competitive players 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.740
 here are I apprentice players who are 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 able to show beautiful 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.600
 things and raise their game level 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.250
 so today the program the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 problem is that there are players who 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.460
 were still in recovery 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.350
 today we had fed fatafehi 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.020
 which was his first match since the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 pr me we had also crisis and catch 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 it was his first match to say since 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.129
 two months 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 so they scored a little rice one 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.210
 missing some rice they ate a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.100
 little physical density and and that's it and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.199
 the problem is that we are obliged 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.640
 to put everybody in competition 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.640
 and give everyone a chance 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.830
 Halftime rally course 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.370
 for that to stop playing in your 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.400
 case 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.680
 then I defensively here it is 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.730
 demand of course scattered around his 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.130
 plated veneer needs 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.900
 and here it is very quickly to be a lot 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.960
 more aggressive on the man because we have 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.340
 too much suffered in the first half and we have 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.470
 all the time played back 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.540
 so it was complicated in the face of a 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.850
 Pau team who put speed 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.950
 and camille a rhythm to match 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.010
 a really two titles is good if 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.240
 our workshops now trailer after 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:43.210
 our performance in the first match 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.950
 sure to the best franck of course 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.490
 sir was waiting but hey I conjure 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.250
 yiqi little can be taken to a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.280
 effective at a standing 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.340
 I do not need I do not need to 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.170
 that I think everyday launches a sauce 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.060
 to the rhythm of the first two to be able to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.520
 directly access the top 14 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.840
 no I had a team paloise that if we 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.649
 left in the sale that's what 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.170
 happened today 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.410
 and that would be complicated afterwards for 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.980
 here it is to contain 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.980
 last question
