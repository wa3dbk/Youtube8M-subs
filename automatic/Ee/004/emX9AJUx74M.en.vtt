00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.349
 and, well, all right, this is the following 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 I'm testing now a different angle. 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.570
 What is to make you a fan? 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.080
 both if exactly look this here is the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 river deluxe edition of zelda windley 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.840
 to want exact I bought understand and will 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.250
 now I decided to take advantage of this trip 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.380
 to the United States to bring two 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.359
 consoles because I lost two people 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 so I could bring one in the quota of each 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 Aneel person brought here for me. 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.390
 met me in Sao Paulo delivered 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.079
 for the people to bring to curitiba 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.270
 To make a box for you guys this one. 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
 This is the new nintendo video game 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.739
 It took so much younger for me because the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.250
 Let me get it now because I'm 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.660
 now buying mario 3d land or whatever 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.760
 The name that it is going to have that will be the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.850
 next Mario may have a role 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.010
 I'm not going to lie to that. 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.050
 It happens folks I decided now that in the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.600
 next generation I will get all the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.400
 consoles that are coming out and here already 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.680
 a next-generation console wanting 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.689
 or not a yuyo that because I want 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.000
 bring more information to you I 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.280
 I noticed that the public here on youtube has 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.640
 people have changed considerably. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.290
 are changing the focus a little 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.810
 entertainment for the information that is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.299
 is that they are searching here on youtube 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.189
 this explains the rather successful 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.530
 channels as angry but recently the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.600
 brt's channel is early started to focus 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 in several releases as well as the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.530
 my channel in recent months because I 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.350
 brought gta at launch and also the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.280
 pokÃ©mon this has helped my channel a lot 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.780
 so I think people are 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.350
 looking for this thing in fact 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.600
 launch and this ends up causing 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 I want to bring this to you too. 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
 do not stay alone in pc games which is what 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.409
 I do and from time to time an exclusive 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.200

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.790

 I slowly hope it has not been 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.229
 open shop because none have a 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.009

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.550

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.140

 first things we have to 1 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.020
 a source that is slightly smaller than the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 people have a source that is a little larger 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.430

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.310
 here those things of points of the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.110
 nintendo club nintendo was the kind that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.760
 I never saw I never claimed I have 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.700
 that to do this might also 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.350
 prizes opening here we have the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.240
 control charger 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.220
 the charger does not extend from the control 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.230
 let's put it like i love it 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.630
 willmott I do not know what it's like to call 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.820
 crap out of control with the little screen 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.420
 and we have here also yes it's a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.150
 charger for him and this source here 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.690
 the smallest is to carry a control 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.600
 Damn, I'm scared, you race. 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.980
 with the source of xbox 360 that she already j 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.260
 Man looks at this stuff in plastic 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.550
 and guys but look the size of it looks 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.360
 size of this brick in r 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.610
 so folks 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.030
 After that we have our cables. 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.680
 cable fit hdmi cable which is silver 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.540
 which is silver do not want gray do not know 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.820
 because they make it the black console 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.959
 everybody has 17 black television today 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.300
 because this business here is not 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.580
 black also an end and we have ours 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.130
 bar with light sensor so you can 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.800
 use your one and traditional multi in that 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.690
 At the moment I used in your i that also 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.310
 works with wii u 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.910
 let's go now with the parts that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:06.100
 We have control here. 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.630
 special edition of the zelda he has 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.489
 I do not know if you can see these 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.190
 things drawn here from the side 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.200
 the guy is cute, is she really? 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.090
 beautiful 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.609
 Geez, Cool! 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.500
 the only thing different normal time are 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.150
 these drawings in this stature that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.160
 these tribesmen on the side 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.810
 But let's put it here now. 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.270
 because we'll take a look at the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.000
 our 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.289
 face console exactly i understood 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.669
 because I really want to bring the 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.500
 Nintendo releases for you 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.960
 because it is a company that always 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.419
 Lived in my heart I was an item. 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.759
 even the super nintendo 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.379
 Nintendo console is or at least 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.599
 with luck they were playing nintendo games 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.759
 because at the time of the little girl he had a 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.500
 clone system because nobody in brazil 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.169
 I had understood we only had system 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.909
 conic what happens guys and then I 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.300
 I had the super nintendo too but then 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.280
 of the nintendo 64 generation I defended 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.800
 to the side of the sony and did not leave from 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.409
 So, what's happening people here? 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.289
 has il is the one from here version with a 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.539
 I think about 32 gigas if I do not 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.970
 obviously he comes without a game 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.740
 because the game that would come in him that is the 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.169
 twitter who wants what 's here in 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.270
 box that is the remake of a game for the 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.130
 gamecube it comes in digital form 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.789
 I think nintendo is trying 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.039
 proposing is to provide these people go there 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.229
 this thing from their digital sale then 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.729
 You have here probably there is 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.870
 code here obviously I 'm not going 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.000
 take this video I do not want 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.669
 no one claiming my code but 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.130
 Well, this is Nintendo Wii. 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.680
 For you, I decided to buy it. 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.690
 I really wanted to play the man. 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.279
 taking slow to be sincere only that I 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.990
 I did the math if I bought version 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.930
 original that is not the batch version 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.000
 this way nintendo wii u he 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.680
 would come with the une having slow 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.190
 only if I could buy twitter 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.770
 it was $ 49 more but if I buy 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.979
 Sunday lake and buy what I did 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.199
 the oni having between him comes to him him 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.110
 it costs only 29 dollars and I also save money 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.520
 20 dollars in this game is that I 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.110
 I did it here too, people have to show it. 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.550
 You're going to still have a camera now. 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:16.490
 before professionally tandan da 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.380

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.380
 mario game looks like it's getting 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.539
 very cool 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.659

 We have to privilege companies 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:23.449
 that make good policies for Brazil 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.280
 price and sony to microsoft and 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:27.289
 nintendo has never officially released on 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.789
 Brazil then it even deforms even more 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.759
