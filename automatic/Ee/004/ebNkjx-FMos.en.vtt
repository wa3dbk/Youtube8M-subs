00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.230
 Wherever I fly 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.570
 or how much higher must fly, 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.790
 my high singing voice 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.150
 it will reach the ends of the sky. 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.510
 Without stopping to sing, I will continue singing and singing. 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.590
 I will sing until I reach the ends of the sky. 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.190
 If I could not sing more 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.650
 all I would have left would be to cut this language. 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.110
 If I could not fly again 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.430
 all I would have left would be to pluck these wings. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 The sinister voice that resounds in the night 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.470
 It is a bewitching song that attracts darkness. 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.910
 Falling into this bottomless darkness 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.490
 My song is all you can hear. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 The frogs in the pond simply know how blue the sky is. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.120
 But what do you think about the vastness of the sky that you can not reach? 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.170
 The flying birds simply know how vast the sky is. 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.450
 But still, their singing voices can not go very far. 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.110
 Even if I lose this voice 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.530
 My song will not fade. 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.690
 Even if I lose these wings 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.450
 my song will reach this heaven. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.930
 The sinister voice that resounds in the night 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.390
 It is a bewitching song that attracts darkness. 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.810
 Falling into this bottomless darkness 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.410
 My song is all you can hear. 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.900
 If I could not sing more 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.380
 all I would have left would be to cut this language. 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.820
 If I could not fly again 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.120
 all I would have left would be to pluck these wings. 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.660
 Even if I lose this voice 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.100
 My song will not fade. 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.270
 Even if I lose these wings 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.200
 my song will reach this heaven.
