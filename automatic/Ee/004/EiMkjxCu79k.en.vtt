00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello people today I am here once 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.450
 with the cameraman in London with 1 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.150
 but has accompanied behind the camera 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.150
 good day and stefan onyx he has now 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 done and I have a dvd review today 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 the video just for fun inspires why 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.880
 because it does not matter who even in the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.920
 he has distributed film criticism 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.869
 Workshops because I do a lot 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.630
 So the background is that I am now 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.949

 all criticisms always such a flower 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.289
 copies sent to me this time 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.570

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.420
 which are so funny cdu the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.219
 of all kinds and I have that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.450
 since months again, because there 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.010
 Sometimes I do not get that much 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.870
 can work off and I put off there 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 and I am going to stack this whole lot now 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.050
 simply criticize many of them 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 I've always done somehow 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.550
 put something down 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.329
 Here you come pile on it and the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.820

 i have ten seconds time prof my 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.940

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.270

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.380
 I find so much fun while switching away 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.740

 it's about Baader Meinhof earlier and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.079
 He is determined to save with 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.090
 announced the cure of the worst 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.470
 actors all over the world except 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 The twilight series was amazing 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.250
 bad he finds out that his 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.470

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.870
 million spectators in the German 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.550

 father helps him also 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.810
 memory lapses again consuming too 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.220

 Dance choreographies not casted story 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.070

 now a west plays all the time 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.310

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.410

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.880

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.220
 history with changing main role and 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.750
 a man who is the next thing 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.280
 safe jason statham action again 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.050
 Water man otherwise expect action action 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.850
 book made age of crime story 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.310
 subordinate he gets into the fronts 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.750
 between police city ​​so the next one 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.800
 thing is the hidden face for 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.420
 I am an absolute discovery 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.890
 American movies I believe in Chile 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.120
 a woman who finds out that one 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.290
 Geheimversteck in a house there and 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.740
 that's exciting with her 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:55.640
 told and never see the red tide 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.960
 I think a whole movie is to get 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.560
 with patrick swayze and maybe offering 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.360
 by the way, salvaged 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.340
 no idea I have the penalty order 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.360
 form it finally determines the houses 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.440
 I think they still want that 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.790
 I like it again but I have 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.510
 it never made me this the 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.550
 ecstatic 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.780
 the next one is cos change I have 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.280
 never seen of it 's two tv 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.660
 that the last movie on one 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.860
 I do not have a stack either 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.540
 Therefore, thank you for setting 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.060
 that in an erroneous review with 2 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.050
 milliseconds was that I was great 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.560
 I think that can be the sensor 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.360
 friends 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.460
 do you want a video again with 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.270
 other film writes it in the 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.110
 Comments 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.130
 from the heart that is the most important me 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:39.139
 feel forget that was progressing 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.139
 track makes it good is very small
