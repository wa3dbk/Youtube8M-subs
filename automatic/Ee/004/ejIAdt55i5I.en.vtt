well I arrived after about eight days
maybe<00:00:45.629> seven<00:00:45.960> days<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.620> pretty<00:00:46.800> quick<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
maybe seven days it's pretty quick so

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.540 
maybe seven days it's pretty quick so
considering<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.390> Canada<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.370> is

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
considering I'm in Canada and this is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
considering I'm in Canada and this is
important<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> stage<00:00:51.270> usually<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.440> get

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
important to the stage usually we get

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.310 
important to the stage usually we get
stuck<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.039> customs<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.020> although<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.199> not

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
stuck on customs and although that's not

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.470 
stuck on customs and although that's not
fair<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.770> there's<00:00:55.920> pulse<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> gets<00:00:56.879> held

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
fair so there's pulse and it gets held

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080 
fair so there's pulse and it gets held
up<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.930> while<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.489> case<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> didn't

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
up for a while so in this case it didn't
which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.329> awesome<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.899> duty<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.800> handling

seems to be good job so I'm gonna get up
to<00:04:49.539> about<00:04:49.599> 50<00:04:49.960> psi<00:04:50.610> I'll<00:04:51.610> probably<00:04:51.880> be

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
to about 50 psi I'll probably be

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.110 
to about 50 psi I'll probably be
spraying<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:53.199> between<00:04:53.500> 15<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.070> 30<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:54.880> I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
spraying in between 15 and 30 so I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.710 
spraying in between 15 and 30 so I
should<00:04:55.720> have<00:04:55.810> no<00:04:55.960> problems<00:04:56.229> with<00:04:56.289> that

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
should have no problems with that

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.279 
should have no problems with that
because<00:04:58.720> they<00:04:58.930> did<00:04:59.080> not<00:04:59.110> opt<00:04:59.860> for<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:01.139> tank<00:05:02.139> as

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
because they did not opt for the tank as

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.350 
because they did not opt for the tank as
you<00:05:02.410> can<00:05:02.560> see<00:05:02.740> which<00:05:03.699> was<00:05:03.970> probably<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.330> mistake

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
you can see which was probably a mistake

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.909 
you can see which was probably a mistake
I<00:05:04.750> probably<00:05:04.960> should<00:05:05.169> have<00:05:05.199> got<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.470> tanks<00:05:05.710> but

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
I probably should have got the tanks but

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.540 
I probably should have got the tanks but
you<00:05:06.849> know<00:05:07.000> much<00:05:07.449> that<00:05:07.630> plagues<00:05:07.840> me<00:05:07.990> mask<00:05:08.550> and

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
you know much that plagues me mask and

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.430 
you know much that plagues me mask and
uh<00:05:09.729> that's<00:05:10.330> basically<00:05:10.570> it's<00:05:10.990> about<00:05:11.400> 150<00:05:12.400> bucks

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
uh that's basically it's about 150 bucks

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.969 
uh that's basically it's about 150 bucks
stand<00:05:14.440> three<00:05:15.070> elections<00:05:18.870> important<00:05:19.870> rate<00:05:20.139> and
