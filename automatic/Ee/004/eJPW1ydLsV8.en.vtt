that's<00:00:18.930> wired<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.950> you<00:00:20.070> don't<00:00:20.250> have

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that's wired in so that you don't have

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.420 
that's wired in so that you don't have
to<00:00:20.490> use<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.700> IR<00:00:21.060> sensor<00:00:21.300> ever<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:23.310> is

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

volt<00:00:33.030> dual<00:00:33.270> cells<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.720> have<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.050> could<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.260> used

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
volt dual cells I have I could have used

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.530 
volt dual cells I have I could have used
one<00:00:34.560> but<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.430> lazy<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.090> didn't<00:00:36.420> bother

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
one but I'm lazy and didn't bother

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.860 
one but I'm lazy and didn't bother
wiring<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.820> then<00:00:38.820> here's<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> transmitter<00:00:39.540> so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
wiring it then here's a transmitter so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229 
wiring it then here's a transmitter so
the<00:00:40.440> receiver<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.280> receiving<00:00:41.399> static<00:00:42.059> right

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the receiver is receiving static right

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.990 
the receiver is receiving static right
now<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> screen<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.260> showing<00:00:43.320> blue<00:00:44.130> so<00:00:44.969> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
now but the screen is showing blue so I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
now but the screen is showing blue so I
have<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.510> some<00:00:45.750> sort<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.079> um<00:00:46.410> whatever

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
have to get some sort of um whatever

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
have to get some sort of um whatever
it's<00:00:47.489> called<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> VGA<00:00:48.059> converter<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:49.160> don't

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
it's called the VGA converter I don't

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.299 
it's called the VGA converter I don't
know<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.460> seems<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> make<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> show<00:00:51.540> snow

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
know that seems to make it show snow

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.810 
know that seems to make it show snow
here's<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.489> case<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> size<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
here's the case that's the size of the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
here's the case that's the size of the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
bezel screen bezel it's inside its phone
right<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.219> paintable<00:00:59.640> not<00:01:00.539> white<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
right now it's paintable not white so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.740 
right now it's paintable not white so
it's<00:01:01.200> gonna<00:01:01.350> sit<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.950> big<00:01:02.480> inside<00:01:03.480> my

Pelican 1450 case I have my three cell
lithium<00:01:12.570> battery<00:01:13.350> powering<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.130> transmitter

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
lithium battery powering the transmitter

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160 
lithium battery powering the transmitter
which<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.360> getting<00:01:15.600> warm<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
which is going to be getting warm so I

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.000 
which is going to be getting warm so I
turn<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.680> camera<00:01:17.540> GoPro<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:20.900> know<00:01:22.010> it's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
turn on the camera GoPro and know it's

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.780 
turn on the camera GoPro and know it's
transmitting<00:01:23.549> video<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.700> here's<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
transmitting video so there here's a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.600 
transmitting video so there here's a
movie<00:01:27.030> camera<00:01:27.240> around<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.950> picking<00:01:29.580> up

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
movie camera around it's picking up

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.100 
movie camera around it's picking up
video<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> video<00:01:30.390> quality<00:01:30.750> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
video so there's a video quality it's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
video so there's a video quality it's
very<00:01:31.170> good<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.340> don't<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.580> if<00:01:32.670> my

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
very good actually I don't know if my

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
very good actually I don't know if my
cell<00:01:33.299> phone<00:01:33.540> camera<00:01:33.570> picks<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.290> very<00:01:34.439> well

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
cell phone camera picks it up very well

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.740 
cell phone camera picks it up very well
but<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.070> mean<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.060> certainly<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.630> go

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
but I mean you can certainly if I go

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
but I mean you can certainly if I go
beside<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.170> battery<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> rocks

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
beside the battery here I'm on the rocks

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.560 
beside the battery here I'm on the rocks
in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.270> batter

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
in the batter

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.940 
in the batter
come<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.619> battery<00:01:42.409> can<00:01:43.409> certainly<00:01:43.710> read

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
come on the battery can certainly read

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.390 
come on the battery can certainly read
what<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> battery<00:01:44.400> says<00:01:45.560> on<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.829> through<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
what the battery says on it through the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.700 
what the battery says on it through the
GoPro<00:01:47.820> through<00:01:48.090> transmitting<00:01:48.630> see<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> GoPro

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
GoPro through transmitting see the GoPro

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.810 
GoPro through transmitting see the GoPro
transmits<00:01:50.570> widescreen<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.439> 4<00:01:52.829> by<00:01:53.009> 3<00:01:53.310> screen

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
transmits widescreen so my 4 by 3 screen

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.170 
transmits widescreen so my 4 by 3 screen
that<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:55.070> isn't<00:01:58.700> no<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.850> doing<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that I have here isn't no it's doing it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
that I have here isn't no it's doing it
doing<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.509> needs<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:02.040> got<00:02:02.250> the
