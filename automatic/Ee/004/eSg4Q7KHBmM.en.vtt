the<00:00:48.809> shaft<00:00:49.079> construction<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.829> pretty<00:00:49.980> much

the shaft construction is pretty much

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
deal one difference is that these wheels

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.390 
deal one difference is that these wheels
are<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.969> wider<00:01:03.449> diameter<00:01:03.920> wheel<00:01:04.920> even<00:01:05.309> though

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
diameter wheel on this the upshot of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
diameter wheel on this the upshot of
that<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:18.259> handles<00:01:19.259> cracks<00:01:20.540> debris

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that is that handles cracks debris

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.770 
that is that handles cracks debris
better<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.159> feel<00:01:23.460> high<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.600> road

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
better you do feel high off the road

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
better you do feel high off the road
which<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> sort<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> strange<00:01:26.159> feeling<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
which is sort of a strange feeling and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.140 
which is sort of a strange feeling and
when<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> hold<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.659> next<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.970> one<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
when you hold them up next to one of the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
when you hold them up next to one of the
other<00:01:30.299> ones<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.079> difference<00:01:31.439> doesn't<00:01:31.650> look

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
other ones the difference doesn't look

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
other ones the difference doesn't look
like<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.759> does<00:01:32.790> feel<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.420> fair

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
like much but it does feel like a fair

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.210 
like much but it does feel like a fair
bet<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.650> something<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.130> aware

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
bet so that's just something to be aware

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.690 
bet so that's just something to be aware
of<00:01:36.259> with<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> big<00:01:37.530> soft<00:01:37.829> wheels<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.520> ride

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of with the big soft wheels the ride

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.060 
of with the big soft wheels the ride
fairly<00:01:39.659> smooth<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.860> definitely

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
fairly smooth it's it's it's definitely

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.569 
fairly smooth it's it's it's definitely
a<00:01:41.400> stiffer<00:01:41.909> ski<00:01:42.180> which<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:44.070> make<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.399> little

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
a stiffer ski which can make it a little

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.460 
a stiffer ski which can make it a little
bit<00:01:44.759> rougher<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.630> wheels<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> decent

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
bit rougher but the wheels do a decent

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.310 
bit rougher but the wheels do a decent
job<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.950> taking<00:01:47.100> care<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:49.079> holes

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
job of taking care of that the holes

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.319 
job of taking care of that the holes
drilled<00:01:49.860> through<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.460> shaft<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.030> make<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
drilled through the shaft to make the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
drilled through the shaft to make the
ski<00:01:51.540> lighter<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.290> also<00:01:52.500> increase<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> Flex<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
ski lighter but also increase the Flex a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
ski lighter but also increase the Flex a
little<00:01:53.700> bit<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.930> rides<00:01:58.110> good

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
little bit and and so so the rides good

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.679 
little bit and and so so the rides good
definitely<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> variety<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.240> pavement

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
definitely good on a variety of pavement

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.649 
definitely good on a variety of pavement
not<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> best<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.820> certainly<00:02:03.060> play

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
not the best but but certainly play

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.600 
not the best but but certainly play
versatile<00:02:04.520> but<00:02:05.520> overall<00:02:05.759> they<00:02:06.030> work<00:02:06.240> well

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
versatile but overall they work well

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.580 
versatile but overall they work well

the the bigger wheels the bigger
