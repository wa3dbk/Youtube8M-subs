00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.389
 hello I will explain how 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.490
 manufacture a vending machine from 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.259
 dry food for pond fish 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.770
 but it can work for cats for 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.090
 the guinea pigs etc that cost me 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.070
 12060 with some of the material of 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.140
 recovery a part of new equipment 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.550
 then you need a motor 2 turns spit 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.080
 which is in all ovens 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.960
 electric one is easily found 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.700
 chieftaincies a diameter tissue library 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.640
 16 found in brico thing 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.359
 costs 2 euros 40 or 80 for flat business 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.289
 1 cm wide 2 mm thick there 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.570
 it's recuperation 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.769
 a piece of pvc tubes 32 mm 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.440
 diameter 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.449
 it will cost 1 euro 80 the two meters 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.269
 always at brico thing a piece of 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.760
 pvc tubes of 40 mm the city of recovery 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.769
 a plastic box with lid the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.079
 size depends on the amount of 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.569
 croquettes that wanted to put a 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.969
 board about 80 cm out of 10 and one 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.460
 weekly digital programmer who 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.719
 costs 7 euros 90 still at brico 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.100
 total 12 euros is soft 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.170
 so for a start you put the rod 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.380
 threaded in a vice and you wind the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.880
 flat iron around spiral 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.240
 you will get this it's a screw without 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.219
 end 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.689
 it will be later cut to length 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:26.090
 wanted it must be the end of 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.720
 the leaking rod is so to have 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.960
 square 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.300
 about 5 or 6 mm on the side of the month 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.180
 the hole of my pin turn makes 7 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.010
 mm of side so 5 6 it's good and you 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.150
 notice that I solder a washer 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.830
 about two centimeters from 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.320
 the end of the threaded rod we will see 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.000
 just now why so here 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.850
 the major element of the system 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.460
 you see the ti dropped with its washer 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.740
 carey end that is soldered to a 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.470
 end of the worm the screw without 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
 end will be cut off just now here is a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.080
 view of the engine with their son squares and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.710
 another view would cut you a piece 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.680
 of pvc tubes from 32 to the length of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.690
 your hook tank kate plus 8 cm 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.110
 that is to say to let exceed 4 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.020
 centimeters on each side and cut out 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.920
 a window that will allow croquettes 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.080
 to go down into life without women of the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.880
 opposite side to the window you will have 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.760
 cut out you have to be two notches to 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.290
 each end that will allow 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.940
 croquettes to fall into the basin 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.260
 it's still about three 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.989
 centimeters and a half to four centimeters 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.600
 long so here is the tank there 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.209
 will have to cross a hole on either side of 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.900
 diameter about 31 so that the passage 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:47.280
 from the tube to 32 is doing really well and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.230
 that there is no day there the window is 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.260
 find it up and you see that it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.670
 exceeds 4 cm to allow 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.170
 the evacuation of croquettes on the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.560
 left there is the same thing on the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.140
 right 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.260
 so here we fix everything on the board 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.480
 with a single screw lavisse crosses the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.640
 pvc tube it must be very good 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.620
 to insist that they do not go beyond the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.489
 in the pvc tube not to cling 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.040
 to the worm 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.830
 so this life serves to fix the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.600
 tank prevented the pvc tube from doing 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.590
 a left right move and prevent it 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.140
 to turn on himself 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.120
 you'll notice on the right the hole that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.010
 allow them to fall croquettes 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.570
 on this side there indeed it is necessary to foresee 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.370
 that kibble falls on each side 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.019
 of the box because these engines belong to 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.660
 differently either the east coast or 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.860
 the other one depends on the moments 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.630
 so here is the device where he is the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.090
 tank the worm in the bottom 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.490
 the threaded rod that serves dax between the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.430
 engine 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.720
 and the engine tank where the ia the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.840
 lid on the top left 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.050
 pvc tube link of 40 which will serve as 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.730
 protection for the kz and a box in 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.550
 plastic that will serve as a cover for 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.620
 protect the engine in the bottom of the 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.110
 tank you have to put 2 wooden tasso 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.760
 cut at an angle that make a species of 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.820
 hopper which allow the descent of 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.890
 croquettes to the worm 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.140
 I come back on that you will see 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.700
 post the puck if on the right 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.710
 you have to put two vices vertically 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.910
 against the washer is to prevent 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.960
 the kz2 come out of its engine housing 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.610
 a touch of paint and here 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.980
 now the period was ending so 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.450
 you have to connect it to the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.400
 programmer me as far as I'm concerned 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.440
 I programmed three minutes every 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.210
 days at the same time it's up to you to 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560
 see according to the shape of your screw without 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.570
 end and following the number of fish 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.760
 you have and the programmer you the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.050
 plug in on the 220 and every day to 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.500
 the same time the fish will have to 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.240
 eat then it will have to be very 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.090
 attention to attaching the camera to 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.060
 over the water I'm going down as soon as 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.420
 80 cm of concrete 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.220
 ground to hold all that say you well 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.410
 only if the engine falls into the water 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.390
 it's electrocution for all 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.170
 living beings in the pool 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.170
 guarantee 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.850
 so here's the camera sitting on the 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.410
 basin you see there but tish my irons 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.100
 concrete that will be forced into the ground 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.310
 there is no risk there we see the 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.340
 croquettes that start to fall on 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.130
 the surface of the water they will be able to 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.670
 have a snack 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.950
 so I'm going to show you the ancestor of 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.480
 this device the prototype that I had 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.020
 made a few years ago that is 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.020
 in another basin then this one there 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.490
 has two tanks that can put 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.260
 two different types of food I have 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.300
 kibble for him the sturgeon and 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.240
 kibble for school so that's 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.980
 the same principle the tube of 32 and over 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.290
 along the slope and longer ago 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:58.009
 four holes to fall from 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:06:00.619
 croquettes instead of two then 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.169
 do not forget that this system is very 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.309
 good for going on vacation but that the 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.819
 contact with animals 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:10.129
 it's still good 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:13.479
 like for example see my beautiful corner 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.479
 who comes to eat 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.640
 here 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.419
 and that's the snack
