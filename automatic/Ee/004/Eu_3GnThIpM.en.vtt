team I'll also take a quick look here at
the<00:01:50.729> leaderboards<00:01:51.259> swedging<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.350> serine

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the leaderboards swedging and serine

division<00:01:52.950> 2<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.880> we're<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> top<00:01:55.350> twenty

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
division 2 which we're in the top twenty

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.620 
division 2 which we're in the top twenty
thousand<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> fire<00:01:56.430> 51,000<00:01:57.210> total<00:01:57.420> players

so that puts us in like the top I'm
gonna<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.770> some<00:02:01.950> quick<00:02:02.130> math<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.549> guys<00:02:02.729> it's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
gonna do some quick math you guys it's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.160 
gonna do some quick math you guys it's
going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.360> bad<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.719> puts<00:02:03.990> us<00:02:04.049> in

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
going to be really bad that puts us in

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
going to be really bad that puts us in
like<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.350> top<00:02:04.380> four<00:02:04.920> percent<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.340> players<00:02:05.610> in

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
like the top four percent of players in

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
also take a quick look here at like the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.730 
also take a quick look here at like the
other<00:02:11.849> leaderboard<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:12.989> where<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.410> our

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
other leaderboard see where like our

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.830 
other leaderboard see where like our
stats<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.820> guys<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.060> see<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.330> team

not<00:02:19.350> too<00:02:19.890> bad<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.130> don't<00:02:20.280> think<00:02:20.490> um<00:02:21.150> I

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
not too bad I don't think um I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.720 
not too bad I don't think um I
definitely<00:02:23.040> could've<00:02:23.310> been<00:02:23.400> better<00:02:23.520> this

level 12 and a 0% did not finish we
didn't<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.150> did<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.990> know<00:02:40.080> not<00:02:40.260> finished

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
didn't we did I you know not finished

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.810 
didn't we did I you know not finished
some<00:02:40.740> games<00:02:40.950> most<00:02:41.160> time<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.580> doubt<00:02:41.790> but

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
some games most time you like doubt but

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.210 
some games most time you like doubt but
it's<00:02:42.270> probably<00:02:42.690> less<00:02:43.020> than<00:02:43.080> 1%<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:43.920> closer<00:02:44.100> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
it's probably less than 1% and closer to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.520 
it's probably less than 1% and closer to
0<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:44.730> why<00:02:44.820> we<00:02:44.940> get<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.240> 0%<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.380> did

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
0 so that's why we get that 0% and did

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.080 
0 so that's why we get that 0% and did
not<00:02:46.650> finish<00:02:46.920> that's<00:02:47.190> pretty<00:02:47.430> sick<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:48.030> well

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
not finish that's pretty sick as well

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.340 
not finish that's pretty sick as well
guys<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.450> guess<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.690> could<00:02:48.810> show<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.110> player

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
guys I guess I could show you the player

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.110 
guys I guess I could show you the player
statistics<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.980> quickly<00:02:50.400> obviously

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
statistics really quickly obviously

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.850 
statistics really quickly obviously
these<00:02:51.210> are<00:02:51.270> pretty<00:02:51.570> irrelevant<00:02:52.110> has<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.770> know

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
these are pretty irrelevant has you know

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.350 
these are pretty irrelevant has you know
these<00:02:53.040> aren't<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.760> games<00:02:53.940> played<00:02:54.120> with

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.980 
guess thinking you know how much times
gone<00:03:26.550> by<00:03:26.820> right<00:03:27.270> though<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:27.870> see

up for 24 2600 start price will do that
since<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.830> think<00:04:56.009> we<00:04:56.099> have<00:04:56.189> 26<00:04:56.580> cards<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.479> that

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
since I think we have 26 cards in that

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.260 
since I think we have 26 cards in that
trade<00:04:57.840> pile<00:04:58.050> there<00:04:58.289> so<00:04:58.529> that'll<00:04:59.430> be<00:04:59.909> why<00:05:00.060> it's

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
trade pile there so that'll be why it's

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.219 
trade pile there so that'll be why it's
that<00:05:00.449> number<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:00.930> then<00:05:01.650> there<00:05:02.610> we<00:05:02.669> go<00:05:03.139> put<00:05:04.139> it

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
that number and then there we go put it

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.769 
that number and then there we go put it
up<00:05:04.289> for<00:05:04.529> the<00:05:04.680> 2800<00:05:05.099> start<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:05.819> 9400<00:05:06.509> by<00:05:06.599> now

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
up for the 2800 start and a 9400 by now

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.939

will<00:05:07.379> do<00:05:07.439> 9400<00:05:08.099> because<00:05:08.310> it's<00:05:08.430> episode<00:05:08.699> 94<00:05:09.180> and
