macbook this particular one is
twenty-nine<00:00:42.440> dollars<00:00:43.040> 99<00:00:44.140> although<00:00:45.140> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
twenty-nine dollars 99 although the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.529 
twenty-nine dollars 99 although the
cheapest<00:00:45.859> i<00:00:45.980> could<00:00:46.039> find<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:46.520> in<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.699> UK<00:00:47.120> was

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
cheapest i could find it in the UK was

round about the 35 pound mark so the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.869 
round about the 35 pound mark so the
sums<00:00:51.530> don't<00:00:51.769> quite<00:00:51.980> add<00:00:52.010> up<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:52.519> let's<00:00:52.699> have<00:00:52.820> a

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
sums don't quite add up but let's have a

top<00:01:01.489> here<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.980> inside<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:05.120> lined<00:01:06.080> in<00:01:06.290> a

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
top here and inside it is lined in a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.410

very<00:01:06.650> very<00:01:06.890> soft<00:01:07.100> suede<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.000> it's<00:01:08.120> not<00:01:08.240> going

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
very very soft suede so it's not going

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.490 
very very soft suede so it's not going
to<00:01:08.480> scratch<00:01:08.990> at<00:01:09.230> all<00:01:09.410> it's<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.310> little<00:01:10.490> tiny<00:01:11.500> so

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to scratch at all it's a little tiny so

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.410 
to scratch at all it's a little tiny so
catches<00:01:13.130> here<00:01:13.490> which<00:01:13.880> obviously<00:01:14.150> when<00:01:14.390> it's

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
catches here which obviously when it's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.750 
catches here which obviously when it's
in<00:01:14.660> place<00:01:14.690> they're<00:01:15.080> going<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.290> help<00:01:15.500> hold<00:01:16.490> that

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
in place they're going to help hold that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.460 
in place they're going to help hold that
in<00:01:16.939> place<00:01:16.970> we<00:01:17.689> take<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:17.930> look<00:01:18.110> at<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:18.380> a

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
in place we take a look at that in a

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.410 
in place we take a look at that in a
minute<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:19.820> bottom<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.840> much<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.829> same<00:01:22.420> black

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
minute the bottom is much the same black

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.710 
minute the bottom is much the same black
leather<00:01:23.720> on<00:01:23.930> one<00:01:24.110> side<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:25.490> then<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.720> suede

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
leather on one side and then the suede

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.480 
leather on one side and then the suede
lined<00:01:27.350> inside<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.780> let's<00:01:29.930> get<00:01:30.079> my<00:01:30.320> macbook<00:01:31.159> pro

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
lined inside so let's get my macbook pro

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.410 
lined inside so let's get my macbook pro
and<00:01:32.210> we<00:01:32.869> put<00:01:33.079> this<00:01:33.380> into<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.220> case<00:01:34.430> now<00:01:35.360> I

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
and we put this into the case now I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.560 
and we put this into the case now I
think<00:01:35.659> is<00:01:36.439> just<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.950> tightness<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.880> case

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
think is just the tightness of the case

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.980 
think is just the tightness of the case
that's<00:01:39.530> going<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.770> hold<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:40.909> bottom<00:01:41.390> part<00:01:41.689> in

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
that's going to hold that bottom part in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.420 
that's going to hold that bottom part in
place<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.729> top<00:01:44.030> half<00:01:44.860> way<00:01:45.860> pop<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.280> the

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
place and the top half way pop on the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.530 
place and the top half way pop on the
screen<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:48.250> just<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.399> make<00:01:49.430> fitting<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.299> bit

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
screen and just to make fitting it a bit

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.560 
screen and just to make fitting it a bit
easier<00:01:50.570> I'm<00:01:51.140> going<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.380> actually<00:01:51.500> open<00:01:51.950> up<00:01:52.570> my

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
easier I'm going to actually open up my

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.240 
easier I'm going to actually open up my
macbook<00:01:54.350> pro<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.869> just<00:01:56.869> push<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.409> on<00:01:57.619> to<00:01:58.130> the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
macbook pro and just push this on to the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
you a look at the case we've got cut out

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.619 
you a look at the case we've got cut out
here<00:02:18.800> for<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.680> infrared<00:02:21.680> receiver<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:23.420> is

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
here for the infrared receiver this is

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.460 
here for the infrared receiver this is
the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.430 
the
the<00:02:26.040> here<00:02:26.280> opening<00:02:27.270> bun<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the here opening bun this is the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.560 
the here opening bun this is the
SuperDrive<00:02:28.980> slot<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.760> they<00:02:29.880> will<00:02:30.060> remain

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
SuperDrive slot so they will remain

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.220 
SuperDrive slot so they will remain
accessible<00:02:31.580> around<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.760> side<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.420> I've

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
accessible around this side here I've

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.280 
accessible around this side here I've
got<00:02:34.460> access<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> ports<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:36.420> around
