 find on the server the multiplayer 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.140
 with this beautiful sunset 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 in the presence of him the hall the room all the rise 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.679
 why all 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.640
 brokers 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.830
 8% 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.540
 we do not care and for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 then other people who a little later 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.420
 this one good it is true that it is only the recipient I am still young 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.000
 I am pessimistic in the race Mr. China yesterday 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.630
 while the other two finalists so here is this video 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.270
 after what he knew how to do with the cashier 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.600
 the opr oral presentation a small multiplayer server 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.580
 auxerre I play cristie kerr to restart and I'm super happy and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.090
 of the couple 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.130
 a short video of two presentations 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.150
 note that the juke our little dog and gigliotti 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.290
 post 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.190
 and putting the end of the test 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.000
 in the team this server 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.890
 so we lose Eric gerets initially said cuthill killed in 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.630
 July 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.859
 then she will have some technical problems so my question 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.530
 gold 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 but two other groups 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.710
 while the bce purity 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.850
 the principle this faction j citizens the civilians master 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.450
 who is who 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.040
 2 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.050
 these offenses 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.410
 g 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.530
 and restaurants 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 w 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 so that's the time that their servers and i-TV 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.990
 the poorest p 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.099
 cars have been exhausted planes will start a hot air balloon 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.640
 finally we can create a lot of things following the Turkish economy 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.069
 rp five or six to eight people 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.809
 other 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.919
 while never 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.899
 % 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.609
 for the title 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.889
 the hardest on the economy of course I think little brother p 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.239
 she then turned 20% all we have other 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.239
 lose like that 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.669
 a little girl quite 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.819
 following this content 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.059
 that is to say 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.329
 Why 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.509
 m 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.249
 Yes 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.929
 expected in a year 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.479
 k as you can see I just went up to 130 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.180
 4 or translation since france 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 the club of the twentieth this source 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.019
 So here is 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.039
 so possible 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.379
 the layout in shape that I framed for sale on newsstands 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:25.169
 and which one I will put the client in the description in the cube invites you to 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.689
 go see all this 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.699
 e then for the attestation of the brain 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.480
 not much on the forum 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.989
 who is this woman when jonathan 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.989
 % and finally it's all explain to you that for this little video 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.170
 so we can also see that already a lot of construction since as has 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.099
 already said 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.849
 the server etc was created several months ago 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.249
 to be able to slum big body in boat 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.119
 the gap of a region 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.749
 to overcome this hollow 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.010
 here is a couple who are here 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.079
 m 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.229
 that is, something that I canceled 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.149
 for her 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:05.989
 in fact everything is 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.379
 in France 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.329
 with great care 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.829
 c 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.889
 well we will still keep dreaming you did not arrive in a city 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:15.820
 already totally 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.829
 after 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.319
 because the safety 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.099
 I think 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.039
 different projects 2% against 30 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.039
 2 3% google 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:28.970
 indeed 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.970
 then 8 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.490
 10 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.360
 that's so it's very long 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 but we have projects 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.730
 so what else can we add others add others on 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.250
 sordo ah yes uh I'm making a small request 6% the flemmard what am 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.870
 the fabric is in every way that's it 33 'exam t 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.149
 and everything that happens everyone reassures the little ones 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.259
 and in havok charity in the Near East his shot 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.460
 here 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.020
 to then beat for those who do not know stingy of course but on 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.689
 the forum what you say but we do not care 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.539
 so there 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.949
 what else could we add 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.949
 quite simply 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.589
 point 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:27.719
 no 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.210
 I think we went around 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.849
 not finally on my pc 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.569
 and as long as I'm going to live as a victim third time and on the form I 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.279
 will put the link that form the discussion 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.400
 and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.719
 I can say 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.889
 that's what 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.800
 our heart 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.540
 that's why not the 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.559
 ap 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:55.960
 in addition to me 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.830
 gold cooking m 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.219
 exactly 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.839
 and also we would like to add that lost the dough because in fact 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.999
 % 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:09.189

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.210
 exactly
