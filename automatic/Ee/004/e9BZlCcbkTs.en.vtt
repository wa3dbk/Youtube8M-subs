hi since we already got your prediction
what<00:02:15.210> what<00:02:15.600> would<00:02:15.780> be<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> key<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.290> Miami<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
what what would be the key for Miami to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.330 
what what would be the key for Miami to
defy<00:02:17.820> what<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.780> say<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.170> going<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.470> happen<00:02:19.830> and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
defy what you say is going to happen and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.300 
defy what you say is going to happen and
and<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> first<00:02:22.020> title<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.620> big

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and when the first title as the big

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.070 
and when the first title as the big
three<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> obvious<00:02:24.600> that

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
three but it's just the obvious that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.590 
three but it's just the obvious that
lebron<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.070> d-wade<00:02:26.130> more<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.150> LeBron<00:02:27.390> Allah

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
lebron and d-wade more so LeBron Allah

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.690 
lebron and d-wade more so LeBron Allah
he<00:02:27.720> showed<00:02:27.930> us<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.140> game<00:02:28.320> six<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.680> seven<00:02:29.040> what

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
he showed us in game six to seven what

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.090 
he showed us in game six to seven what
the<00:02:29.850> Thunder<00:02:30.270> they<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:31.020> Sefolosha<00:02:31.680> who's

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the Thunder they have Sefolosha who's

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.940 
the Thunder they have Sefolosha who's
going<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> pest<00:02:32.970> all<00:02:33.720> series<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.680> d<00:02:34.920> way

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
going to be a pest all series on d way

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.920 
going to be a pest all series on d way
and<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:35.970> that's<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> be<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:36.870> of

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and I think that's going to be in one of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.270 
and I think that's going to be in one of
those<00:02:37.020> keys<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:37.710> don't<00:02:37.800> talk<00:02:38.010> about<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
those keys that we don't talk about a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.190 
those keys that we don't talk about a
lot<00:02:38.310> now<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> series<00:02:39.300> start<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:40.050> he

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
lot now but as the series start like he

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.660 
lot now but as the series start like he
did<00:02:40.380> with<00:02:40.500> Tony<00:02:40.740> Parker<00:02:40.980> dressed<00:02:41.340> those<00:02:41.490> guys

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
did with Tony Parker dressed those guys

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
did with Tony Parker dressed those guys
I<00:02:41.880> think<00:02:42.360> his<00:02:42.480> imprint<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:42.990> defensive<00:02:43.500> end

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
I think his imprint on the defensive end

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.380 
I think his imprint on the defensive end
Hawking<00:02:44.310> those<00:02:44.430> guys<00:02:44.610> gonna<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.030> difference

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
Hawking those guys gonna be a difference

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.210 
Hawking those guys gonna be a difference
and<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.570> wind<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:45.840> spending<00:02:46.080> time<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.620> LeBron

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
and I wind up spending time on LeBron

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.100 
and I wind up spending time on LeBron
James<00:02:47.460> some<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.180> well<00:02:48.300> exactly<00:02:48.540> exactly<00:02:48.900> i

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
James some to as well exactly exactly i

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.380 
James some to as well exactly exactly i
just<00:02:49.410> think<00:02:49.590> his<00:02:50.370> defense<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.060> wing<00:02:51.210> of

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
just think his defense on the wing of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.670 
just think his defense on the wing of
course<00:02:51.600> he<00:02:51.750> baka<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.110> way<00:02:52.260> he's<00:02:52.380> been<00:02:52.410> playing

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
course he baka the way he's been playing

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.200 
course he baka the way he's been playing
all<00:02:52.860> year<00:02:52.920> long<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.850> think<00:02:54.000> their

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
all year long I just think their

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.930 
all year long I just think their
defenses<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.810> little<00:02:55.020> stronger<00:02:55.440> than<00:02:55.500> Miami's

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
defenses a little stronger than Miami's

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.610 
defenses a little stronger than Miami's
