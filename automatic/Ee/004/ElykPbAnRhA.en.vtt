00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
home
all<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.650> everywhere<00:01:08.250> there's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> dot

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
all right now everywhere there's a dot

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
all right now everywhere there's a dot
is<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.960> move<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> color<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is where you can move the color so you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
is where you can move the color so you
just<00:01:11.490> grab<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.820> color<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.479> move<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> pull<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
just grab a color and move and pull it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
just grab a color and move and pull it
over<00:01:13.439> into<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> wall<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> get

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
over into the wall so I can kind of get

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
over into the wall so I can kind of get
an<00:01:15.270> idea<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.689> what<00:01:15.869> these<00:01:16.020> look<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
an idea of what these look like on a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
an idea of what these look like on a
larger<00:01:17.850> scale<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.720> okay<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
larger scale that's right okay and you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
larger scale that's right okay and you
can<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.830> trim<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.850> are

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
can do your trim as well and these are

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.760 
can do your trim as well and these are
some<00:01:21.210> recommended<00:01:21.630> accent<00:01:22.200> colors<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
some recommended accent colors so you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
some recommended accent colors so you
could<00:01:23.070> take<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> accent<00:01:23.939> trim<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
could take this accent trim here and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
could take this accent trim here and
move<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.759> there<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.909> you've<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.240> khaki

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
move to there and you've got a khaki

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.210

really good idea of getting to see it on

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.990 
really good idea of getting to see it on
a<00:01:31.409> larger<00:01:31.829> scale<00:01:32.009> versus<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> small<00:01:32.850> little
