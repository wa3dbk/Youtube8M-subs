00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.440 
you're up against the ropes here that
kind<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> problem<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.790> often<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.300> is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
kind of is a problem and often this is

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.059 
kind of is a problem and often this is
the<00:02:17.569> way<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.720> move<00:02:17.959> them<00:02:18.230> yeah<00:02:18.709> not<00:02:18.920> really

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
the way you move them yeah not really

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.070 
the way you move them yeah not really
ideal<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.090> does<00:02:20.239> get<00:02:20.420> tough<00:02:20.690> if<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.930> get

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
ideal but it does get tough if you get

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.229 
ideal but it does get tough if you get
stuck<00:02:21.380> up<00:02:21.560> against<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.010> ropes<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.000> can

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
stuck up against the ropes but you can

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.820 
stuck up against the ropes but you can
go<00:02:23.480> ahead<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.780> throw<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.110> right<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.680> left

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
go ahead and throw a right in the left

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.120 
go ahead and throw a right in the left
kind<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.250> go<00:02:25.430> straight

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.530 

that's<00:02:29.130> comported<00:02:29.610> movement<00:02:30.000> somewhat<00:02:30.360> but

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
that's comported movement somewhat but

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
that's comported movement somewhat but
you<00:02:30.630> really<00:02:30.900> are<00:02:31.020> relying<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.590> both<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.980> ropes

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
you really are relying on both the ropes

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.770 
you really are relying on both the ropes
to<00:02:32.460> keep<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> right<00:02:33.120> place<00:02:33.390> then

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
to keep you in the right place then

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.660 
to keep you in the right place then
obviously<00:02:34.290> your<00:02:34.680> hand<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.040> bring<00:02:35.160> them<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.490> and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
obviously your hand to bring them in and

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.730 
obviously your hand to bring them in and
move<00:02:35.760> them<00:02:35.910> around<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.330> well<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:37.470> right<00:02:37.590> real

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
move them around as well all right real

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.990 
move them around as well all right real
quickly<00:02:38.100> want<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.400> with<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> scoring<00:02:38.970> system

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
quickly want to go with a scoring system

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.880 
quickly want to go with a scoring system
here<00:02:39.450> each<00:02:39.720> time<00:02:39.960> they<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.260> hit<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.650> head

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
here each time they get hit in the head

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.400 
here each time they get hit in the head
they<00:02:41.070> lose<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> point<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:42.270> backpack<00:02:42.660> light

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
they lose a point that backpack light

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.290 
they lose a point that backpack light
there<00:02:43.680> changes<00:02:44.160> colors<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.610> indicate<00:02:44.910> David

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
there changes colors to indicate David

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.620 
there changes colors to indicate David
simulate<00:02:45.690> him<00:02:45.900> game<00:02:46.080> hit<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.590> hand<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.630> as

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
simulate him game hit in the hand and as

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.810 
simulate him game hit in the hand and as
you<00:02:48.780> see<00:02:48.900> each<00:02:49.170> time<00:02:49.200> he<00:02:49.620> gets<00:02:49.800> hit<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.580> color

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
you see each time he gets hit that color

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.940 
you see each time he gets hit that color
will<00:02:51.060> change<00:02:51.360> once<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.290> goes<00:02:52.410> down<00:02:52.620> five

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
will change once it goes down five

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.560 
will change once it goes down five
points<00:02:53.250> you're<00:02:53.580> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.820> see<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.150> happens

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
points you're going to see what happens

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.750 
points you're going to see what happens
you'll<00:02:55.020> become<00:02:55.350> deactivated<00:02:56.220> Dave<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.640> hit

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
you'll become deactivated Dave and hit

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.690 
you'll become deactivated Dave and hit
him<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:58.590> hear<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.920> noise<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.190> David's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
him and you hear that noise that David's

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.280 
him and you hear that noise that David's
gonna<00:02:59.880> show<00:03:00.180> he's<00:03:00.360> gonna<00:03:00.570> try<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.840> move<00:03:01.110> them

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
gonna show he's gonna try to move them

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.340 
gonna show he's gonna try to move them
around<00:03:01.520> no<00:03:02.520> go<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.090> guy<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.360> knocked<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:04.080> so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
around no go this guy is knocked out so

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.780 
around no go this guy is knocked out so
that's<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> way<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.890> scoring<00:03:05.220> system<00:03:05.370> works

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
that's the way the scoring system works

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.760 
that's the way the scoring system works
all<00:03:06.780> right<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:07.110> are<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> cool<00:03:07.470> things<00:03:07.680> you

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
all right what are the cool things you

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.870 
all right what are the cool things you
can<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:08.130> here<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.580> couple<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
can do here is there a couple of

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.430 
can do here is there a couple of
different<00:03:09.150> game<00:03:09.300> modes<00:03:09.480> there's<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.840> tag<00:03:10.110> mode

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
different game modes there's a tag mode

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.440 
different game modes there's a tag mode
where<00:03:10.740> one<00:03:11.070> robot<00:03:11.490> moves<00:03:11.760> faster<00:03:12.240> than<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
where one robot moves faster than the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.670 
where one robot moves faster than the
other<00:03:12.690> new<00:03:12.870> trying<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.170> tag<00:03:13.320> each<00:03:13.500> other

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
other new trying to tag each other

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740 
other new trying to tag each other
there's<00:03:14.220> also<00:03:14.370> an<00:03:14.520> autopilot<00:03:15.060> which<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.570> great

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
there's also an autopilot which is great

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.260 
and you're gonna see what happens here
in<00:03:38.340> just<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.580> moment

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.850 

and<00:03:43.270> as<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.660> see<00:03:43.780> I'm<00:03:43.960> not<00:03:44.140> controlling<00:03:44.680> him

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
and as you see I'm not controlling him

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.920 
and as you see I'm not controlling him
he's<00:03:45.280> going<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.670> just<00:03:45.820> punch<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.360> his<00:03:46.510> own<00:03:46.660> so

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
he's going to just punch on his own so

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.200 
he's going to just punch on his own so
this<00:03:46.990> is<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.170> good<00:03:47.380> autopilot<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.820> this<00:03:48.970> way<00:03:49.120> if

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
this is a good autopilot so this way if

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.970 
this is a good autopilot so this way if
you've<00:03:49.330> got<00:03:49.540> what<00:03:49.810> only<00:03:50.020> one<00:03:50.230> player<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.800> you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
you've got what only one player and you

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.470 
you've got what only one player and you
want<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.250> paddle<00:03:51.430> him<00:03:51.700> you've<00:03:51.850> now<00:03:52.000> got<00:03:52.240> a<00:03:52.270> guy

want to paddle him you've now got a guy

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.540 
want to paddle him you've now got a guy
who's<00:03:52.780> battling<00:03:53.140> away<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:54.100> can<00:03:54.250> bring<00:03:54.430> in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
who's battling away you can bring in

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.430 
who's battling away you can bring in
your<00:03:54.640> own<00:03:54.820> guide<00:03:55.030> controlling<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.810> practice

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
your own guide controlling and practice

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.830 
your own guide controlling and practice
finally<00:03:56.860> had<00:03:57.010> someone<00:03:57.430> in<00:03:58.210> terms<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.660> gameplay

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
finally had someone in terms of gameplay

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.540 
finally had someone in terms of gameplay
we<00:03:59.230> probably<00:03:59.440> like<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.950> mode<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.340> best

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
we probably like this mode the best

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.070 
we probably like this mode the best
which<00:04:00.700> is<00:04:00.820> what<00:04:00.910> they<00:04:01.000> call<00:04:01.210> gauntlet<00:04:01.780> as<00:04:01.960> you

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
which is what they call gauntlet as you

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.350 
which is what they call gauntlet as you
see<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.320> strings<00:04:02.680> in<00:04:02.980> tight<00:04:03.340> makes<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.270> you

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
see the strings in tight makes it so you

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.150 
see the strings in tight makes it so you
can't<00:04:04.660> really<00:04:04.840> go<00:04:04.990> the<00:04:05.380> wrong<00:04:05.500> way<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.100> you

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
can't really go the wrong way and you

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.100 
can't really go the wrong way and you
just<00:04:06.310> punch<00:04:06.760> away<00:04:06.910> until<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:07.570> knock<00:04:07.750> someone

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
just punch away until you knock someone

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.990 
just punch away until you knock someone
out<00:04:08.260> or<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:09.070> knock<00:04:09.280> someone<00:04:09.580> down<00:04:09.610> which<00:04:09.880> is

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
out or you knock someone down which is

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.610 
out or you knock someone down which is
even<00:04:10.240> more<00:04:10.270> fun<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:11.140> is<00:04:11.290> probably<00:04:11.560> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
even more fun so this is probably the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.200 
even more fun so this is probably the
mode<00:04:11.800> which<00:04:12.010> kids<00:04:12.310> will<00:04:12.460> like<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.760> best<00:04:12.910> there

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
mode which kids will like the best there

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.420 
mode which kids will like the best there
we<00:04:13.300> go<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:13.570> knock<00:04:13.750> them<00:04:13.960> down<00:04:14.190> also<00:04:15.190> with<00:04:15.340> the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
we go and knock them down also with the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.310 
we go and knock them down also with the
arena<00:04:15.700> set<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.120> get<00:04:16.209> these<00:04:16.360> cardboard<00:04:16.750> droids

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
arena set you get these cardboard droids

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.140 
arena set you get these cardboard droids
four<00:04:17.980> of<00:04:18.070> them<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.340> can<00:04:18.459> put<00:04:18.610> in<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.820> arena

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
four of them you can put in the arena

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.699 
four of them you can put in the arena
and<00:04:19.390> just<00:04:19.660> try<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.810> punch<00:04:20.140> them<00:04:20.290> over<00:04:20.500> and

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
and just try to punch them over and

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.410 
and just try to punch them over and
that's<00:04:21.130> really<00:04:21.459> what<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.790> kids<00:04:21.970> are<00:04:22.090> gonna<00:04:22.210> do

that's really what the kids are gonna do

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.300 
that's really what the kids are gonna do
with<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.720> I'm<00:04:22.900> gonna<00:04:23.020> take<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.770> battle

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
with this I'm gonna take the battle

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.940 
with this I'm gonna take the battle
boards<00:04:24.670> battling<00:04:25.390> robots<00:04:25.750> punch<00:04:26.320> each<00:04:26.500> other

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
boards battling robots punch each other

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.770 
boards battling robots punch each other
punch<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.460> cardboard<00:04:27.850> cut-out<00:04:28.060> robots<00:04:28.540> and

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
punch the cardboard cut-out robots and

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.040 
punch the cardboard cut-out robots and
just<00:04:29.380> have<00:04:29.650> fun<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.100> way<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.850> is<00:04:31.060> fun<00:04:31.390> we

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
just have fun that way and it is fun we

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.420 
just have fun that way and it is fun we
really<00:04:32.320> do<00:04:32.590> like<00:04:32.770> when<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.070> ropes<00:04:33.250> are<00:04:33.400> in

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
really do like when the ropes are in

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.370 
really do like when the ropes are in
close<00:04:33.730> allows<00:04:34.090> for<00:04:34.300> some<00:04:34.450> better<00:04:34.600> battles<00:04:35.050> the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
close allows for some better battles the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.680 
close allows for some better battles the
problem<00:04:35.890> is<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:37.060> constraints<00:04:37.600> of

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
problem is is that the constraints of

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.630 
problem is is that the constraints of
them<00:04:37.840> are<00:04:38.050> very<00:04:38.200> hard<00:04:38.290> so<00:04:38.890> when<00:04:39.370> you're<00:04:39.490> in

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
them are very hard so when you're in

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.370 
them are very hard so when you're in
close<00:04:39.850> like<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.300> battling<00:04:40.840> it's<00:04:41.080> great

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
close like this and battling it's great

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.110 
close like this and battling it's great
but<00:04:41.680> what<00:04:41.800> happens<00:04:42.190> often<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.700> is<00:04:42.820> that<00:04:42.970> they

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
but what happens often is is that they

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.820 
but what happens often is is that they
get<00:04:43.270> spread<00:04:43.570> out<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.990> it's<00:04:44.380> hard<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.770> actually

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
get spread out and it's hard to actually

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.860 
get spread out and it's hard to actually
move<00:04:45.130> them<00:04:45.280> around<00:04:45.400> here<00:04:45.910> will<00:04:46.090> show<00:04:46.330> really

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
move them around here will show really

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.240 
move them around here will show really
the<00:04:46.960> best<00:04:47.140> way<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.320> do<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:47.620> is<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.860> stick<00:04:48.100> your

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
the best way to do it is you stick your

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.220 
the best way to do it is you stick your
hand<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:49.030> pick<00:04:49.210> up<00:04:49.330> your<00:04:49.450> robot<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:50.050> move

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
hand in you pick up your robot you move

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.230 
hand in you pick up your robot you move
them<00:04:50.350> back<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.800> middle<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.490> lack<00:04:52.210> of

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
them back to the middle so the lack of

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.360 
them back to the middle so the lack of
ability<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.810> actually<00:04:53.050> kind<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.890> Center<00:04:54.220> them

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
ability to actually kind of Center them

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.530 
ability to actually kind of Center them
and<00:04:54.520> move<00:04:54.640> them<00:04:54.670> around<00:04:54.820> can<00:04:55.210> really<00:04:55.390> be<00:04:55.510> a

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
and move them around can really be a

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.570 
and move them around can really be a
problem<00:04:56.050> but<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:56.830> fun<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.250> punch<00:04:57.460> around

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
problem but it is fun to punch around

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.980 
problem but it is fun to punch around
and<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.150> kids<00:04:58.390> are<00:04:58.510> probably<00:04:58.600> going<00:04:58.900> to

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
and the kids are probably going to

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.660 
and the kids are probably going to
invent<00:04:59.380> different<00:04:59.560> games<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.100> things<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.490> do

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
invent different games and things to do

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.430 
invent different games and things to do
