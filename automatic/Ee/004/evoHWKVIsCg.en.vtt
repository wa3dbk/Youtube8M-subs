00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.990
 oil has gone from hero to villain 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.950
 uu in its beginnings caused a great impact 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.520
 act with the impulse that this one produced to the development of the countries with the great 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.870
 revolution of the machines electricity the combustion engine 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.210
 internally and with all petroleum products that are present in all 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.209
 the aspects of our lives 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.759
 we are with kitty or in one way or another are independent slaves of something that 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.960
 as we all know it is not renewable 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.689
 but how could that happen? 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.890
 how it was possible that all our effort will be concentrated on doing things 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.170
 who depend on a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 one day it could disappear 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.500
 we do not live 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.860
 the race to get hold of this product and save it to have reserves 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.510
 for a few years it has left millions dead and without remedy 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.520
 those grenades to plan everything for the short term 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.620
 it would be that we were thinking that truly on December 31st 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 year 1999 was the end of the world 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.060
 to think what would be on December 31, 2000 with the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.600
 end of the 20th century 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.439
 I do not find a reasonable explanation but he considered that when we 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.790
 we face problems of planetary scope we do not have the scope to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.110
 that clearly mentions the impact over time 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.790
 see more clearly this human deficiency reflected when 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.700
 estimates of the melting of the north pole have been advanced according to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
 experts in more than 30 years 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.870
 that is to say that our scope does not adjust us to face the 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.170
 consequences that could have any problem that involves everything 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 our planet 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.229
 but then because we have wasted so much time researching other planets and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.700
 beyond our solar system 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.890
 I think we fell into an extreme pride in believing that our planet already 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.429
 we knew everything and we went to see what to find on other planets 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.050
 in fact we are building a space station while our 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.189
 home the earth fell 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.459
 what things will it be that when there is no more life in 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 some will continue to live on the space station 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:23.259
 returning to oil the most absurd thing that this story is that to diminish 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.159
 the vat 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.560
 We are now making fuel from 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.689
 the grains that humans use to feed us 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.529
 how bright 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:39.079
 the world bank just leaked a report that had decked from the 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.579
 2006 where it is made known that the world food crisis that is 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.139
 legalizing the whole humanity is a product of diverting food towards 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.409
 the production of biofuels this report had not been published by 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.789
 what the world bank and I wanted to have conflict with the united states and the union 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:02.459
 European Union who are the ones with the largest production projects in 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.169
 biofuels from corn and other agricultural products 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.519
 but what the world bank wins with that information 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.909
 it is there where the lack of vision and the lack of 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.909
 dimension to grandchild when it comes to planetary problems 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.719
 At some point, the consequences would have to be 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.619
 published 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:30.169
 then why not to sarsa favale as it emanates and bring to light a problem for 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.299
 that those who believe the gods of the celestial court tell me about it 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.919
 the former president 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:41.209
 but while that happens my earthly sisters the ice melts illegal 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:41.890
 to finish 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.430
 sweet water rangel will be finished from what we are doing to solve 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.580
 these problems that will affect the whole humanity indistinctly if 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.620
 we live in a developed country in opposition white blacks if they 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.259
 Korea 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.109
 abbas clouds catrachos guanacos and so on 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.069
 but it is in the world levels that to speak of famine they stay in 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.409
 luxury hotels to enjoy immense carelessness 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.199
 this is not the way to solve the problems 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.199
 what we need is action and action 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.160
 we have let escape the true actions that it develops without harming 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.190
 our planet oil has been an element in recharging the true 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.249
 developing 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:25.279
 suggestion 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:30.559
 are not credible retarded stupid do not use the food of the 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.469
 humans to feed the machines 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:34.680
 until here I stay 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.870
 but I promise that I will return 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.969
 and remember that I am the catracho
