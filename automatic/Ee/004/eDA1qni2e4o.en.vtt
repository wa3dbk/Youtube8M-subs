time for the other ramp to come on and

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.790 
time for the other ramp to come on and

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
along and they will probably end up

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.339 
along and they will probably end up
beating<00:05:14.639> each<00:05:14.940> other<00:05:15.180> up<00:05:15.330> which<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.810> not<00:05:16.050> good

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
beating each other up which is not good
