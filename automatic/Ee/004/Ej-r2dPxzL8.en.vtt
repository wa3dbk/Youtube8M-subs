00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.110 
playthrough it took us a little over six
minutes<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> expect<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> take

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
minutes but you can expect it to take

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
minutes but you can expect it to take
anywhere<00:00:33.480> from<00:00:33.540> six<00:00:34.140> seven<00:00:34.500> minutes<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> as

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
long as 10 to 12 minutes it kind of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.020 
long as 10 to 12 minutes it kind of
depends<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.829> happens<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.489> mission

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and I'll go over that a little bit later

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.960 
may play a role later on in the mission
now<00:01:25.530> let<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:26.009> once<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.759> now

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
now let you know once we get there now

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
now let you know once we get there now
obviously<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.659> buzzards<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.259> needed<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.650> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
obviously a buzzards not needed for this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
obviously a buzzards not needed for this
mission<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.640> use<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.180> this

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
mission we don't use one in this

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.490 
mission we don't use one in this
playthrough<00:01:30.570> mainly<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
playthrough mainly because the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
playthrough mainly because the
helicopter<00:01:31.680> spine<00:01:32.280> isn't<00:01:32.610> anywhere<00:01:33.090> near<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
helicopter spine isn't anywhere near the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
helicopter spine isn't anywhere near the
first<00:01:33.659> objective<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> call<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.100> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
first objective so if you call one in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.440 
first objective so if you call one in
you're<00:01:35.640> probably<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.420> all

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you're probably going to have to go all

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270 
you're probably going to have to go all
the<00:01:36.630> way<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.900> sandy<00:01:37.200> shores<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.650> pick<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.040> so

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the way to sandy shores to pick it up so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
the way to sandy shores to pick it up so
I<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.430> it'd<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.729> better<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.390> call<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I think it'd be better to just call it a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.300 
I think it'd be better to just call it a
helicopter<00:01:40.350> pickup<00:01:40.710> it'd<00:01:40.920> probably<00:01:41.130> be

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
helicopter pickup it'd probably be

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
helicopter pickup it'd probably be
quicker<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.210> remember<00:01:42.299> helicopter

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
quicker but just remember helicopter

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
quicker but just remember helicopter
pickup<00:01:43.290> cost<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.770> thousand<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> buzz<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
pickup cost a thousand and a buzz it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.940 
pickup cost a thousand and a buzz it
only<00:01:45.119> cost<00:01:45.420> 200<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.500> said<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.829> not

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
only cost 200 but like I said it's not

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.319 
only cost 200 but like I said it's not
needed<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.729> use<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.210> this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
needed we don't use one in this

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.300 
needed we don't use one in this
playthrough<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.229> could<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.590> used<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.130> help

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
playthrough but it could be used to help

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.710 
playthrough but it could be used to help
save<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:50.880> time<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> make<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.509> mission

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
save you some time and make this mission

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.330 
save you some time and make this mission
go<00:01:51.930> by<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.409> bit<00:01:52.530> quicker<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.159> once

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
go by a little bit quicker so once

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.039 
go by a little bit quicker so once
you've<00:01:53.490> completed<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.090> first<00:01:54.270> objective<00:01:54.689> the

you've completed the first objective the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.350 
you've completed the first objective the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
path you take to return canyons totally

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
path you take to return canyons totally
up<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.320> preference<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> path<00:01:59.250> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
up to you and your preference the path I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.310 
up to you and your preference the path I
chose<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> video<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> usually

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
chose in this video is the one I usually

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.959 
chose in this video is the one I usually
take<00:02:01.530> mainly<00:02:02.009> because<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.280> find<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.759> little

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
take mainly because I find it a little

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.389 
take mainly because I find it a little
bit<00:02:03.210> quicker<00:02:03.450> than<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> GPS<00:02:04.439> directions<00:02:04.860> but

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
bit quicker than the GPS directions but

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.219 
bit quicker than the GPS directions but
also<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.090> includes<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.750> nice<00:02:06.990> little

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
also because it includes a nice little

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
also because it includes a nice little
stunt<00:02:07.590> jump<00:02:07.829> now<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.069> try<00:02:08.340> using<00:02:08.550> cinematic

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
stunt jump now I try using cinematic

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.940 
stunt jump now I try using cinematic
mode<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.050> beginning<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.619> almost

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
mode here in the beginning but almost

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.010 
mode here in the beginning but almost
crash<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.700> won't<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.120> any<00:02:12.360> until<00:02:12.629> later

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
crash so you won't see any until later

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.430 
crash so you won't see any until later
on

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
on

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.780 
on
video<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.860> make<00:02:13.980> sure<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.220> stick<00:02:14.370> around<00:02:14.400> for

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
video so make sure you stick around for

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.890 
video so make sure you stick around for
that<00:02:14.820> now<00:02:15.180> back<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.510> what<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.660> was<00:02:15.750> saying

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that now back to what I was saying

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.780 
that now back to what I was saying
earlier<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.710> think<00:02:16.740> it's<00:02:17.040> important<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.640> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
earlier I think it's important that you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.000 
earlier I think it's important that you
kill<00:02:18.060> as<00:02:18.210> many<00:02:18.240> enemies<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.410> at<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
kill as many enemies that you can at the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.830 
kill as many enemies that you can at the
meth<00:02:20.220> lab<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.910> beginning<00:02:21.360> because<00:02:21.600> at

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
meth lab in the beginning because at

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.540 
meth lab in the beginning because at
least<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.110> my<00:02:22.260> experience<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.980> feels<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
least in my experience it feels like the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.010 
least in my experience it feels like the
more<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> kill<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.300> beginning<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> less

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
more you kill in the beginning the less

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.720 
more you kill in the beginning the less
you're<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.440> encounter<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.460> canyon

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you're going to encounter at the canyon

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
you're going to encounter at the canyon
which<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.330> what<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.630> want<00:02:27.810> because<00:02:28.230> if

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
which is what you want because if

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.720 
which is what you want because if
there's<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.680> lot<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.890> enemies<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.460> canyon

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
there's a lot of enemies at the canyon

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.400 
there's a lot of enemies at the canyon
there's<00:02:30.180> likely<00:02:30.360> going<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.780> enemies<00:02:31.050> in

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
there's likely going to be enemies in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.230 
there's likely going to be enemies in
the<00:02:31.620> boat<00:02:31.800> already<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.760> they're<00:02:32.970> most<00:02:33.120> likely

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the boat already and they're most likely

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.060 
the boat already and they're most likely
going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.720> drive<00:02:33.960> off<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.380> soon<00:02:34.530> as<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.740> arrive

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
going to drive off as soon as you arrive

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.740 
going to drive off as soon as you arrive
at<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> canyon<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.880> then<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.240> gotta<00:02:36.450> get<00:02:36.660> in

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
at the canyon and then you gotta get in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.990 
at the canyon and then you gotta get in
the<00:02:36.840> bow<00:02:37.020> or<00:02:37.440> drive<00:02:37.860> your<00:02:38.070> car<00:02:38.280> along<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the bow or drive your car along the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.850 
the bow or drive your car along the
canyon<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.600> chase<00:02:39.930> them<00:02:40.110> down<00:02:40.140> which<00:02:40.740> is

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
canyon and chase them down which is

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.530 
canyon and chase them down which is
going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.070> add<00:02:41.250> more<00:02:41.460> time<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.940> mission<00:02:42.360> if

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
going to add more time to the mission if

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.760 
going to add more time to the mission if
you<00:02:42.660> don't<00:02:42.840> cut<00:02:43.020> them<00:02:43.080> off<00:02:43.260> soon<00:02:43.470> enough

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
you don't cut them off soon enough

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.750 
you don't cut them off soon enough
because<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.190> don't<00:02:44.370> get<00:02:44.520> there<00:02:44.730> soon

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
because if you don't get there soon

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.850 
because if you don't get there soon
enough<00:02:44.970> they'll<00:02:45.570> eventually<00:02:45.840> drive<00:02:46.650> their

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
enough they'll eventually drive their

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.960 
enough they'll eventually drive their
boats<00:02:47.070> all<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> way<00:02:47.490> out<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> Pacific

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
boats all the way out to the Pacific

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.730 
boats all the way out to the Pacific
Ocean<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.960> don't<00:02:49.110> want<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> waste<00:02:49.380> your<00:02:49.500> time

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
Ocean you don't want to waste your time

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.260 
Ocean you don't want to waste your time
going<00:02:49.800> all<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> way<00:02:50.370> out<00:02:50.400> there<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.240> sure

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
going all the way out there so be sure

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.330 
going all the way out there so be sure
to<00:02:51.510> kill<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:51.930> many<00:02:51.960> enemies<00:02:52.290> as<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.800> can<00:02:53.040> in

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
to kill as many enemies as you can in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.650 
to kill as many enemies as you can in
the<00:02:53.460> beginning<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> believe<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.480> won't

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
the beginning and I believe you won't

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.840 
the beginning and I believe you won't
have<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.990> encounter<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.710> many<00:02:55.980> enemies<00:02:56.370> at<00:02:56.610> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
have to encounter as many enemies at the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.730 
have to encounter as many enemies at the
canyon<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.570> way<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:58.080> avoid<00:02:58.200> having<00:02:58.620> to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
canyon that way you can avoid having to

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.500 
canyon that way you can avoid having to
chase<00:02:58.980> them<00:02:59.190> altogether<00:02:59.520> which<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.210> what<00:03:00.360> we

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
chase them altogether which is what we

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420 
chase them altogether which is what we
do<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:00.930> video<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.920> said<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.400> my

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
do in this video so like I said in my

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.670 
do in this video so like I said in my
experience<00:03:03.240> it<00:03:03.630> tends<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.050> make<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.410> mission

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
experience it tends to make the mission

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
experience it tends to make the mission
go<00:03:04.770> by<00:03:04.950> faster<00:03:05.460> when<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.730> kill<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> enemies

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
go by faster when you kill the enemies

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.940 
go by faster when you kill the enemies
in<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> beginning<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.530> did<00:03:07.710> in<00:03:07.830> this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
in the beginning like we did in this

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.650 
in the beginning like we did in this
playthrough<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:08.850> for<00:03:09.030> any<00:03:09.150> reason<00:03:09.240> they

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
playthrough but if for any reason they

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.390 
playthrough but if for any reason they
do<00:03:09.720> get<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.290> boat<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.680> drive<00:03:10.980> off<00:03:11.190> down

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
do get in the boat and drive off down

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.160 
do get in the boat and drive off down
the<00:03:11.550> canyon<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.360> said<00:03:12.540> earlier<00:03:12.570> all<00:03:12.930> you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the canyon like I said earlier all you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.420 
the canyon like I said earlier all you
have<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.380> do<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.620> get<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.920> boat<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.160> chase

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
have to do is get in the boat and chase

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.130 
have to do is get in the boat and chase
them<00:03:14.610> down<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.300> can<00:03:15.450> drive<00:03:15.630> along<00:03:15.900> one<00:03:16.110> of

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
them down or you can drive along one of

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.960 
them down or you can drive along one of
the<00:03:16.320> sides<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.830> canyon<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.400> cut<00:03:17.670> them<00:03:17.820> off

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
the sides of the canyon and cut them off

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.970 
the sides of the canyon and cut them off
and<00:03:18.270> get<00:03:18.390> them<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.020> way<00:03:19.050> another<00:03:19.709> quick

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and get them in that way another quick

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.740 
and get them in that way another quick
pro<00:03:20.220> tip<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.550> wanted<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.880> mention<00:03:21.030> before<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.510> go

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
pro tip I wanted to mention before I go

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.660 
pro tip I wanted to mention before I go
is<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.110> there's<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.410> total<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:23.100> two<00:03:23.310> packages

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
is that there's a total of two packages

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.760 
is that there's a total of two packages
of<00:03:23.850> meth<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.600> can<00:03:24.780> steal<00:03:25.050> but<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.680> only

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
of meth that you can steal but you only

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.800 
of meth that you can steal but you only
need<00:03:25.920> one<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.580> pass<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.970> mission<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.600> say<00:03:27.780> for

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
need one to pass the mission so say for

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.750 
need one to pass the mission so say for
example<00:03:28.050> all<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.950> your<00:03:29.100> teammates<00:03:29.430> that

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
example all of your teammates that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.460 
example all of your teammates that
before<00:03:30.180> getting<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.660> canyon<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.230> it's

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
before getting to the canyon and it's

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.810 
before getting to the canyon and it's
just<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.830> left<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.370> there's<00:03:32.489> two<00:03:32.640> packages

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
just you left and there's two packages

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.190 
just you left and there's two packages
of<00:03:33.150> code<00:03:33.450> what<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.690> would<00:03:33.930> do<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:34.140> that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
of code what I would do in that

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.590 
of code what I would do in that
situation<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:35.100> either<00:03:35.340> shoot<00:03:35.700> or<00:03:35.940> blow<00:03:36.239> up<00:03:36.420> one

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
situation is either shoot or blow up one

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.120 
situation is either shoot or blow up one
of<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.750> packages<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.320> code<00:03:37.500> retrieve<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
of the packages that code retrieve the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.250 
of the packages that code retrieve the
other<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.670> return<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.180> trevors<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:40.020> way

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
other and return it to trevors that way

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.170 
other and return it to trevors that way
I<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.650> avoid<00:03:41.070> having<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.520> go<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.730> traverse

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
I can avoid having to go to traverse

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.910 
I can avoid having to go to traverse
drop<00:03:42.390> off<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.720> first<00:03:42.959> package<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:43.769> go

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
drop off the first package and then go

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.590 
drop off the first package and then go
back<00:03:44.040> all<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.280> way<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.730> canyon<00:03:44.940> retrieve

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
back all the way to the canyon retrieve

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.300 
back all the way to the canyon retrieve
the<00:03:45.750> second<00:03:46.080> package<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.650> then<00:03:46.769> go<00:03:46.950> back<00:03:46.980> all

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
the second package and then go back all

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.949 
the second package and then go back all
the<00:03:47.340> way<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.550> trevors<00:03:47.970> again<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.480> deliver<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
the way to trevors again and deliver the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.020 
the way to trevors again and deliver the
second<00:03:49.290> package<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.860> don't<00:03:50.130> need<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.610> deliver

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
second package you don't need to deliver

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.699 
second package you don't need to deliver
both<00:03:51.300> packages<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.110> like<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.320> said<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.680> can

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
both packages and like I said you can

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.650 
both packages and like I said you can
either<00:03:52.950> shoot<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.489> or<00:03:53.700> blow<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.180> up<00:03:54.300> so<00:03:54.480> keep

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
either shoot it or blow it up so keep

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.210 
either shoot it or blow it up so keep
that<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:54.840> mind<00:03:54.959> if<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.350> your<00:03:55.530> teammates<00:03:55.950> diet

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
that in mind if I your teammates diet

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.680 
that in mind if I your teammates diet
because<00:03:56.550> it's<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.790> good<00:03:56.970> way<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.180> making<00:03:57.570> this

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
because it's a good way of making this

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.449 
because it's a good way of making this
mission<00:03:57.989> go<00:03:58.110> by<00:03:58.260> faster<00:03:58.800> now<00:03:59.070> when<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.310> comes

around the same amount of time so it's

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.780
