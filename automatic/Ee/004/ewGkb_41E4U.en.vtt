00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hello 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.839
 I'm back with a new video 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.329
 finally today I will talk to you I will do one 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.190
 review on a product that i am 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.710
 using for a long time now 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.679
 more than a product an object and it is 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.640
 practically face cleansing of goals that 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.289
 what then is this contraption here like 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.769
 you can see that it is nothing but 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.839
 it's a kind of migration from the create 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.550
 sonic what the create the money that a 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.140
 object that is used for cleaning 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.780
 of the face 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.219
 then this teamtec face cleansing is 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.020
 a little different to skip the sonic because 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.219
 directly from the club the dreams plus this 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.809
 not empty but only vibrates and is me 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:55.750
 arrived this along with four others 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:04.059
 brushes that I'll show you now and 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:05.880
 these are practically these here 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.040
 Now I show you one by one 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.560
 we have the sensitive brush that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.780
 practically the softest it has 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.259
 just the very soft bristles from 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.320
 normal brush for normal skin types 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.150
 the brush is a little thicker and 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.270
 we brush it 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.630
 the feeling what is here black and white 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.860
 we have this other toothbrush is not 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.490
 a situation more than anything else 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.560
 sponge a sort of latex sponges 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.290
 but it's not really latex I'll tell you later 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.010
 also what are they and then the latter in 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.000
 which with these three little things that the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.890
 reckless massage we say then the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.750
 sense brush for what I have 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.180
 said that the industry's most delicate a little 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.610
 softer then there is the norm that a little 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.150
 this thicker here with this one 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.830
 sponge that is used for the use of 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.890
 creams to try to get absorbed 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:09.050
 better the creams on the skin the product 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.209
 arrives with his support and batteries 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.150
 normal batteries and then it will come too 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.620
 a somatic custody of these where 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.240
 these go to the cesima from 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.600
 they travel as you can put inside 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.180
 this one and the various heads then 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.209
 let's start from the fact that I this a 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.850
 read it bought by gays and I paid it 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.500
 about 40 90 I'm wrong anyway 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.880
 fifty euros 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.850
 but many girls told me that 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.500
 they also found it on privalia a 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.460
 about 30 euros so given dates 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.430
 quick View 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.470
 however, I leave the links in the box for 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.530
 buy it on e bay 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.760
 so why did I buy this 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.740
 adds i bought it because having one 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.920
 skin culture I wanted to see if 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.950
 indeed there were improvements 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.950
 I knew that sonic clarinet was indeed 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.270
 a miracle for the skin blackheads though 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.940
 I didn't want to spend all that money 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.660
 because it costs a lot so brought 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.220
 for this low cost alternative and vi 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.820
 I have to say that they used to 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.120
 four months then I start 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.980
 used the normal whisk brush 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.610
 I thought for a fat skin maybe 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.260
 I can understand it better the norm is 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.400
 went a bit annoying on the skin 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.290
 because obviously an irritated apple 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.990
 bristles were too hard for my type 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.200
 of leather so opted to try the 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.450
 sensitive and I am three I found myself 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.790
 much better I used it a 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.900
 every day until now the psychic 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.610
 now it's starting to ruin e 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.310
 at the beginning I have to tell the life I don't have 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.450
 found improvements on my type 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.000
 leather made 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.060
 I used it for about how I feel not 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.430
 I had seen great improvements after a 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.540
 then two months have passed 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.700
 just started seeing i 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.600
 improvements on the skin and I have to tell you 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.490
 that I noticed less blackheads and skin 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.300
 it was definitely much softer and 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.230
 much smoother and began to 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.919
 check even less pimples too 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.859
 convent period our bloody period 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.260
 where, anyway, everybody comes up some 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.870
 brufoletto that to me instead I am not 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.530
 out the actual results I saw them 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.900
 after a month and a half of use 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.810
 constant without ever stopping 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.360
 use it morning and evening I have it 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.639
 used with this product here 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.800
 which is the aleppo soap I use 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.320
 for the face and as I told you I have 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.419
 found really good especially I have 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.539
 noticed fewer black points on the part 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.750
 precisely delegate raised to give us a little 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.750
 more 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:03.120
 ok now that the brush is sensitive if 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.120
 a little consumed I'm using the 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.520
 normal the reasons that despite this 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.289
 just the norm is not really good for me 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.930
 on because he's starting me at 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.710
 dry this part of the face feel 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.120
 own very very dry skin is 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.490
 however I'm using this because in 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.590
 reality the parts of this device yes 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.110
 they all mean us together 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.490
 spends that 7 euros and you all arrive e 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.289
 five toothbrushes and therefore not 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.270
 they are sold separately 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.639
 so before he bought them all he wanted 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.590
 a little exploit these is this that me 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.700
 is giving a little annoyance in fact is 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.700
 drying out this area 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.920
 face so I still have to buy 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.710
 the whole set to use the sensitive 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.440
 now I tell you which of these spaces 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.180
 absolute nisa in the most liked and I have to 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.080
 tell you that I absolutely liked it 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.700
 this one with the sponge because I have 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.960
 always had difficulty getting absorbed 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.150
 on my skin 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.130
 creams because you have oily skin 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.680
 not both served well instead thanks to 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.300
 this sponge and latex can do 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.490
 better absorb the beliefs on mine 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.260
 skin therefore definitely does not remain 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.640
 the only one on the skin then hired not 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.570
 I can be a child of this 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:15.180
 very effective sponge and between a child 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.950
 if you have skin like mine the one that 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.660
 I used less indeed those that 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.920
 Wearers were these two 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.700
 the one for the passages because 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.070
 sincerely not much massages and what 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.850
 I find writing quite the same 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.900
 to the norm that is equal as only the 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.250
 fact that it is black and white is anyway 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.840
 I prefer to do the exchange with 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.900
 hands and not with this adds why 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.640
 I believe that the dots in the eye 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.190
 they get inside the bristles so not 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.270
 they go just to sell their own 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:52.530
 scrub then decided my judgment for 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.390
 this product and it's not a nice name I have to 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.860
 to say I can not do more for less 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.160
 regarding facial cleansing 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.430
 because I also tell you this one 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.800
 time I tried to put on a nice one 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.550
 foundation of the heavy ones or the side 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.400
 the make-up remover after which I am 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.200
 past the fresh and teach to wash 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.940
 the face and I must say that even if mine 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.400
 land and looked completely clean 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.680
 the brush was completely dirty 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.440
 so for those who wear make-up with del 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.510
 Our fairly heavy foundation 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.960
 advice because bartoli in depth 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:32.340
 the skin then as I told you mine 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.470
 judgment is completely positive is 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.750
 really positive then right 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.600
 I recommend try it and let me know 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.070
 you have tried in short as herbie cvc 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.300
 in short, you find that the boys 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.210
 they said they are fine 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.730
 and indeed our advice 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.070
 this is the whole world not big kiss 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.070
 see you next time 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.070
 Hello
