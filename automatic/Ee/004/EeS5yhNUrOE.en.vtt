he should with these high dribbling
numbers<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.949> I<00:03:30.370> just<00:03:30.790> think<00:03:31.060> there's<00:03:31.209> going

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
numbers and I just think there's going

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.030 
numbers and I just think there's going
to<00:03:31.389> be<00:03:31.419> a<00:03:31.509> lot<00:03:31.659> of<00:03:31.720> better<00:03:31.930> options<00:03:32.139> i<00:03:32.620> expect

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and they were cheaper and they weren't

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.089 
and they were cheaper and they weren't
rated<00:03:48.069> as<00:03:48.250> high<00:03:49.290> lastly<00:03:50.290> we've<00:03:50.439> got<00:03:50.620> David

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
rated as high lastly we've got David

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.039 
rated as high lastly we've got David
Silva<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.729> saddens<00:03:52.000> me<00:03:52.389> to<00:03:52.629> have<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.900> put

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
Silva and it saddens me to have to put

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.050 
Silva and it saddens me to have to put
them<00:03:53.169> into<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:53.470> category<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.790> with<00:03:55.030> that

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
them into this category but with that

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.149 
them into this category but with that
position<00:03:55.409> transition<00:03:56.409> I<00:03:56.590> think<00:03:56.949> he's<00:03:57.040> going

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
position transition I think he's going

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.189 
position transition I think he's going
to<00:03:57.220> struggle<00:03:57.459> in<00:03:57.669> fifa15<00:03:58.060> as<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.840> left

midfielder or a left winger instead of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.849 
midfielder or a left winger instead of
that<00:04:01.090> central<00:04:01.540> role<00:04:01.750> at<00:04:01.959> two<00:04:02.139> star<00:04:02.409> weak<00:04:02.590> foot

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
that central role at two star weak foot

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.039 
that central role at two star weak foot
that<00:04:03.370> puts<00:04:03.609> a<00:04:03.699> damper<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.120> him<00:04:04.389> when<00:04:04.750> he<00:04:04.840> cuts

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
that puts a damper on him when he cuts

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.509 
that puts a damper on him when he cuts
inside<00:04:05.199> is<00:04:05.650> he<00:04:05.739> gonna<00:04:05.859> finesse<00:04:06.159> it<00:04:06.280> with<00:04:06.400> his

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
inside is he gonna finesse it with his

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
the back of the net I don't think so

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.729 
the back of the net I don't think so
that's<00:04:10.359> not<00:04:10.540> going<00:04:10.719> to<00:04:10.810> happen<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.319> he

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
that's not going to happen and he

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.309 
that's not going to happen and he
doesn't<00:04:12.040> have<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.159> speed<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.879> strength<00:04:13.329> even

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.809 
doesn't have the speed the strength even
his<00:04:14.650> skill<00:04:14.919> moves<00:04:15.159> I<00:04:15.370> don't<00:04:15.549> know<00:04:15.639> if<00:04:15.729> it's

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
his skill moves I don't know if it's

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.550 
his skill moves I don't know if it's
gonna<00:04:15.909> be<00:04:16.090> enough<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.570> really<00:04:16.780> attack<00:04:17.349> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
gonna be enough to really attack the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.349 
gonna be enough to really attack the
wings<00:04:17.799> or<00:04:18.219> to<00:04:18.609> open<00:04:18.820> up<00:04:18.940> more<00:04:19.060> space<00:04:19.299> for
