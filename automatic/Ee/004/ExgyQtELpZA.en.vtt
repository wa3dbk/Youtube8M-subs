a<00:00:41.760> deer<00:00:42.120> antler<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.870> between<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.350> but

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
a deer antler that's in between them but

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
a deer antler that's in between them but
pretty<00:00:45.030> easy<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.420> mean<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.710> whole

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
pretty easy I mean it's it's not a whole

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.689 
pretty easy I mean it's it's not a whole
lot<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
lot to it

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.110 
lot to it
but<00:00:48.710> here's<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.920> few<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:52.309> Spurs<00:00:53.309> these<00:00:53.940> are

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
but here's a few of the Spurs these are

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
but here's a few of the Spurs these are
as<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:54.960> they're<00:00:55.140> they're<00:00:55.530> frozen

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
as you can see they're they're frozen

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
as you can see they're they're frozen
make<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> easier<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> cut<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> bandsaw<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
make it easier to cut on the bandsaw you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.490 
make it easier to cut on the bandsaw you
can<00:00:58.140> use<00:00:58.260> hacksaw<00:00:58.679> bit<00:00:59.329> bandsaw<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.570> freeze

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
can use hacksaw bit bandsaw I freeze

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.549 
can use hacksaw bit bandsaw I freeze
them<00:01:01.679> the<00:01:02.250> whole<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.820> whole<00:01:02.850> leg<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
them the whole the whole leg and that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.660 
them the whole the whole leg and that
way<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.800> can<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:04.920> take<00:01:05.160> it<00:01:05.190> over<00:01:05.370> now<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
way you can just take it over now and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
way you can just take it over now and
run<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> bandsaw<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.050> everything's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
run it on the bandsaw and everything's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.520 
run it on the bandsaw and everything's
still<00:01:08.340> solid<00:01:08.940> so<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> makes<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.690> cutting<00:01:10.440> them

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
still solid so it makes it cutting them

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
still solid so it makes it cutting them
pretty<00:01:10.980> easy<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.090> head<00:01:12.210> over<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
pretty easy so we head over to the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.440 
pretty easy so we head over to the
bandsaw<00:01:13.610> there's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> couple<00:01:14.880> ways<00:01:15.120> that<00:01:15.150> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
bandsaw there's a couple ways that you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.530 
bandsaw there's a couple ways that you
can<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:16.230> can<00:01:16.380> cut<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.180> one<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.300> can<00:01:18.450> do

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
can you can cut these a one you can do

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.160 
can you can cut these a one you can do
like<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:18.810> showed<00:01:19.020> earlier<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.620> a<00:01:19.650> bead<00:01:20.280> or

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
like I showed earlier and put a bead or

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.240 
like I showed earlier and put a bead or
a<00:01:22.850> spacer<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.240> between<00:01:24.300> and<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.980> you<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.160> it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a spacer in between and so if you do it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
a spacer in between and so if you do it
that<00:01:26.400> way<00:01:26.460> you're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.300> want<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:27.540> cut<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that way you're going to want to cut it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.060 
that way you're going to want to cut it
right<00:01:27.990> next<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.400> spur<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.540> side<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.640 
right next to the spur on this side and
right<00:01:32.070> next<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> spur<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.630> side<00:01:33.870> so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
right next to the spur on this side so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
right next to the spur on this side so
that<00:01:34.830> way<00:01:34.980> you<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.220> got<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.550> narrow<00:01:35.880> piece<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that way you just got a narrow piece of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
that way you just got a narrow piece of

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
want to kind of cut it with a built-in

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.820 
want to kind of cut it with a built-in
spacer<00:01:40.950> at<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:42.170> quarter<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.410> inch<00:01:43.500> on

you've<00:01:53.190> already<00:01:53.310> got<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.550> built<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.940> spacer<00:01:54.360> in

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
you've already got a built in spacer in

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.300 
you've already got a built in spacer in
your<00:01:54.840> Spurs<00:01:55.320> will<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.620> spaced<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> little

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
your Spurs will be spaced a little

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.790 
your Spurs will be spaced a little
further<00:01:56.460> apart<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.660> this<00:01:58.230> case<00:01:58.440> we're<00:01:58.620> just

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
further apart so in this case we're just

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.970 
further apart so in this case we're just
going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.980> go<00:01:59.100> ahead<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.460> we're<00:01:59.970> going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.150> add

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
going to go ahead and we're going to add

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.270 
going to go ahead and we're going to add
a<00:02:01.980> bead<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.910> bone<00:02:03.210> bead<00:02:03.510> or<00:02:04.440> something<00:02:04.800> later<00:02:05.040> so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
a bead a bone bead or something later so

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
a bead a bone bead or something later so
we're<00:02:05.400> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.580> cut<00:02:05.760> them<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.090> we're

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
we're going to cut them there we're

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.610 
we're going to cut them there we're
