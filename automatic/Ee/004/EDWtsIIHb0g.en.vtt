temporary settlement they're trained to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.680 
temporary settlement they're trained to
assimilate<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> small<00:01:00.030> before<00:01:00.390> they're<00:01:00.539> 18

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
assimilate the small before they're 18

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.260 
assimilate the small before they're 18
anything<00:01:02.930> yeah<00:01:03.930> yeah<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> remember

anything yeah yeah I remember
and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.630> develop<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.409> standard

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and then they develop a standard

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.690 
and then they develop a standard
invierno<00:01:08.100> bus<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> rhythm<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> Santos

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700

it<00:01:24.000> would<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:25.080> under<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.560> patch<00:01:25.950> in

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
it would just make under a patch in

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.240 
it would just make under a patch in
there

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
there

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.120

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
so we should bridges is nowhere it it

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.360 
so we should bridges is nowhere it it
what<00:01:37.690> what<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.080> bridge<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.590> wear<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:39.130> which

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
what what this bridge to wear this which

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.420 
what what this bridge to wear this which
come<00:01:39.640> free<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.060> bomb
