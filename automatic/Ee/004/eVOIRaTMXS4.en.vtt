00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.720
 Speak galaxy cifraclub 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.610
 blanks of the show itself in the version 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.560
 simplified music do not look back 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.300
 of initial capital band 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.040
 I'll start playing the whole song. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.040
 then I'll show the chords the rhythm 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.640
 not everything 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 You want not everything can be perfect. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:06.320
 It can be easy if you 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.890
 see the world in another way 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.210
 I know what's going on, things turned out right. 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.210
 are related 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.310
 Yes, intelligence said that it was so blind. 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310
 information 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:34.500
 if it does not make sense the sport com mir 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.500
 it's nothing much 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.170
 are past waters 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.170
 choose a magistrate 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.480
 do not look at the parana 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:08.700
 I know you will find the internal solution 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:12.739
 it is a exist to worry too much 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.739
 each choice a dilemma 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.360
 I'm always on your side, but you? 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.160
 go straight and do not look for the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.160
 to lose 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.360
 if it does not make sense to scott polish 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.360
 it's nothing much 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.280
 with past water and simulate a road 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:52.780
 again 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.550
 a year behind 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.140
 good in music we're all going to use these 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.140
 chords the greater sun 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:09.870
 hello smaller with seven goals and better concedes 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.870
 the greatest gift 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.250
 or only with room with bass in it 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.100
 and that's it now let's go to the rhythm 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 we started with two down two 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.600
 up and one down 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.239
 once again 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.640
 and then we'll play four times 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.640
 a little faster 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.709
 switching to the bottom up 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.650
 so look, this is going to stay here 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.120
 We'll use this rhythm to the whole song. 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.920
 good guys now cool back the video there 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.719
 in the beginning playing music all together with me 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.980
 I hope you have learned and 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.750
