00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
places that we as civilians either kill

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.080 
places that we as civilians either kill
or<00:03:01.390> mute<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.230> these<00:03:02.890> exercises<00:03:03.520> are<00:03:03.760> really

or mute and these exercises are really

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.220 
or mute and these exercises are really
ways<00:03:04.240> of<00:03:04.450> getting<00:03:04.660> into<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.930> subconscious

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
ways of getting into the subconscious

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.340 
ways of getting into the subconscious
getting<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.670> trusting<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.540> parts<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.230> us

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
getting and trusting the parts of us

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.199 
getting and trusting the parts of us
that<00:03:08.380> really<00:03:08.770> make<00:03:08.950> us<00:03:09.100> artists<00:03:09.670> what<00:03:10.180> are

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
that really make us artists what are

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.150 
that really make us artists what are
common<00:03:10.660> mistakes<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.170> most<00:03:11.350> writers<00:03:11.800> make

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
common mistakes that most writers make

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.760 
common mistakes that most writers make
so<00:03:12.490> one<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.030> mistakes<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.540> I've<00:03:14.410> just

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
so one of the mistakes is I've just

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.220 
so one of the mistakes is I've just
trying<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.160> make<00:03:15.430> something<00:03:15.790> too<00:03:16.300> perfect

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
trying to make something too perfect

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.530 
trying to make something too perfect
because<00:03:17.920> we<00:03:18.280> want<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.550> avoid<00:03:18.790> criticism<00:03:19.300> we

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
because we want to avoid criticism we

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.120 
because we want to avoid criticism we
want<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.810> avoid<00:03:20.050> humiliation<00:03:20.380> putting

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
want to avoid humiliation putting
