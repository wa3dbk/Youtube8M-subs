 to a toy called gator 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.189
 secret that is the secret of the alligator so 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 I understand yes, that is the essence of the game 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 play completely stupid completely 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.940
 because of her stupidity like that well 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.489
 originality principle is small 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 the essence is shorter here 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.700
 let's say there is a game critic alligator 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.309
 yes so invited and here we have 2 such 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.860
 here are two circles that years blue circle and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.609
 red circle roughly 7 groats under 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.859
 some genres of games of one kind in red 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.140
 circle getting so understand such but more 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.600
 worst games at the intersection between 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.210
 red and blue games and understand 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.790
 get the coolest games and here we are 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.100
 Now take these here are the most gaming machines 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.490
 dates are drawn on top as it is called 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.869
 a game 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.420
 for example , this toy is called 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.630
 kindle there it become them contest 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 this toy you considered 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.450
 lemonade is shorter blah blah and all these games 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.009
 machines we need to push in different places 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.900
 and our alligators will talk 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.880
 whether we did well or not well 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.030
 take for example this one this one 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.720
 Clap is some kind of machine set 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.820
 its here is not correct fox you and 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.070
 have you get fired shorter than sb choosing this 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.579
 will only be right 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.290
 maybe it's a cool game 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.040
 if the floor is higher you come here it will be 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.100
 sucks wrong here wrong 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.840
 also 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.549
 tables zadolbal 2 h in short it is necessary 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.159
 generally make out that is it is all garbage 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.009
 this is not a game you understand it even 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:12.959
 not a game and so understand these and this is 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.760
 right wrong here wrong right 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:23.910
 talking about here 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:26.310
 correctly says so which are shorter than you 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.800
 I understand what game decides for me 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.420
 good what no you know what the essence of 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.620
 Basically , I understand this game, she 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.660
 created specifically to show 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.700
 how hard it is for journalists sometimes 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.739
 describe games do reviews 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.800
 for example you play this game which 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.900
 you really like for example yes but it 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.450
 The author of this game did not pay for example 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.880
 unto you for you to do good 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.040
 the game is definitely not for you but your boss in 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.580
 that you do not write some nasty or 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.760
 vice versa 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.760
 player it sucks but you got paid for 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.890
 she therefore has to praise and 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.420
 be silent about her bad side ie in 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.370
 this and the whole game this alligator on 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.560
 symbolizes and understood your boss that 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.500
 or who just got paid 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.110
 let's see no journalism freedom no 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.370
 freedom of speech I have all been written and all 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.590
 knurled on articles 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.120
 that is all the same here is a glossy magazine 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.019
 checks 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 gaming different reviews there gaming sites 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.720
 They are Elena, well, on the idea of this game, until not 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.640
 corrupt that is, in this regard, the meaning of the game 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.319
 well wrong 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.900
 I like games and I want her 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.360
 there was a wide bar on swearing 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.489
 too wrong zadolbala here and this 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.530
 In short, the garbage on his agate burns that 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.269
 this advice is not worth our attention on 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.700
 in fact, they simply did not pay for it. 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.799
 review but also wrong here this one 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.829

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.459
