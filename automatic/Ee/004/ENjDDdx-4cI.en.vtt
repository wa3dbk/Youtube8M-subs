00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.150
 the car was good 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.809
 and friends who play here is the player 10 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.110
 Uncle, I'm here today to talk about 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.930
 a game here that came out on xbox live and 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.809
 soon to be available for pc 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.220
 The name of the game is max hoff de ninja mas 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.899
 I'm going to leave my assistant here. 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.440
 talk to you how do you pronounce it 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.680
 there in mind is that brands then this 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.420
 The way this game is said, I will. 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.210
 make a weapon 'quick analysis of what is 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.119
 this game and then you take a look and 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.630
 the end of the video zinho and gives the action 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.060
 OK 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.820
 Despite being an arcade game this game 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.340
 he surprised me a lot because he 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.259
 nery is not a little game 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.090
 is something that was done in flash there 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.979
 it does not mean it's not any of it 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.289
 and I was giving a 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.940
 researched I found by chance the game 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.069
 I got interested 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.409
 I 'll go download and I'll veto the version 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.200
 that you are watching video there is a 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.410
 demo version is not sure if you guys 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.229
 like the current ifaw 11 game lawsuit 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.840
 I'll do it, okay? I'll buy it. 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.000
 We play games together. 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.910
 it depends on your acceptance there beauty 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.819
 I 'll summarize the story there is the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.800
 next mike's off the ninja mike is 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.920
 As my assistant says , it's the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.640
 next is the story of a ninja is that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.599
 it has to that you have to protect a 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.860
 clan that is in danger of extinction 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.770
 and there you are summoned to is to prevent 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 this clan is either extinct that does not exist 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.190
 more 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.700
 And then you have these tattoos and you have 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.220
 ninja skill you have among others 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.700
 several factors so absurd things that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.239
 help you in building the game and in 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.280
 building your being a ninja is so 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:42.819
 It's bad in the game here you sneak through 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.299
 through the shadows to end up stabbing 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.599
 your enemies neither by the back you hunt 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.379
 your enemies silently without being 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.580
 visa 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.770
 you must 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.350
 imagine if the game despite being he 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.890
 look for creativity in the house whether 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.140
 you have to be creative for a 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.600
 various traps various forms of killing 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.910
 enemies because there are several 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.430
 quest that are made in the game is not a 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.970
 it's up to you to end up having a 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.110
 killing anyone is a phase is to make a 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.100
 phase without being detected 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.610
 then all these are all these items 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.500
 all accessories let's say so 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:31.300
 end up creating a game in this 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.580
 stealth type an absurd quality is not it 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.959
 considering that an arcade is a price 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.950
 Yes, it's too much 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.200
 The hero is he ends up receiving 15 soon in the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.730
 beginning of the game you are passed to 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.530
 inside a tutorial for you to learn 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.290
 to play right 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.470
 as soon as you get a sword 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.770
 you receive dry bamboo data in this 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.280
 moment of distraction the attack item is 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.930
 the ninja you have just been updated or 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.980
 unlocking different movements 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.220
 offensive 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.170
 there are passive skills items you can 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.900
 grab one you can pick up a hook that 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.690
 you win is for predetermined points 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.150
 and can climb walls you can hang 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.430
 in the ceiling they hide in closets and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.400
 eventually end up teleporting 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.280
 behind the enemy of ascension using 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.010
 these tools you 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.180
 How do you say you will know the 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.580
 mind you will pass all 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.260
 obstacles of the game and thus of several 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.700
 ways you can spend even 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.650
 of you just passing the same 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.410
 process several ways right 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.900
 for example in a single situation you 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.380
 you can go after the sewers and 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.220
 down the sewers is not killing the guards 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.169
 undetected or is to use a switch from 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.870
 hallucinogen to let the guard all 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.180
 crazy and ends up taking a friend of him I go 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.340
 end up in a trap where the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.760
 two-way means of meeting and 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:03.040
 end up being caught by this trap, right? 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.830
 so you are the game is very good to play 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:11.290
 I had an absurd desire to 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:13.000
 buy the game is the game is all in 2d 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.220
 So you have that moment of 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.200
 nostalgia that we actually games 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:23.320
 that you've been playing for a while, right? 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:28.479
 so the art of the game is very good, I 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.419
 I think it's really cool, so it's a game. 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.850
 in itself is very good, what happens to 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.919
 Sometimes you just get frustrated in 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.450
 to the controls of the game, right? 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.460
 an example is putting somewhere goes to 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.580
 somewhere and ends up hurt and not 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.260
 I wanted the one to stick in that place. 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.930
 for example one for you if you 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.490
 example you have some controls that are 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.640
 sensitive to the context of the game eg 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.229
 you press b lets you grab 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.410
 a dead guard you can choose the 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.940
 dude nÃ© but b is also a button for 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.950
 you hide 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.300
 so if you killed that guy next to 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.190
 a place that you hide 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.479
 If you need to respond soon in the 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.229
 sequence also because no other 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.330
 guard 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.220
 you press b or you ask yourself if 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.200
 hides this is a bit confusing but 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.690
 so and rarely fatal 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.430
 so this problem in the difficult will not 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:21.960
 our cause that disorder on 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:26.680
 understood about this, I did. 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.720
 A beautiful one about the game is a mmo in the game 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.360
 he has five hours of vigo 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.520
 so eventually you have 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.020
 eventually not constantly you 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.479
 will always end up producing a new 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.099
 some feature a new weapon 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:40.150
 some new enemy the enemy more 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:42.819
 difficult 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.539
 anyway the game is renewing itself then 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:49.360
 You just do not get sick of the game. 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:52.270
 during this period of five hours outside 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.240
 remember that the game he had several 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:07:00.159
 new site high notes analysis of 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.770
 games is like yoga game for example the 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:06.669
 game that's right 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.440
 there the gamer is among other sites will 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:11.889
 so I will remember everyone now receiving 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.380
 a good grade in the assessment and then 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.479
 you have the opportunity to play on 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.789
 the xbox is very cool game take a look 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.979
 do not check what I've created soon 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:23.949
 he will be extinct then he will also 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.909
 pc is exclusively for pc and xboxon except 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.840
 that ps3 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:33.580
 Okay, so stay in a bar. 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:36.639
 beauty discusses there if they liked our 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.710
 video of that favorite joinha if you 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.960
 do not think that our channel still 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.419
 inscribes that it helps people a lot by 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.229
 here beauty and I 'm not going to stay here 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:48.120
 guys 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:48.120
 until the next shaw
