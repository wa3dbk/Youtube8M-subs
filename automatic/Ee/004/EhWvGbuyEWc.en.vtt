up and using it in my art journal so

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.009 
up and using it in my art journal so
this<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.889> something<00:04:13.190> else<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.459> I<00:04:13.549> recommend

and then once enough pages are ripped
out<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:16.849> think<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.209> might<00:04:17.359> actually<00:04:17.510> turn<00:04:17.930> this

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.140 
out I think I might actually turn this
book<00:04:18.650> itself<00:04:19.039> do<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.489> an<00:04:19.609> altered<00:04:19.909> book

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
book itself do like an altered book

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.990 
book itself do like an altered book
project<00:04:20.599> and<00:04:20.780> turn<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.739> into<00:04:21.919> an<00:04:22.669> art<00:04:22.909> journal

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
project and turn it into an art journal

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.490 
project and turn it into an art journal
itself

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.670 

so<00:04:27.500> that's<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.860> these<00:04:28.280> are<00:04:28.640> my<00:04:29.650> three<00:04:30.650> most
