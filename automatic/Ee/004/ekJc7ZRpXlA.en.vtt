I i had i faded the knicks and they

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.340 
I i had i faded the knicks and they
played<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.360> best<00:04:28.570> half<00:04:28.780> I've<00:04:28.960> ever<00:04:29.110> seen

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
played the best half I've ever seen

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.590 
played the best half I've ever seen
against<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.770> heat<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.700> terrible<00:04:31.090> half<00:04:31.360> and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
against the heat and a terrible half and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.390 
against the heat and a terrible half and
then<00:04:31.660> another<00:04:31.960> terrible<00:04:32.410> half<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.860> then<00:04:33.250> they

then another terrible half and then they

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.190 
then another terrible half and then they
played<00:04:33.610> great<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.540> think<00:04:34.570> maybe<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.050> best

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
played great and I think maybe the best

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.600 
played great and I think maybe the best
thing<00:04:35.290> that<00:04:35.530> happens<00:04:35.860> with<00:04:36.010> what<00:04:36.130> your<00:04:36.250> sports

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
thing that happens with what your sports

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.550 
thing that happens with what your sports
options<00:04:36.940> are<00:04:37.060> Don<00:04:37.270> best<00:04:37.540> screens<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.140> we<00:04:38.380> hear

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
options are Don best screens and we hear

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.040

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
Carmelo Anthony's reported out and then

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.780 
Carmelo Anthony's reported out and then
let<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.410> line<00:04:41.590> move<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.010> point<00:04:42.280> maybe<00:04:42.550> that's

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
let the line move a point maybe that's

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.000 
let the line move a point maybe that's
what<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.030> look<00:04:43.330> for<00:04:43.360> that<00:04:43.810> that's<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.230> vent<00:04:44.470> or

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
what I look for that that's a vent or

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.760 
what I look for that that's a vent or
especially<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.000> NBA<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.770> more

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
especially in the NBA and more

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.500 
especially in the NBA and more
importantly<00:04:48.160> when<00:04:48.340> it's<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.550> marquee<00:04:49.180> game<00:04:49.480> a

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
importantly when it's a marquee game a

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.210 
importantly when it's a marquee game a
prime-time<00:04:49.990> game<00:04:50.260> that's<00:04:50.650> going<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.860> attract

don't know what Nick teams going to show
up<00:05:28.390> from<00:05:28.630> one<00:05:28.840> half<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.410> other<00:05:29.590> let<00:05:29.830> alone

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
up from one half to the other let alone

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.640 
up from one half to the other let alone
one<00:05:30.250> quarter<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:30.820> next<00:05:31.300> but<00:05:31.750> I<00:05:32.020> think<00:05:32.530> it's

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
one quarter to the next but I think it's

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.900 
one quarter to the next but I think it's
a<00:05:32.680> good<00:05:32.800> spot<00:05:33.070> for<00:05:33.130> them<00:05:33.370> when<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.580> look<00:05:33.730> at

a good spot for them when you look at

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.990 
a good spot for them when you look at
Oklahoma<00:05:34.419> City<00:05:34.720> not<00:05:35.290> a<00:05:35.320> deep<00:05:35.800> team<00:05:36.130> they<00:05:36.820> only

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
Oklahoma City not a deep team they only

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.610 
Oklahoma City not a deep team they only
go<00:05:37.240> about<00:05:37.390> six<00:05:37.870> deep<00:05:38.140> and<00:05:38.350> they've<00:05:38.440> had<00:05:38.560> a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
go about six deep and they've had a

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.550 
go about six deep and they've had a
really<00:05:39.010> tough<00:05:39.190> schedule<00:05:39.910> here<00:05:40.180> of<00:05:40.300> late<00:05:40.540> if<00:05:40.810> we

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
really tough schedule here of late if we

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.890 
really tough schedule here of late if we
could<00:05:41.740> get<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.130> star<00:05:42.460> player<00:05:42.700> missing<00:05:43.450> theory

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
could get the star player missing theory

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.050 
could get the star player missing theory
in<00:05:44.020> effect<00:05:44.380> and<00:05:44.620> create<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.400> perfect<00:05:45.610> storm

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
for line value as well I think the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.950 
for line value as well I think the
Knicks<00:05:48.340> of<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.520> right<00:05:48.730> side<00:05:49.060> so<00:05:49.360> give<00:05:49.810> me<00:05:49.840> the
