00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hey guys welcome to the fix the lab hope

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.950 
hey guys welcome to the fix the lab hope
your<00:00:04.950> day<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.069> going<00:00:05.190> well<00:00:05.640> I'm<00:00:06.600> going<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.839> show

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
your day is going well I'm going to show

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.480 
your day is going well I'm going to show
you<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.109> quick<00:00:07.290> technique<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:07.980> how<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> add

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
you a quick technique on how to add

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.450 
you a quick technique on how to add
random<00:00:08.940> colors<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.510> your<00:00:09.630> clones<00:00:10.099> so<00:00:11.099> let's<00:00:11.309> go

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
random colors to your clones so let's go

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.070 
random colors to your clones so let's go
ahead<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.670> get<00:00:11.940> started<00:00:12.120> by<00:00:12.509> making<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.929> new

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
ahead and get started by making a new

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.650 
ahead and get started by making a new
texture<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.799> go<00:00:14.790> ahead<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.089> look<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
texture and go ahead and look in the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.680 
texture and go ahead and look in the
color<00:00:15.990> channel<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.830> roll<00:00:17.730> down<00:00:17.910> texture<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
color channel and roll down texture and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.400 
color channel and roll down texture and
go<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> mograph<00:00:19.470> color<00:00:20.310> shader<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:22.050> when<00:00:22.320> you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
go to mograph color shader and when you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.160 
go to mograph color shader and when you
load<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:23.090> you<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.240> actually<00:00:24.510> pick<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> color

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
load that you can actually pick a color

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.870 
load that you can actually pick a color
where<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.619> gonna<00:00:25.800> start<00:00:26.250> off<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.760> we'll

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
where it's gonna start off at so we'll

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.509 
where it's gonna start off at so we'll
just<00:00:27.060> pick<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.599> bright<00:00:27.869> red<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.160> notice

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
just pick a bright red now you notice

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.189 
just pick a bright red now you notice
that<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.789> doesn't<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.269> show<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:30.929> red

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that it doesn't actually show up as red

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
that it doesn't actually show up as red
we're<00:00:31.890> gonna<00:00:32.040> go<00:00:32.099> ahead<00:00:32.189> take<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.640> texture

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
we're gonna go ahead take this texture

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.600 
we're gonna go ahead take this texture
and<00:00:33.210> put<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.480> our<00:00:33.540> cloner<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:35.399> looks

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and put it on our cloner and it looks

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.889 
and put it on our cloner and it looks
like<00:00:35.700> something<00:00:36.030> happened<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
like something happened but if you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.160 
like something happened but if you
render<00:00:37.610> nothing's<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.390> that's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
render nothing's really there that's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.020 
render nothing's really there that's
because<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.800> order<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> use<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.820> need<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
because in order to use this you need a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.709 
because in order to use this you need a
random<00:00:42.329> effector<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:45.000> ahead<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.570> into

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
random effector so go ahead and go into

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.440 
random effector so go ahead and go into
your<00:00:45.840> effectors<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.879> hold<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.000> alt<00:00:48.270> or

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
your effectors and hold down alt or

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.799 
your effectors and hold down alt or
option<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.140> click<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.860> random<00:00:50.129> effector<00:00:50.809> now

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
option and click on random effector now

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
option and click on random effector now
you<00:00:51.870> need<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.320> into<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.649> random<00:00:53.100> effector

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you need to go into your random effector

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.470 
you need to go into your random effector
and<00:00:54.110> right<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.500> color<00:00:55.829> mode<00:00:56.129> it's

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
and right here in color mode it's

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.549 
and right here in color mode it's
defaulted<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> off<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> turn<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
defaulted to off you have to turn that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.880 
defaulted to off you have to turn that
on<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.480> when<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.660> turned<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.710> hit

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
on and when that's turned on and you hit

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
on and when that's turned on and you hit
render<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.390> there's<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.870> your

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
render there you go there's all your

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.789 
render there you go there's all your
sweet<00:01:04.769> random<00:01:05.250> colors<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> say<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.710> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
sweet random colors so say that you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.170 
sweet random colors so say that you
don't<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> full<00:01:08.520> spectrum<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
don't want the full spectrum of the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.270 
don't want the full spectrum of the
rainbow<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.080> want<00:01:10.320> them<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.950> sort

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
rainbow right you want them to be sort

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.300 
rainbow right you want them to be sort
of<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.750> mostly<00:01:13.229> reds<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.799> oranges<00:01:13.830> or

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
of in you know mostly reds or oranges or

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
of in you know mostly reds or oranges or
yellows<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.049> in

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
yellows the way that you do that is in

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.130 
yellows the way that you do that is in
this<00:01:16.439> mixed<00:01:16.890> strength<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.990> at

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this mixed strength so right now it's at

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.660 
this mixed strength so right now it's at
a<00:01:19.170> hundred<00:01:19.380> percent<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> turn<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.340> down

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a hundred percent if you turn that down

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.990 
a hundred percent if you turn that down
to<00:01:20.820> zero<00:01:21.290> everything<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to zero everything is going to be the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
to zero everything is going to be the
default<00:01:24.689> color<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> picked<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.920> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
default color that you picked up here so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
default color that you picked up here so
that's<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.729> bright<00:01:27.030> red<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:28.259> want<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that's that bright red if we want it to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
that's that bright red if we want it to
be<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> family<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> red<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.540> bit

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
be in the family of red but a little bit

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.569 
be in the family of red but a little bit
of<00:01:30.810> variation<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.500> kick<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.100> mixed

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
of variation you can kick this mixed

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.510 
of variation you can kick this mixed
strength<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.990> render<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.400> can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
strength up then render and now you can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.950 
strength up then render and now you can
see<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.820> getting<00:01:35.939> some<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
see you're getting some kind of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.859 
see you're getting some kind of
variations<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.950> color<00:01:38.479> if<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.600> make<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
variations of that color if we make that

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
variations of that color if we make that
a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.140> bit<00:01:40.350> more<00:01:40.530> dramatic<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.220> see

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
a little bit more dramatic you can see

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
a little bit more dramatic you can see
you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.689> we're<00:01:42.869> adding<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.530> more

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you know we're adding a little bit more

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
you know we're adding a little bit more
variation<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> mix<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.990> keep

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
variation into the mix and you can keep

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.389 
variation into the mix and you can keep
doing<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.829> up<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> point

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
doing that all the way up to the point

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.969 
doing that all the way up to the point
where<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.729> completely<00:01:48.240> different<00:01:48.540> colors

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
where it's completely different colors

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.249 
where it's completely different colors
so<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.399> kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> fun<00:01:50.909> technique

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
so that's it kind of a fun technique

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.780 
so that's it kind of a fun technique
just<00:01:52.259> remember<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.860> make<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> cloner<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
just remember if you make a cloner and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.819 
just remember if you make a cloner and
nothing<00:01:54.270> happens<00:01:54.630> remember<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> need<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.619> put

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
nothing happens remember you need to put

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.920 
nothing happens remember you need to put
it<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.159> random<00:01:56.340> effector<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it in a random effector go into the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
it in a random effector go into the
random<00:01:58.200> effector<00:01:58.560> turn<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> color<00:01:59.250> mode<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
random effector turn the color mode to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.300 
random effector turn the color mode to
on<00:01:59.850> otherwise<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.020> won't<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.350> anything<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
on otherwise you won't see anything so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.950 
on otherwise you won't see anything so
