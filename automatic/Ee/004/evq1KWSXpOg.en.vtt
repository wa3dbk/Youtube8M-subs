in shame we fly in a few times I've been

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.370 
in shame we fly in a few times I've been
fortunate<00:01:14.740> enough<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.130> beat<00:01:15.369> him<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.670> few<00:01:16.060> times

fortunate enough to beat him a few times

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.510 
fortunate enough to beat him a few times
one<00:01:17.380> time<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:17.619> think<00:01:17.950> I'd<00:01:18.070> be<00:01:18.159> here<00:01:18.189> about<00:01:18.340> of

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
one time I think I'd be here about of

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480 
one time I think I'd be here about of
20,000<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.590> another<00:01:20.590> time<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.010> beat<00:01:21.189> him<00:01:21.280> out<00:01:21.460> a

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
20,000 and another time I beat him out a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.700 
20,000 and another time I beat him out a
little<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.970> little<00:01:22.299> money<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.869> another<00:01:23.409> time

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
little a little money and another time

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.820 
little a little money and another time
but<00:01:24.070> in<00:01:24.880> my<00:01:25.509> opinion<00:01:25.630> he's<00:01:26.020> probably<00:01:26.409> one<00:01:26.799> of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
but in my opinion he's probably one of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.649 
but in my opinion he's probably one of
the<00:01:26.920> greatest<00:01:26.950> bar<00:01:27.430> table<00:01:27.729> players<00:01:27.970> on<00:01:28.540> the

one pocket there that's what I've known
for<00:02:09.940> your<00:02:10.390> height<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.430> think<00:02:12.670> maybe<00:02:12.820> in

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
for your height do you think maybe in

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.370 
for your height do you think maybe in
one<00:02:13.239> pocket<00:02:13.450> where<00:02:13.840> you're<00:02:13.870> playing<00:02:14.200> with

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
one pocket where you're playing with

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.130 
one pocket where you're playing with
clusters<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.100> your<00:02:15.220> plan<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.700> half<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.630> table

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
clusters and your plan on half the table

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.050 
clusters and your plan on half the table
most<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.680> time<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.190> mean<00:02:18.580> does<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.730> give

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
most of the time I mean does that give

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.940 
most of the time I mean does that give
you<00:02:19.209> an<00:02:19.330> edge<00:02:19.570> when<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.840> comes<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.230> bar<00:02:20.410> box<00:02:20.650> I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
you an edge when it comes to bar box I

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.410 
you an edge when it comes to bar box I
never<00:02:21.220> really<00:02:21.459> thought<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.820> like<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.000> but

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
never really thought of it like that but

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.970 
never really thought of it like that but
now<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.140> bring<00:02:23.350> up<00:02:23.530> makes<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.830> lot<00:02:23.950> of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
now that you bring up makes a lot of

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.800 
now that you bring up makes a lot of
sense<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.519> tighter<00:02:24.760> area<00:02:25.060> you're<00:02:25.780> working

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
sense it's a tighter area you're working

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.710 
sense it's a tighter area you're working
with<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.230> lot<00:02:26.440> less<00:02:26.470> space<00:02:27.480> makes<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.600> lot<00:02:28.690> of

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
with a lot less space makes a lot of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.050 
with a lot less space makes a lot of
sense<00:02:28.870> maybe<00:02:29.290> that's<00:02:29.680> why<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.890> sell<00:02:30.580> on<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.880> bar

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
sense maybe that's why I sell on the bar

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.300 
sense maybe that's why I sell on the bar
table<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.630> grew<00:02:32.260> up<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.590> bar<00:02:32.769> table<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
table I grew up on the bar table so I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.729 
table I grew up on the bar table so I
feel<00:02:33.550> real<00:02:33.760> confident<00:02:34.269> they're<00:02:34.739> switching

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
feel real confident they're switching

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.259 
feel real confident they're switching
from<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.040> pocket<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.640> 9-ball<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.120> 10-ball

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
from one pocket to 9-ball and 10-ball

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.030 
from one pocket to 9-ball and 10-ball
the<00:02:37.690> big<00:02:37.900> table<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> lot<00:02:38.470> tougher<00:02:38.680> than<00:02:38.829> what

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
the big table is a lot tougher than what

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.460 
the big table is a lot tougher than what
people<00:02:39.070> might<00:02:39.489> think<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.690> that's<00:02:41.200> probably

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
people might think so that's probably

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.119 
people might think so that's probably
one<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.920> my<00:02:42.010> world<00:02:42.730> champion
