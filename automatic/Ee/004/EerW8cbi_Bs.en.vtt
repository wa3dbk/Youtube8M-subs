00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
easy with leonel messy his speed

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.790 
easy with leonel messy his speed
ridiculous<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.870> said<00:02:19.110> before<00:02:19.350> he's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
ridiculous like I said before he's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.980 
ridiculous like I said before he's
almost<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:20.400> Usain<00:02:20.820> Bolt<00:02:21.150> his<00:02:21.330> acceleration

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
almost like Usain Bolt his acceleration

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.460 
almost like Usain Bolt his acceleration
to<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:22.440> up<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.740> top<00:02:22.830> speed<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.630> 90210<00:02:24.630> 93

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
to get up to the top speed of 90210 93

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.560 
to get up to the top speed of 90210 93
is<00:02:25.710> instant<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:26.910> he's<00:02:27.030> got<00:02:27.150> 99

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
is instant because he's got 99

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.420 
is instant because he's got 99
acceleration<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.710> he's<00:02:28.830> there<00:02:29.070> within<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
acceleration so he's there within the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.670 
acceleration so he's there within the
blink<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.880> an<00:02:30.030> eye<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.020> good<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.590> his

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
blink of an eye it's so good and his

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.830 
blink of an eye it's so good and his
movement<00:02:32.190> pivotal<00:02:33.030> I've<00:02:33.180> said<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.510> with

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
movement pivotal I've said this with

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.510 
movement pivotal I've said this with
many<00:02:34.020> strikers<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.680> game<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.160> his

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
many strikers on this game if his

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.730 
many strikers on this game if his
movements<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.120> good<00:02:36.330> he<00:02:36.930> will<00:02:37.260> not<00:02:37.470> score

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
movements not good he will not score

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.440 
movements not good he will not score
goals<00:02:38.040> he<00:02:38.220> won't<00:02:38.430> get<00:02:38.580> into<00:02:38.730> positions<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
goals he won't get into positions to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
goals he won't get into positions to
score<00:02:39.690> goals<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:40.230> tried<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.070> play<00:02:41.310> i

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
tried scoring a nitty-gritty kind of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.380 
tried scoring a nitty-gritty kind of
balls<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.500> box<00:02:43.890> where<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.520> testes

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
balls in the box where you testes

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.090 
balls in the box where you testes

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
movement and he's movement inside the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.490 
movement and he's movement inside the
box<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.550> great<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.270> when<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.140> ball<00:02:49.320> comes

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
box is great because when the ball comes

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500 
box is great because when the ball comes
in<00:02:49.770> like<00:02:50.070> you're<00:02:50.220> gonna<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.910> he<00:02:51.210> comes

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
alive he comes alive he gets into space

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.310 
alive he comes alive he gets into space
and<00:02:53.850> he<00:02:53.970> scores<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.480> gore<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.200> is

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
and he scores the gore because that is

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.710 
and he scores the gore because that is
what<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.620> guy<00:02:55.830> does<00:02:55.890> he<00:02:56.580> scores<00:02:57.030> goals<00:02:57.180> and

what this guy does he scores goals and
the<00:02:57.900> other<00:02:58.080> Peru<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.560> his<00:02:59.070> balance<00:02:59.460> because<00:02:59.850> he

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
the other Peru is his balance because he

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.700 
the other Peru is his balance because he
could<00:03:00.210> be<00:03:00.360> getting<00:03:00.570> pushed<00:03:00.900> off<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.110> ball<00:03:01.410> all

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.440 
could be getting pushed off the ball all
the<00:03:01.770> way<00:03:02.220> down<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.880> pitch<00:03:03.060> when<00:03:03.300> he's

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
the way down the pitch when he's

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.510 
the way down the pitch when he's
dribbling<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.960> still<00:03:04.530> hold<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> ball<00:03:05.340> and
