00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.130
 hydropower zongo ii is evolving 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.099
 normally escape me joseph state 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.619

 Sunday the construction work of 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.500
 the zongo 2 hydropower plant 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.050
 which will have an installed capacity of 150 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.140
 megawatts an energy that will benefit the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.329
 populations of the low kinshasa congo of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.010

 February on the site we are worth two 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.000
 joseph kabila was first made 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.750

 the last step 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.820
 this visit has deteriorated civil engineering 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.250
 who are suffering from eceh finish 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.329

 the evolution is good we have exceeded 40% 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.510
 work execution 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.270

 next to see this central be 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.010
 completed and injected are produced on 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.490
 snell networks longo this 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.590
 central who who will have three machines and 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.340
 that will each produce 50 megawatts 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.790
 and so the total expected 150 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.070
 megawatts 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.750
 note that before taking the road
