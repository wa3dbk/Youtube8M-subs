that<00:01:48.289> they're<00:01:48.440> on<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.039> will<00:01:49.190> let<00:01:49.520> us

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
that they're on and that will let us

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.240 
that they're on and that will let us
view<00:01:49.910> that<00:01:50.300> channel<00:01:50.690> so<00:01:51.140> we<00:01:51.440> know<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.649> we

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
view that channel so we know that we

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.449 
view that channel so we know that we
want<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.759> see<00:01:53.240> channel<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:54.160> here<00:01:55.160> so<00:01:55.340> we're

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
want to see channel one here so we're

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.430 
want to see channel one here so we're
going<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.640> select<00:01:55.759> channel<00:01:56.240> one<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.690> there's

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
going to select channel one and there's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.580 
going to select channel one and there's
channel<00:01:57.740> 1<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.599> we<00:01:59.599> know<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.869> this<00:01:59.990> video<00:02:00.349> is

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
channel 1 and we know that this video is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.680 
channel 1 and we know that this video is
actually<00:02:00.800> on<00:02:01.340> channel<00:02:01.849> 4<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:02.420> we're<00:02:02.539> going<00:02:02.630> to

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
actually on channel 4 so we're going to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.820 
actually on channel 4 so we're going to
go<00:02:02.840> channel<00:02:03.110> 4<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.720> then<00:02:05.720> before<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.649> can

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
go channel 4 and then before I can

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.850 
go channel 4 and then before I can
actually<00:02:06.920> set<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.569> director<00:02:08.989> mode

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
actually set this to the director mode

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.800 
actually set this to the director mode
that<00:02:10.459> shows<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.880> output<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.480> switching

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
that shows the output of switching

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.940 
that shows the output of switching

now let's do a little bit of directing
first<00:02:51.510> thing<00:02:51.750> first<00:02:52.670> let's<00:02:53.670> see<00:02:53.910> how<00:02:54.060> this

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
first thing first let's see how this

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:27.520 
first thing first let's see how this
looks

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.839 

there<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.620> go<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:29.010> see<00:03:29.250> each<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.519> the

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
there you go you can see each of the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.059 
there you go you can see each of the
feeds<00:03:30.590> now<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.650> want<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.280> actually<00:03:32.480> create<00:03:33.480> a

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
feeds now I want to actually create a

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.500 
feeds now I want to actually create a
directed<00:03:35.069> output<00:03:35.670> feed<00:03:35.849> here<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.299> we're<00:03:36.480> just

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
directed output feed here so we're just

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.699 
directed output feed here so we're just
going<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.780> select<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.019> channel<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
going to select the channel of the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.140 
going to select the channel of the
multicam<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.930> channel<00:03:40.380> 5<00:03:41.150> so

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
multicam so that is on channel 5 so

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.039 
multicam so that is on channel 5 so
let's<00:03:42.299> go<00:03:42.420> up<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.660> 5<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:45.750> see<00:03:45.900> nothing
