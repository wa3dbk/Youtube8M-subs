doing a review on the Louisville TPX
Omaha<00:00:05.910> it's<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.629> believe<00:00:06.750> it's<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.319> 2011<00:00:07.830> model

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
Omaha it's I believe it's the 2011 model

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.000 
Omaha it's I believe it's the 2011 model
or<00:00:09.120> 2012<00:00:09.809> model<00:00:10.139> bayit<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.769> was<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
or 2012 model bayit so this was the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.680 
or 2012 model bayit so this was the
older<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.900> I<00:00:12.900> bought<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:14.540> because<00:00:15.540> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
older one and I bought this because I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.410 
older one and I bought this because I
needed<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.080> BB<00:00:16.529> core<00:00:16.740> proofed<00:00:17.070> bath<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:18.180> new

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
needed a BB core proofed bath for my new

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.859 
needed a BB core proofed bath for my new
league<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.490> yeah<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.449> guess<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> little<00:00:21.750> bit

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
league and yeah so I guess a little bit

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.660 
league and yeah so I guess a little bit
about<00:00:22.109> myself<00:00:22.289> I'm<00:00:22.590> more<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> speed<00:00:23.220> guy<00:00:23.460> I'm

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
about myself I'm more of a speed guy I'm

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.120 
about myself I'm more of a speed guy I'm
not<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.970> power<00:00:24.240> guy<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.949> definitely<00:00:25.949> feels

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
not a power guy so this definitely feels

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.990 
not a power guy so this definitely feels
like<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.400> more<00:00:27.180> balanced<00:00:27.720> bat<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.519> know<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
like a more balanced bat I know that the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.340 
like a more balanced bat I know that the
new<00:00:30.330> version<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> Omaha<00:00:31.529> ballets

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.709 
new version of the Omaha ballets
2012/2013<00:00:35.030> feels<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> lot<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.329> lightweight

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
2012/2013 feels a lot more lightweight

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.040 
2012/2013 feels a lot more lightweight
than<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.290> does<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> say<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
than this does but I have to say that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.440 
than this does but I have to say that
I've<00:00:40.469> already<00:00:40.800> used<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.370> two<00:00:41.820> games<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
I've already used this in two games and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
I've already used this in two games and
I've<00:00:42.989> already<00:00:43.230> gotten<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:44.070> bunch<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.579> hits<00:00:44.760> out

I've already gotten a bunch of hits out
of<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.899> never<00:00:46.230> expected<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.829> myself<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> get

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of it I never expected for myself to get

of it I never expected for myself to get
I<00:00:47.879> had<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> triple<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.890> bag<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> I

need the legacy I I'm not much for for

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.880 
need the legacy I I'm not much for for
hitting<00:00:54.570> extra-base<00:00:55.020> hits<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.710> more

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
just a plain contact slot guy so I get a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
just a plain contact slot guy so I get a
lot<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> singles<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.550> yeah<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> ball<00:01:00.420> really

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
lot of singles but yeah the ball really

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
lot of singles but yeah the ball really
jumps<00:01:00.960> off<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.440> path<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.489> good

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
jumps off this path it's really good

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
jumps off this path it's really good
rather<00:01:03.120> than<00:01:03.239> anybody<00:01:03.570> that's<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.019> BSR

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
rather than anybody that's to use BSR

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.000 
rather than anybody that's to use BSR
you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.900> those<00:01:07.439> bats<00:01:07.680> used<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you know that that those bats used to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
you know that that those bats used to
have<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> ping<00:01:08.520> sound<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> knew<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
have a ping sound to it so you knew that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.280 
have a ping sound to it so you knew that
it<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.010> aluminum<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.970> opposed<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> wood<00:01:13.049> where

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it was aluminum as opposed to wood where

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.240 
it was aluminum as opposed to wood where
I<00:01:13.350> feel<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:15.110> BBCOR<00:01:16.110> bats<00:01:16.350> sound<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
I feel like a lot of BBCOR bats sound a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
I feel like a lot of BBCOR bats sound a
lot<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.640> wood<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.689> they're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
lot like wood because you know they're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.080 
lot like wood because you know they're
supposed<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.259> made<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:20.040> act<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:21.060> like

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
supposed to be made to act more like

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.749 
supposed to be made to act more like
wood<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.619> actually<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.189> mean<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> can't

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
wood but this actually I mean you can't

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
wood but this actually I mean you can't
hear<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.200> has<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
hear it with this but it has more of a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
hear it with this but it has more of a
ping<00:01:26.009> sound<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:27.030> hit<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
ping sound to it and you do hit that

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.649 
ping sound to it and you do hit that
what<00:01:28.049> people<00:01:28.350> complain<00:01:28.680> about<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.390> grip<00:01:30.390> tape

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
what people complain about the grip tape

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
what people complain about the grip tape
I<00:01:30.810> guess<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.290> along<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.500> bat<00:01:31.799> itself<00:01:32.310> but

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
I guess that's along the bat itself but

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.429 
I guess that's along the bat itself but
mine<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.210> sort<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.810> falling<00:01:34.020> apart<00:01:34.380> blood

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
mine is sort of falling apart blood

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.810 
mine is sort of falling apart blood
you<00:01:35.619> know<00:01:35.710> it's<00:01:36.100> all<00:01:36.219> personal<00:01:36.460> preference

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
you know it's all personal preference

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.300 
you know it's all personal preference
how<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.149> use<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.780> lot<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.109> white<00:01:38.289> guys<00:01:38.469> my

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
how you use it a lot of white guys my

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.370 
how you use it a lot of white guys my
teammates<00:01:39.640> use<00:01:39.789> pine<00:01:40.030> tar<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:40.539> they<00:01:41.020> retake

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
teammates use pine tar and they retake

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.649 
teammates use pine tar and they retake
their<00:01:41.560> bats<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.979> whatnot<00:01:42.219> but<00:01:42.630> yeah<00:01:43.630> I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
their bats and whatnot but yeah I

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:44.969 
their bats and whatnot but yeah I
probably<00:01:43.840> won't<00:01:44.079> be<00:01:44.200> retaking<00:01:44.619> this<00:01:44.770> for<00:01:44.950> a

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
probably won't be retaking this for a

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.380 
probably won't be retaking this for a
while<00:01:45.130> if<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.549> have<00:01:45.670> any<00:01:45.819> other<00:01:45.939> questions
