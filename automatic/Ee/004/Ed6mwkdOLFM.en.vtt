going to wear liquid foundation it
covers<00:01:08.580> beautifully<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> skin

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
covers beautifully I think on the skin

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160 
covers beautifully I think on the skin
it<00:01:10.290> blends<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:11.159> well<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.689> stays<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it blends really well and it stays a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
it blends really well and it stays a
long<00:01:13.590> time<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.210> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
long time so I just think that it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.580 
long time so I just think that it's
really<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.320> definitely

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
really good and I would definitely

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.030 
really good and I would definitely

and i use this not only last year but

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
and i use this not only last year but
the<00:01:30.000> year<00:01:30.030> before<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.540> 2012<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:32.009> i

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the year before that 2012 is when i

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
the year before that 2012 is when i
discovered<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.659> been<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> favorite

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
discovered it so it's been a favorite

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890 
discovered it so it's been a favorite
for<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.920> long<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.280> i<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
for a very long time i think that it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840 
for a very long time i think that it
covers<00:01:37.140> nicely<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.890> skin<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> need

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
covers nicely on the skin if you need

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.080 
covers nicely on the skin if you need
light<00:01:39.150> coverage<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.650> also<00:01:40.979> feels<00:01:41.460> really

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
light coverage but it also feels really

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.679 
light coverage but it also feels really
light<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.530> looks<00:01:43.890> natural<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.670> i<00:01:44.909> always

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
light and it looks natural so i always

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
light and it looks natural so i always
go<00:01:46.320> back<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.369> continue<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
go back to this and I will continue to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's great to set foundation or just

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.380 
it's great to set foundation or just
concealer<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> use

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
concealer if that's what you want to use

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
concealer if that's what you want to use
it<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:01.140> will<00:02:01.320> keep<00:02:01.590> your<00:02:01.799> skin<00:02:02.100> Matt<00:02:02.369> but

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it really will keep your skin Matt but

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.580 
it really will keep your skin Matt but
it<00:02:03.090> also<00:02:03.270> doesn't<00:02:03.719> look<00:02:03.840> heavy<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> skin<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it also doesn't look heavy on the skin I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.980 
it also doesn't look heavy on the skin I
think<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.040> still<00:02:05.340> looks<00:02:05.640> pretty<00:02:05.759> natural<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.750> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
think it still looks pretty natural so I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.499 
think it still looks pretty natural so I
will<00:02:07.710> also<00:02:08.250> continue<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> always<00:02:09.149> go<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.450> to
