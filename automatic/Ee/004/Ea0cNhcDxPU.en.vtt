00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello everyone welcome to lethal 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.040
 crisis' today I'll talk to you in the video 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.480
 of a kind of legend to call it 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 so that you can not double a 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.740
 folio more than seven times in half I 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.630
 I have the folio already with some folds 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.720
 to make it easier now in the video 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.449
 go doing it 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.990
 but first I'll talk a little about 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.990
 this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.570
 and good 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.310
 among urban legends there is one that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.810
 has some foundation is about 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.510
 be that you can not bend a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.150
 paper more than seven times in half in 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.160
 really yes you can but as I have 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.010
 said has some foundation that 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.570
 statement that normally denies it 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.640
 usually say that it does not depend on the size 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.300
 of the paper but it does depend on some 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.920
 measure 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.350
 ah yes it is true that you can double a 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.360
 limited number of times and always 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.059
 depending on the efforts we can 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.620
 realize it should be noted that every time 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.899
 doubles the paper doubles the number 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.489
 of layers to bend this means that 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.280
 we doubled your paper a number 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.170
 determined times to interest that 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.420
 let's go double in half 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.050
 will have to double that number of times by 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.200
 2 folding a paper eight times would equal 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.470
 to fold a book to fold a book of 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.880
 128 pages which is not easy and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.250
 well as I always say the best is 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.830
 do it but before you can say some 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 data more double a sheet more than 8 times 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.320
 by hand it is practically impossible 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.100
 double it more than 8 times would be equivalent to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.310
 fold a 256-page book by the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.310
 half 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.200
 now there are extrafine roles created in 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.690
 the last extrafine generations that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 you can fold I do not know if more than eight 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.400
 times but until eight o'clock or so 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.020
 could do more than seven times but with 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.960
 a folio that is the role that all 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.850
 we have at home you will see how almost no 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.990
 it can be done seven times 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.310
 you are going to see what is 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:11.350
 then doubled and now we do it for 2 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:15.160
 4 for 2 8 for 2 16 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.900
 32 and this is what I meant when 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.310
 you have to multiply by two 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.420
 every time we go folding 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 and how are you going to see 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.830
 a fold 2 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020
 Four. Five 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.130
 and now you're going to see that you can hardly 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.130
 do not even 7 fold already bad but 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.050
 good 7 times you see that we have folded 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.140
 in half seven times but it 's 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.100
 totally impossible with a folio 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.470
 fold it more than seven times 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.330
 this was what I meant with that 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.020
 legend has some foundation with a 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.370
 normal paper as you see by a lot of force 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.340
 what he wants to do is totally impossible 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.460
 give it one more bend to this you see that it is 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.400
 already very fat 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.140
 but as I said with the extra papers 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.140
 fine that have been created lately or 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.110
 with a piece of something other than paper 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.180
 but that can be folded in half 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.490
 Well, maybe it can be done but good 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.700
 as you have seen it is impossible to bend it 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.790
 more than seven times with a folio but 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.030
 Well what I said if you have any paper 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.350
 special for this this statement is already 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.430
 break 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.159
 but as he finished teaching 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.959
 a paper a sheet in this case is not 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.659
 can double more than seven times per 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.790
 half try at home with papers that 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.519
 you have and well that you can comment 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.409
 in the comments with what papers 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.000
 you have been able and with what not and I hope 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.489
 that you have liked that you have seemed 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.489
 interesting and good until another goodbye
