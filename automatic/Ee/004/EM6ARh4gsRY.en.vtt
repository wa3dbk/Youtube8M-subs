normal TDK but they're all headshots so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
normal TDK but they're all headshots so
longer<00:01:13.500> range<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.130> gonna<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.850> beneficial

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
longer range is gonna be more beneficial

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
longer range is gonna be more beneficial
to<00:01:15.420> me<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.439> rate<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> quick
