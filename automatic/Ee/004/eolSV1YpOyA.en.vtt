00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.220
 But it announces s 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.020
 Lead 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.150
 Continued 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.940
 US str ata-3800 units that want to experiment 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.509
 So-called 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.809
 Do it now 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.019
 Same 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.030
 old system 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.179
 say max 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.659
 Amaou strawberry 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:22.669
 same 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.640
 that's all 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.789
 What server use receives 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.029
 First of all, I really appreciate your support 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.810
 How to divide 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.900
 Overyear movie 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.970
 You say * 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.830
 I am with everyone 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.700
 It is re 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.660
 Advent net 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 This will also be a color like a 10 kg box 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.250
 I think whether to buy the upper price, but only this 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.700
 How fast you get in service 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 It is done by saying 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.650
 It is not because it is fine even if you expand it around 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.240
 is not it 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.930
 As a purchase position which did work, is it? 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.190
 There is also a carp month 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.000
 It is a powerful person who works for people who have only seen this 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 I want to be part of the cost together 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.159
 The announcement pressure is being killed 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.070
 End 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.520
 Actually 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 Run 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
 5 days depending on the weather 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040
 From Tokyo 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.910
 I think it's a bit difficult to understand so I'm calling 1.2 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.229
 I think so 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.229
 It is sometimes at a gas station 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.919
 It is after military service 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.819
 Small movements in Tokyo 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.739
 I showed muscle to the person 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.009
 Make it easy to understand 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.590
 1. 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.899
 4 rich 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.019
 surely 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.449
 I knew 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.719
 Kiss season 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.559
 ... 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.419
 Use from now on 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.549
 I will consider 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.319
 So this is it 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.489
 Saito is advancing 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.999
 I think it became the stage of the final 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.999
 I added this as it is 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.939
 This is right 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.939
 It is in a state of removing rust 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.879
 I think it is difficult to understand decorative 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.879
 Conversely, there is a place where you are doing here 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.489
 This was wrong 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.429
 that is 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:27.429
 I want to experiment 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.999
 that 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.369
 We devote to meeting place after break 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.939
 How is this going to change? 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.419
 There is no problem because it was 1910s I saw Kyoto 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.019
 It is 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.619
 You need to be alone 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.579
 Donate blood 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.859
 I'm doing great 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.739
 Because 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.879
 Just commentary 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.949
 Well then one more coach 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.050
 I'm going bad 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.499
 look carefully 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.499
 7. 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.999
 i 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.999
 Clever 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.759
 Czech ho country power declines 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.360
 I'm at this time 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.770
 Bird flu 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.770
 A little hard to understand 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.099
 It is a little hard to understand 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.569
 It is one win to win 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.800
 At the start 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.800
 As each support 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.099
 Also 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.349
 Only the email address goes up 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.139
 I'm putting a big search 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.499
 Nigoro 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.419
 I do not use this for only 1.9kg, but it is an example. 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.319
 A microscope compatible area winner 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.870
 Sapporo area 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.729
 There was after 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:47.999
 Let go 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.270
 I understood 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.580
 To column 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.979
 Wilmstad 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.979
 I think like this 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.680
 Specific 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.099
 Then 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.330
 If you look at this 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.099
 It is done 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.699
 Include service 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.699
 Said 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.569
 It is this one tune one tune one piece of this 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.569
 Fukudome will do only public office 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.659
 I am taking notes 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.059
 That's why I'm finding that and I'm wide enough 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:46.369
 Have you put on forever 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:50.479
 If you can throw the mat to the floor 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.479
 1 army practice joining body 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.710
 The iron that came out of the wagon after this 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.659
 Gold tongue 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.610
 Well it's important here 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.600
 As Paula's second son of Kim is a little qualified 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 Famous in this area 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.779
 3. 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.779
 It has fallen 

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:17.360
 Keep going 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.649
 Fell into this 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:22.749
 Originally it is such an atmosphere 

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.749
 I think it will hit the light at such time 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.139
 It looks like 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.839
 US employment 

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.289
 To sell this navigation material 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:35.149
 It does by saying 

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:38.719
 Ele If you try this, this is something else 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.009
 Very wasteful 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:40.860
 Do it there
