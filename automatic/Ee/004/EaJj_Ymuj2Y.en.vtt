00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
do it I really appreciate that because

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.690 
do it I really appreciate that because
it<00:03:18.989> challenges<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.769> mind<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.400> makes<00:03:20.549> you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
it challenges the mind and makes you

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.789 
it challenges the mind and makes you
really<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.569> spend<00:03:22.079> some<00:03:22.260> quality<00:03:22.530> time

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
really think and spend some quality time

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.430 
really think and spend some quality time
with<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.430> vehicle<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.269> terrain<00:03:24.569> now

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
with the vehicle and the terrain now

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.099 
with the vehicle and the terrain now
because<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.700> called<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.450> rock<00:03:27.720> crawler

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
improved on this further is the steering

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.030 
improved on this further is the steering
the<00:04:36.150> steering<00:04:36.390> motor<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:37.050> strong<00:04:37.500> enough<00:04:37.800> and

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
the steering motor is strong enough and

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.920 
the steering motor is strong enough and
it<00:04:38.220> works<00:04:38.460> consistently<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.720> wheels

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
it works consistently but the wheels

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.900 
it works consistently but the wheels
don't<00:04:40.170> turn<00:04:40.320> too<00:04:40.800> far<00:04:41.220> so<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.640> steering

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
don't turn too far so the steering

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.210 
don't turn too far so the steering
radius<00:04:42.480> is<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> little<00:04:43.080> bit<00:04:43.170> large<00:04:43.440> otherwise

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
radius is a little bit large otherwise

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.250 
radius is a little bit large otherwise
it's<00:04:44.730> a<00:04:44.790> great<00:04:44.970> vehicle<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.750> gets<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:46.020> solid

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
it's a great vehicle and gets a solid
