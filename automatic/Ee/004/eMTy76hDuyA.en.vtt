00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.220
 On Saturday night I'm up for a party 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.040
 and just went by in the mountains have 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.300
 i thought kemberg of the good loud 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.559
 Music is a bit of something 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.330
 Let's go in there, I said we just go 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.109
 take a look 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.109
 Oh, you shit dancing kripo 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.410
 so he has to come but a motto am 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.170
 sunday with the one hello today with the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.460
 kripo disco motto you have on the internet 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.610
 already seen why she even goes 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.900
 it's about bordering creepers and yes 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.910
 just welcome us from the beginning 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.230
 have in principle a new in the mod 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.140
 mob that 's just the disco creeper and 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.720
 So this can be noisy developer is 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.790
 Porta diskeeper in a few flowers 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.530
 However, the extra writes in the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.840
 description to it he does not tell us in 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.329
 which biometric passport he wants 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.620
 no one is overjoyed 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.080
 take surprise when he says so 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.820
 then suddenly from a disco tripa 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.840
 I've found the world here 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.119
 is still a bit broken from 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.770
 last time because of that 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.450
 that I imagined that today 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.430
 Anyway, that's because I am 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.660
 always imagine that they are everything anyway 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.700
 I just have a break 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.970
 I told the world you let so dear 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.289
 because the sauce breaks again 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.930
 well as I said so we can 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.220
 Of course, the sport of war in certain 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 billion probably not here 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.050
 You do not know where he is, as I said 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 spontaneously a normal flu and yes so 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.780
 As I said, we do not know that 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.979
 That's just by chance 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.149
 of course I could find out now 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.250
 Also do not find out where 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.039
 The sport will definitely go easy 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.459
 times from the fact that the disco 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.390
 crib is over here of the bond and then 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.800
 which of course also holds what 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.190
 probably also noticed in the intro 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.330
 is the first thing in this kripo 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.349
 which makes this crib noticeable 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.349
 Power is when I walk 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.030
 It is very easy to listen to very quiet music 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.130
 here sounds very nice hard partymusic 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 I would say yes and by doing so 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.289
 the body announces itself to what, so to speak 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.349
 a little stupid is that hears 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.880
 Maybe we too will hear as me 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.700
 do not know if it has definitely heard 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.380
 one that the kripo several melodies 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.690
 confused plays so briefly this 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.940
 that he was the song to play more often 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.440
 triggered the whole thing so yes 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.390
 several times, so to speak, must come 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.010
 development fell as moritz 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.690
 then the developer would have to 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.920
 pay attention that only a melody comes because 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.060
 otherwise it will sound a bit wild 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.870
 yes, that's probably a bit 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.120
 confused well maybe what else 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.319
 it stands out in the war so soon as we 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.959
 now have in front of us 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.840
 he is the fact that he is not now 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.540
 more consists of a whole part than 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.829
 sometimes it's enough for me oh I have 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.180
 even that quietly I'll do it again 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.620
 quieter we probably see that 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.569
 this war does not come from one part 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.829
 is normal and creeper with then 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.700
 yes not so stiff but consists of 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.530
 share three 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.450
 this splits in the middle once 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.560
 seen through twice each 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.609
 here is a part okay I 'm short 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.340
 and we gave it a bit 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.440
 can do better right now 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.630
 I do not have to go back here I have here 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.799
 times locked up and tried that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.880
 show it all again so there arises 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.709
 just three parts 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.819
 These parts are very nice if he is 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.290
 we lean forward so we see 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.569
 once this part here in the middle 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.269
 is and just head and foot that is whole 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.280
 determined from three parts and thereby is 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.340
 he just movable in the upper body and can 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.750
 just cool to do that is 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.130
 Of course, very interesting and what 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.120
 maybe she noticed too 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.200
 which is noticeable if we are a bit 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.060
 watch longer 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.130
 He is getting faster and faster with his 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.500
 head movement that means he always locks 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.680
 more of what, of course, very much 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.930
 I must say interesting 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.250
 as he gets faster and faster 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.099
 someday it's pretty fast 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.719
 made rapid fire head movements very much 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.680
 interesting so now what, of course, too 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.069
 Still the question is I am natural 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.890
 here in the creative mode not the 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.689
 set i am in survival mode for a short time 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.659
 and we'll just see something 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:11.950
 Also interesting is the value of the kripo 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.540
 it is also stronger than the normal one 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.750
 pieper what to see relatively quickly 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.430
 as soon as we explode in one 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.940
 I used to be okay just once 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.530
 he kills me and the crater 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.169
 the crisis also makes it bigger than the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.240
 normal flu i have a game mode 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.130
 without saying it kills me I know 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.690
 not flu would have me my 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.509
 do not look at this range 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.150
 probably killed the beautiful 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.650
 message 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.080
 we see that relatively big that is the one 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.310
 diskeeper what do we know about that 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.330
 the dancers are dancing 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.780
 So they make cool moves 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.220
 they make music and they make the biggest ones 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.960
 So cadres are stronger that's this one 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.039
 new mob of the disco over mod 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.440
 In addition, I think the whole thing pretty much 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.510
 actually cool and of course that brings 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.419
 nothing is a ride but I think 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.270
 still cool yes that's it 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.039
 The developer also said that he 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.789
 intends in the future more dancing pug 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.470
 insert 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.550
 that's pretty cool , of course 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.990
 that he will also dance one 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.240
 sharp makes and the chickens or dance 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.970
 What I do, however, is the mod now 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.320
 already almost one and a half years old and until 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.820
 now there is the disco fever that 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.770
 Of course it remains to be seen if 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.650
 there is something else to come 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.090
 but it would be cool and everything 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.960
 definitely fixed must be the only 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.610
 a song comes and if s i know yes 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.669
 not something for taste but he has 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.259
 might also like a bit melodic 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.530
 make crack liter pure than this 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.199
 dull secret but good that of course 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.220
 just my taste so good that was it 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.409
 for today I hope you enjoy it 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.810
 I just say thanks a lot 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.470
 for watching and bye bye 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.470
 next time
