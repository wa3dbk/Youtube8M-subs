set<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.410> pirate<00:01:57.830> tiles<00:01:58.070> there<00:01:58.940> is<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.180> ghost

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
set of pirate tiles there is a ghost

captain who gets placed on the ghost
island<00:02:01.490> in<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.670> middle<00:02:01.759> each<00:02:02.570> player<00:02:02.960> gets<00:02:02.990> a

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
island in the middle each player gets a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.370 
island in the middle each player gets a
reference<00:02:04.070> card<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.030> game<00:02:05.210> begins<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:06.319> a

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
reference card and the game begins on a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.180 
reference card and the game begins on a
player's<00:02:06.679> turn<00:02:06.800> they<00:02:07.759> simply<00:02:08.149> roll<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.720> die

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
player's turn they simply roll the die

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.260 
player's turn they simply roll the die
whatever<00:02:10.190> number<00:02:10.490> they<00:02:10.610> roll<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.000> let's<00:02:11.150> say

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
whatever number they roll so let's say

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.900 
whatever number they roll so let's say
they<00:02:11.420> roll<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:12.010> anybody<00:02:13.010> who<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.220> adjacent<00:02:13.610> to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
they roll to anybody who is adjacent to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.059 
they roll to anybody who is adjacent to
a<00:02:14.090> two<00:02:14.270> gets<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.140> resource<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.680> type<00:02:15.860> so

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
a two gets a resource of that type so

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.490 
a two gets a resource of that type so
for<00:02:16.250> example<00:02:16.640> white<00:02:17.600> here<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:17.960> next<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.380> two

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
for example white here is next to a two

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.130 
for example white here is next to a two
it<00:02:18.950> shows<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.310> goat<00:02:19.490> so<00:02:20.210> white<00:02:20.480> would<00:02:20.690> get<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> go

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
it shows it goat so white would get a go

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.430 
it shows it goat so white would get a go
orange<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.160> blue<00:02:22.310> are<00:02:22.550> both<00:02:22.730> next<00:02:23.000> to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
orange and blue are both next to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.680 
orange and blue are both next to
molasses<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.790> they<00:02:25.910> would<00:02:26.060> both<00:02:26.210> get<00:02:26.450> a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
molasses so they would both get a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.480 
molasses so they would both get a

moved<00:03:59.030> them<00:03:59.180> here<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.600> would<00:04:00.140> get<00:04:00.290> two<00:04:00.560> gold

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
moved them here I would get two gold

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.770 
moved them here I would get two gold
because<00:04:01.610> that's<00:04:01.790> what<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.030> shows<00:04:02.270> on<00:04:02.540> that

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
because that's what it shows on that

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.560 
because that's what it shows on that
resource<00:04:03.620> property<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.280> if<00:04:04.580> a<00:04:05.120> three<00:04:05.450> is

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
resource property and if a three is

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.810 
resource property and if a three is
rolled<00:04:05.870> blue<00:04:06.230> is<00:04:06.470> not<00:04:06.650> going<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.340> get<00:04:07.550> any

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
rolled blue is not going to get any

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.780 
rolled blue is not going to get any
reached<00:04:08.180> gold<00:04:08.570> resources<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.490> pirate

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
reached gold resources and so the pirate

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.450 
reached gold resources and so the pirate
is<00:04:10.880> moved<00:04:11.060> every<00:04:11.300> time<00:04:11.480> someone<00:04:11.750> plays<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.930> tile

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
is moved every time someone plays a tile

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.410 
is moved every time someone plays a tile
or<00:04:13.600> anytime<00:04:14.600> somebody<00:04:14.990> rolls<00:04:15.350> a<00:04:15.620> six<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:17.209> game

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
or anytime somebody rolls a six the game

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
which we're taking Settlers of Catan and

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.590 
which we're taking Settlers of Catan and
making<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.830> for<00:05:39.040> a<00:05:39.220> younger<00:05:39.550> crowd<00:05:39.730> but<00:05:40.510> it

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
making it for a younger crowd but it

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.000 
making it for a younger crowd but it
does<00:05:40.810> not<00:05:40.930> dumb<00:05:41.230> it<00:05:41.350> down<00:05:41.380> as<00:05:41.680> much<00:05:41.740> as<00:05:41.860> you

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
does not dumb it down as much as you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.370 
does not dumb it down as much as you
think<00:05:42.280> obviously<00:05:43.000> it<00:05:43.420> takes<00:05:44.080> the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
think obviously it takes the

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.860 
think obviously it takes the
distribution<00:05:45.270> instead<00:05:46.270> of<00:05:46.360> having<00:05:46.510> nine

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
distribution instead of having nine

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.610 
distribution instead of having nine
verse<00:05:47.380> six<00:05:47.770> verse<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.760> verse<00:05:49.150> 10<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:49.990> just<00:05:50.500> one

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
verse six verse to verse 10 it just one

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.710 
verse six verse to verse 10 it just one
two<00:05:50.740> three<00:05:50.980> four<00:05:51.250> or<00:05:51.370> five<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.970> that's<00:05:52.420> a<00:05:52.540> very

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
two three four or five and that's a very

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.120 
two three four or five and that's a very
even<00:05:53.080> distribution<00:05:53.170> so<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:53.800> doesn't<00:05:54.010> matter

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
even distribution so it doesn't matter

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.740 
even distribution so it doesn't matter
where<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:54.460> put<00:05:54.700> your<00:05:54.820> cities<00:05:55.150> you're<00:05:55.570> gonna
