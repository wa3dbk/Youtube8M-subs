00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
meat off the floor come on and once you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.559 
meat off the floor come on and once you

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
meet your my friend there we go okay so

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.449 
meet your my friend there we go okay so
there<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.959> go<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.470> worked<00:02:28.709> earth<00:02:29.069> might

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
there you go that worked earth might

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.100 
there you go that worked earth might
normally<00:02:29.880> it'll<00:02:30.209> go<00:02:30.330> into<00:02:30.630> your<00:02:30.690> backpack<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
normally it'll go into your backpack and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.770 
normally it'll go into your backpack and
it's<00:02:31.380> way<00:02:31.740> easier<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.940> that's<00:02:33.330> that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's way easier but that's that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.100 
it's way easier but that's that
situation<00:02:34.670> um<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.730> believe<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.420> also<00:02:36.959> works

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
situation um I believe it also works

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.170 
situation um I believe it also works
with<00:02:37.320> morphine<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:38.490> works<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:38.880> basically

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
with morphine it works with basically

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.820 
with morphine it works with basically
anything<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.989> have<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.380> right-click

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
anything that you have to right-click

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.030 
anything that you have to right-click
and<00:02:41.220> use<00:02:41.430> just<00:02:42.330> throwing<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.569> out<00:02:42.690> there<00:02:43.040> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
and use just throwing that out there so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.010 
and use just throwing that out there so
like<00:02:44.190> painkillers<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.600> because<00:02:45.900> my

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
like painkillers just because my

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.540
