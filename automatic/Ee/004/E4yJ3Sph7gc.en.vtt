00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
stayed in the lobby I kind of wanted to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.830 
stayed in the lobby I kind of wanted to
get<00:03:04.370> footage<00:03:04.579> see<00:03:04.879> if<00:03:04.909> anything<00:03:05.299> crazy<00:03:05.599> would

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
get footage see if anything crazy would

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.720 
get footage see if anything crazy would
happen<00:03:06.140> but<00:03:06.349> overall<00:03:06.680> nothing<00:03:07.280> really<00:03:07.430> did

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
happen but overall nothing really did

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.330 
happen but overall nothing really did
and<00:03:07.940> he's<00:03:08.720> spamming<00:03:09.079> hearts<00:03:09.530> right<00:03:09.799> now<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
and he's spamming hearts right now so I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.130 
and he's spamming hearts right now so I
thought<00:03:10.579> was<00:03:10.700> pretty<00:03:10.879> funny<00:03:11.120> but<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.989> this

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
thought was pretty funny but in this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.110 
thought was pretty funny but in this
Lobby<00:03:12.530> when<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.680> got<00:03:12.890> one<00:03:13.099> kill<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.609> went<00:03:13.910> all<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
Lobby when I got one kill I went all the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.150 
Lobby when I got one kill I went all the
way<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.359> level<00:03:14.870> 50<00:03:15.319> instead<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.769> going<00:03:16.040> up

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
way to level 50 instead of going up

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.250 
way to level 50 instead of going up
three<00:03:16.459> levels<00:03:16.790> like<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.000> was<00:03:17.180> previously<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.019> I

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
three levels like I was previously so I

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.740 
three levels like I was previously so I
thought<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.680> was<00:03:18.799> really<00:03:18.980> cool<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:20.540> think

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
thought that was really cool and I think

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.300 
thought that was really cool and I think
this<00:03:20.900> guy<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.109> called<00:03:21.440> him<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.590> Goliath<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.160> this

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
this guy I called him a Goliath and this

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.819 
this guy I called him a Goliath and this
guy<00:03:22.459> like<00:03:22.700> killed<00:03:23.180> my<00:03:23.299> wife<00:03:23.629> instantly<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:24.620> he
