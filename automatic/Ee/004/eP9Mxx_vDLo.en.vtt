00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.650
 single just got to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.389
 Morning run can take us from time to time 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.940
 something about the electrolytes again 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 fill 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 we do not eat the coconut meat 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.140
 directly the later and separately but 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.910
 the coconut water that's a force one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.949
 absolute power I have the link below 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.330
 purely in the description and still shines 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.869
 sometimes where I get my coconuts 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.900
 to get 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.130
 I think the prices are very good and there 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.540
 what I still here if it is one 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.559
 Coconut opener with child protection and 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 I'll show you now like a coconut 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.640
 open it and drink immediately 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.640
 that's just the great thing about the device 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.510
 So actually make us one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.640
 hammer on it and beat it on me 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.059
 always do it by hand because risk no 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.739
 fun 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.270
 so has a little challenge though 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.829
 take care that you do not sting 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.829
 Turn a little and that 's it 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:10.670
 I do the whole thing twice 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:14.510
 air outlet so to speak or intake her 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.340
 Look, it is already opened correctly 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:22.880
 I open just once again I have to 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.290
 We have always been honest here 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.640
 use again because I have so much 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.980
 produce plastic garbage 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.620
 I'm doing the test for you now 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.960
 I know it 's one, I'm just like that 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.880
 It's not a great job 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.880
 but I do that I think it's ok 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.580
 to be totally sweet totally delicious that 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.810
 you have to indulge in something like that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.850
 I am always so excited jany 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.549
 finally, it's like in the seventh heaven like in the sky 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.570
 seventh grade after the heat 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.110
 the run that would have to indulge 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.150
 It can grow up to about 400 milliliters 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.019
 450 in it in a big coconut 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.380
 on coconut water totally sweet totally 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.760
 delicious coconut meat are about 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.760
 at the last coconut names are 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.569
 always weighed 100 to 150 grams 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.200
 contain 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.319
 half of which seen by weight 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 fat and if you split that up 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.940
 Calories are about 80 of the calories 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.069
 cosmos flesh fat calories and that is 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.410
 course a fat bomb and should 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.450
 accordingly acted as an exception 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.280
 are exactly thereto, and otherwise 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.850
 Of course, super source because it quite 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.910
 fresh fed is even better 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.459
 vegetable still a thousand times better and that 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.840
 It's really a miracle 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.030
 wonder drug that really one 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.590
 miracle remedy from the shipper where i am 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.269
 Now you guys are the link down below type 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.549
 I certainly totally satisfied since 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.489
 two years coconuts this totally 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.600
 satisfied with the quality so far always 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.640
 Everything was great 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.109
 these are now young coconuts 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.209
 do you get in the normal shop 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.850
 Buy possibly in a part 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.519
 but that takes young troop is very 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.470
 a lot of water in it little meat not 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.140
 this hard meat or these brown ones 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.549
 old coconuts the one off and so ingo 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.700
 different to a supermarket or bio 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.370
 repurchase market gets young coconuts 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.420
 you have to pay attention to that 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.670
 By the way, in the summer I would do it in the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.250
 Refrigerated do they taste chilled 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.220
 Better to keep it better is easy 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.329
 cheaper in the heat and that me 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.970
 thought of it now when I get it then 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.069
 just beautiful again you can you 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.880

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.040
 water where like 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.090
 we'll think thank you for seeing 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.570
 Until next time
