00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 I did not just do it when I did it, but I'd do it with a knot. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:12.719
 What did you use it to clear the rope is released I do not think anything 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 So I packed it and marked 200 300. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.630
 Then what is that place? 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.160
 0 lotus flower's because many of the Nile Basin 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.750
 Ah cloth 0 to 1 to 2 geuryeotjyo 2000 yeopgo 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.009
 Then some people say that they are fingers , 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.350
 People are not yet built up the papyrus Yeah, I shoot it on papyrus 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.170
 I think the idea is more convincing. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 Age can be displayed on a large number of buds now busy growing a lot in New York 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.000
 I think it was. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.149
 Then $ 100 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.530
 I have a frog and I have two theories. 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.860
 Some people say the book've cried while others who called Frog 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 Frog tadpoles than would have displayed more numerous 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:07.409
 I think that by linking all the rivers that day, their culture and math closely 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.870
 We can see that it's connected with the natural environment and the climate. 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.980
 next 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:17.690
 Big saws with a million 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.760
 It has no meaning to use a huge range of imperial rule in the country 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.650
 I can see that it was very wide. 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:29.180
 The White Horse is his children to talk to you about that person the logic state 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:33.740
 Usually it is love of mom and dad what kind of thing Then it is as much as the ground like sky 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.400
 Give me a hand flashing the court to represent a human almost instinctive to him first few seconds 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.410
 same 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:44.060
 I can see the gleaming hand with a big 또는 or the sun god they believe 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.530
 The worship of the god is a prayer. 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.070
 Even if I think also good 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.840
 Anyway, I closed it out loud at that one million won . 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:57.800
 They even mark infinitely larger numbers when circled on a straight line 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.190
 I think it means sun on top of Jifang Line . 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.330
 Same as you 20 teams have made a number, which is precisely the angle 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.330
 It's a number. 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.760
 The Egyptians used hieroglyphs 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.540
 If you distinguish exactly three things, the divine character fuse character body character 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.820
 But this is a professional term, so I'm just skipping it. 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.580
 Usually because we are talking about numbers and they are used, 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:31.970
 Or hull number to talk to a high level 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 The number that they used to make is the number of their natural 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:41.000
 I can see that it's close to the environment. 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.550
 Oh, then, where do you write down those who will take it? Papyrus 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.920
 Let's think about 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:52.240
 Jusijyo lightly on papyrus Oh papi tide pools so I 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.370
 You just ride that usually when we go to Korean 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:01.430
 In Korea, Incheon him 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:06.350
 A place called Kun Incheon advisers go to that coming from a small air museum 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.890
 There is a botanical garden. I went there myself. 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.410
 It was 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:15.980
 4 They have papyrus and they make paper making earlier 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:20.840
 They made flat paper, and then the scribes did. 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.710
 They 're only 1% of those who can read and write. 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.030
 I was prominent . The people in the upper class were propositions. 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:34.700
 Making this papyrus haetgetjyo print parameters need to create a link After 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:40.610
 Papyrus is born, the soot it.I thought it better to burn the reeds later years 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:46.760
 I get the soot, mix it with the loess, or rust it 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.650
 It turns into a red color, and it is mixed with water. 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.440
 I said I wrote it. 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:59.600
 Then enjoy the paper and those that pop 3 paper and this is very much in the development of mathematics 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.360
 It is an important factor, so they've been able to further develop the mathematics 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.690
 With these efforts of the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:13.730
 If you'll be a very long long its going to be altered it has tremendous keoda 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.630
 Long wrote that three things had other disadvantages of the blood get in the fire is extinguished 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.880
 It was 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:25.580
 I do not like it as cultural heritage compared to the two gold Mesopotamian civilization 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:30.749
 Although civilization was very different in its contrast to its distinction 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:36.479
 It's a very funny imagination that writing instruments are worn out. 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:37.050
 Oh, I imagine they are funny when they look at their life they say that stocks are beer and bread 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.059
 It was 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.679
 We have a stock of rice, and it is the kind of food 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:48.899
 Is there a difference in concept 

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:51.089
 Because they eat bread, the problem of the fountain eating the bread is the real life 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:55.979
 There was a close relationship. 

00:04:51.089 --> 00:05:02.309
 Oh yeah, let's say we eat 9 of them divided by 10 people. 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:04.349
 Oh, well, nine of the breads are like this . Oh, that's a tenth of it. 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:08.430
 Squeeze and eat gourmet in ten minutes. 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:12.569
 Nine people go to the dark ages for 10 people get 10 minutes of eating oysters 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:16.740
 So if you put a shit in 10 minutes and 10 minutes and you cut a tenth of it 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.180
 If 9 is sick, it will be 9/10. 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.719
 I'll eat it. 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:28.139
 Oh, nine contrasts the relationship between Article 9 to take a chunk 10 minutes remaining ones 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:32.279
 If you eat crumbs , it's very unfair. 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:38.069
 So this distribution law called distribution mathematics has developed 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:42.509
 If Pharaoh's focus on delivering absolute power, it's evidence. 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.800
 But their diet is very much related to what bread is 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.789
 I think. 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:53.309
 What did they think, how nine of those 10 minutes so a third 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:56.490
 Then cut out of ELLE and then 30 minutes to 3 minutes + 2 1/5 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:06:00.300
 Add 30 minutes to ad 10 minutes . 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.709
 This was used as a unit fraction is a unit's high and all 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:09.269
 I did not use the yoghurt oil in a fraction of 1 molecule . 

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:12.899
 I used to be very helpful in the third minute, but I do not know why. 

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:20.789
 But two-thirds are eventually marked as unit fractions. 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:24.539
 2 minutes + 6 minutes yiraeyo their eating habits and their life and yet this math 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:28.619
 It's evidence that you're in a very close relationship. 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:30.629
 Did we think about each other because we ate rice? Of course there 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:36.119
 I think there's a difference. 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:40.379
 Of course, the example jitters also show numbers when they show fractions 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:45.560
 I'll show it to you next time. 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:51.990
 Uh, they wrote this papyrus while developing that number system. 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:56.999
 When the scribes recorded such a thing, they assumed the duty, and as government officials , 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:59.610
 , Causing a lot of things to clean up and to collect taxes, etc. that your door 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:04.650
 I have developed more and more. 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:07.009
 So then , let's look at another civilization and civilization of that captive turret. 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.009
 Please 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:21.460
 U 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:08:03.970
 wee wee
