00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.009
 hello I'm simon from iloveradio.de in 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.719
 I want to share this video with you 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.530
 Roth puts the checks together 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.660
 tune a bit 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.279
 I'm just getting my body fit 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.470
 would like to reduce a day of course 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.359
 my muscles because it is upright 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.710
 receive 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.080
 that is very important to me that you just 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.420
 his muscles always pay attention to this 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.679
 nutrients that is with 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.439
 protein building blocks to promote and completely 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.510
 that's why it's so important 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.450
 the three most important amino acids 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.920
 and they are of course a good one 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.450
 Keep pace with the wall 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.310
 For example, we have a check here 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.860
 five grams like cas 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.750
 that is certainly worth a lot 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.610
 that's not all, but it is 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.830
 ultimately not entirely 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.810
 a lot so i thought so myself 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.240
 just want this product what the 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.190
 what the bca salary still concerns 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.470
 Pimp up a little bit in the end 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.630
 especially in my very stressful 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.059
 training phase too and also what my 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.070
 Nutrition is called a second 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.469
 I 'm still a bit in 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.570
 with these special areas 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.600
 supply nutrients 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.090
 yes what I have there is a bz 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.490
 product in pure form that means here 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.359
 like c &amp; a blackpool from best buy one and 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.090
 fish are included only three bcaa 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.390
 amino acids leucine ii so 13 and warin 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.560
 plus a little release agent 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.450
 Silica does not make it 2000 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.390
 in the end, one can say that I am 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.819
 Here 100 percent pcs are in pure form 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.399
 and flavor or sweetener or dyes 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.479
 the whole thing is tasteless 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.850
 maybe also very important too 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.069
 mention that you are very good with it 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.810
 Check sybase 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.490
 according to the manufacturer , one should here of five 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.240
 grams of powder 100 milliliters of water 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.950
 stir in 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.319
 I tried that, I knew 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.539
 already what comes out but it is 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.869
 a thing of impossibility like c &amp; a 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.490
 Both to solve powder as well as just 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.189
 to get round in taste and taste 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.359
 in it 100 milliliters of water so there 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.649
 I was honestly not what the 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.420
 but the manufacturer thought so 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.319
 He has already tried it 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.690
 does not work 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.040
 it tastes good and it is in the reason 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.140
 also not feasible 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.550
 yes I'll show you how to do it anyway 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.770
 this product can work because it is one 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.890
 class products are just 100 percent 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.050
 Pure amino acids 350 grams pack 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.700
 There are 70 manufacturers there 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.080
 in my opinion even a few 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.750
 more because you do not even have five grams 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.150
 have to use my first time sufficient to 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.380
 three gram company good you can certainly 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.450
 to use 5 grams 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.220
 I show you how I simply times 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.160
 I'm just doing a white 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.640
 powder it nice it cube about 30 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.560
 gram 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.880
 as I said in this 30 gram are then 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160
 ever the first five grams 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.110
 contain 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.970
 from now on unfortunately also in the human replacement 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.220
 czekalla the others are all dirty 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.010
 or would I have to clean up slowly 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.150
 the judge also quite funny 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.920
 now we have the spare schenker 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:06.310
 work about 30 grams of powder 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:14.440
 namely, and about one 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:19.060
 teaspoon from the bca it a conversation 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.860
 I'll give you a teaspoon now 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.390
 It does not matter whether it is with water 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.490
 or infuse this with milk 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.740
 protein powder tastes just great 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.600
 milk well with water, it tastes like 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.270
 old chocolate with milk tastes 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.860
 really great has milk chocolate by 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.080
 then of course we take milk here 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.550
 for this for this thigh 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.170
 but it does not make any differences can 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.670
 it's just the same with milk to them 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.250
 only thing I did not say like that 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.650
 would recommend 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.480
 these bca are in pure form with only 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.580
 water or with juice or with milk too 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.030
 Solubility works 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.680
 not taste does not work 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.220
 at least not who any 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.220
 culinary claims product has with 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.390
 be quite bitterly disappointed 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.950
 I hope the shaker is good too 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.470
 closed as I said in the sentence he 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.409
 is really bad already some pieces then 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.150
 if you take too much of the bch 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.950
 you have the taste that the taste 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.539
 through comes through the shake comes through 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.539
 but in combination it is one 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.519
 Great thing so if I'm there 345 grams 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.530
 powder take taste comes easy 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.270
 not superimposed by that is so the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.370
 chocolate taste superimposed on the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:33.820
 taste of the bca is namely the 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:36.100
 by nature correct as the dosage 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.150
 the right fits is delicious you can tell 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.990
 just not that one here now 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.250
 even a teaspoon bca to someone's 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.750
 I'll check in comfortably 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.729
 stretch the couch then I take you 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.240
 not with what I wanted to say 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.000
 It is a great product in pure form 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.070
 tested in the lab made in germany 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.690
 the raw materials are one of mine 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.539
 You can also find favorites under one 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.889
 early de or in the link below 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.560
 from there for this video 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.330
 Product again as I said class 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.159
 to do his grandson a bit 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.680
 always makes sense when you look in 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.780
 very extreme training phases 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.030
 or very sporty 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.639
 the goal, for example, is the construction of 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.099
 muscular and especially namaste 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.810
 phase or definition and mine 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.330
 Company definition is a very 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.800
 difficult very hard because it fits 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.620
 Of course the way to the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.729
 corresponding claims 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.320
 to merge and find 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.909
 Alright I was there because of possible how 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.409
 Greetings only to the next video 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:36.629
 your simon yes that me 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.189
 meaning before that I believe I have 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.839
 average gentleman thus underestimated me 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:43.219
 believe it is very important for me 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:43.219
 Now again in this video of this
