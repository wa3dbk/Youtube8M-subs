which<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> funny<00:00:13.740> little<00:00:13.950> mixture<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.580> like

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
which is a funny little mixture of like

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.580 
which is a funny little mixture of like
a<00:00:15.299> jewel<00:00:15.599> stick<00:00:15.809> shooter<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.260> only<00:00:16.410> one

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
a jewel stick shooter with only one

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
a jewel stick shooter with only one
stick<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.220> i<00:00:17.250> guess<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> single<00:00:17.880> stick<00:00:18.210> shooter

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
stick so i guess a single stick shooter

stick so i guess a single stick shooter
then<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:20.279> sort<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.970> pac-man<00:00:21.680> because<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:22.980> you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
then and sort of pac-man because as you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
to do it in a set time limit in this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.799

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
ideal path without going back on

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.970 
ideal path without going back on
yourself<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.290> was<00:02:18.440> kind<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.680> crap

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
yourself so that was kind of crap

yourself so that was kind of crap
however<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.730> go<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.120> next<00:02:20.390> level<00:02:20.630> select

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
however if I go to the next level select

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.740 
however if I go to the next level select
thing<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.260> can<00:02:21.500> move<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.790> right<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.450> here

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
thing I can move to the right and here

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.940 
thing I can move to the right and here
you've<00:02:23.840> got<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.990> whole<00:02:24.110> bunch<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.500> new<00:02:24.650> levels

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
you've got a whole bunch of new levels

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.440 
you've got a whole bunch of new levels
to<00:02:25.100> try<00:02:25.340> out<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:25.880> haven't<00:02:26.180> done<00:02:26.270> these

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
to try out so I haven't done these

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.320 
to try out so I haven't done these
before<00:02:26.510> yep<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:28.190> little<00:02:28.460> power<00:02:28.880> up<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.210> can

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
before yep that little power up you can

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.080 
before yep that little power up you can
see<00:02:29.570> in<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> other<00:02:29.870> corner<00:02:30.140> oh<00:02:30.410> that's<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.830> warp

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
see in the other corner oh that's a warp

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.660 
see in the other corner oh that's a warp
ok<00:02:32.090> that's<00:02:32.330> worth<00:02:32.510> knowing<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.250> holes<00:02:34.520> or

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
ok that's worth knowing so this holes or

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.490 
ok that's worth knowing so this holes or
a<00:02:34.700> warper<00:02:35.030> puts<00:02:35.390> me<00:02:35.510> back<00:02:35.630> out<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.020> but<00:02:36.230> if<00:02:36.380> i

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
a warper puts me back out here but if i

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500 
a warper puts me back out here but if i
hit<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.770> orange<00:02:37.190> watch<00:02:37.490> boom<00:02:37.880> I'm<00:02:38.120> going<00:02:38.420> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
hit the orange watch boom I'm going to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.400 
hit the orange watch boom I'm going to
die<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.440> i<00:02:39.470> need<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.770> gobble<00:02:40.130> up<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.460> thing

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
die so i need to gobble up that thing

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.140 
die so i need to gobble up that thing
then<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.890> makes<00:02:43.070> me<00:02:43.220> swapped<00:02:43.490> twice<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
then this makes me swapped twice the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.840 
then this makes me swapped twice the
size<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.750> actually<00:02:45.650> makes<00:02:45.890> me<00:02:46.130> much<00:02:46.520> slower

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
size and actually makes me much slower

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.900 
size and actually makes me much slower
but<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.990> means<00:02:48.530> i<00:02:48.740> can<00:02:48.920> run<00:02:49.130> headfirst<00:02:49.430> into

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
but it means i can run headfirst into

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.710 
but it means i can run headfirst into
these<00:02:50.150> orange<00:02:50.510> buggers<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.350> not<00:02:51.890> get<00:02:52.070> hurt

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
these orange buggers and not get hurt

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.060 
these orange buggers and not get hurt
however<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.930> appears<00:02:54.170> have<00:02:54.320> only<00:02:54.410> last<00:02:54.740> for<00:02:54.920> a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
however it appears have only last for a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.960 
however it appears have only last for a
set<00:02:55.280> period<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:55.940> let<00:02:56.330> me<00:02:56.450> try<00:02:56.660> going<00:02:56.870> up<00:02:57.050> first

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
set period so let me try going up first

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.700 
set period so let me try going up first
and<00:02:58.970> then<00:02:59.120> we'll<00:02:59.210> go<00:02:59.330> across<00:02:59.540> here<00:02:59.660> do<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.590> this

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
and then we'll go across here do it this

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.440 
and then we'll go across here do it this
way

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.000 

it<00:03:04.080> expect<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.440> come<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.709> side

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
it expect to come out of that side

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.309 
it expect to come out of that side
whoops<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.430> easy<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.629> if<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.930> can<00:03:07.020> just<00:03:07.200> make
