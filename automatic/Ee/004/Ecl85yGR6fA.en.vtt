00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.580 
I haven't even checked it out or winter
biome<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.130> guess<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.000> then<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:12.989> got<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.200> pvp

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
biome I guess so then you got the pvp

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.020 
biome I guess so then you got the pvp
area<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.100> should<00:03:14.220> be<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.459> cool<00:03:14.760> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
area so this should be really cool and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.280 
area so this should be really cool and
then<00:03:15.120> obviously<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.600> can<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
then obviously you can go out to a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
then obviously you can go out to a
certain<00:03:16.680> point<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.160> don't<00:03:17.220> know<00:03:17.340> how<00:03:17.549> far<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.910> is

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
certain point I don't know how far it is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.060 
certain point I don't know how far it is
I<00:03:18.150> haven't<00:03:18.269> been<00:03:18.450> out<00:03:18.600> there<00:03:18.780> yet<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.650> then

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
I haven't been out there yet but then

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.110 
I haven't been out there yet but then
you'll<00:03:20.190> obviously<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.579> able<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.790> build<00:03:20.970> your

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you're able to actually start building

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.880 
you're able to actually start building
your<00:03:26.160> base<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.510> could<00:03:28.079> put<00:03:28.200> my<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.470> name<00:03:28.709> or

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
your base so I could put my like name or

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.110 
your base so I could put my like name or
something<00:03:29.070> out<00:03:29.280> here<00:03:29.459> before<00:03:29.730> anyone<00:03:30.030> else

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
something out here before anyone else

something out here before anyone else
gets<00:03:30.239> out<00:03:30.540> here<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:30.930> I'm<00:03:31.380> not<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
gets out here but I'm not going to so it

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
gets out here but I'm not going to so it
should<00:03:33.030> say<00:03:33.209> something<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.720> should<00:03:33.930> be<00:03:33.989> able<00:03:34.049> to

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
should say something I should be able to

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.560 
should say something I should be able to
actually<00:03:34.260> build<00:03:34.470> here<00:03:34.709> now<00:03:34.859> yep<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.510> is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
actually build here now yep so this is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.330 
actually build here now yep so this is
where<00:03:36.660> I'm<00:03:36.750> able<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.019> build<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.500> then<00:03:37.859> I<00:03:37.950> can

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
where I'm able to build and then I can

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.420 
where I'm able to build and then I can
build<00:03:38.549> here<00:03:39.109> yep<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:41.040> basically<00:03:41.160> the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
build here yep so that's basically the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.660 
build here yep so that's basically the
server<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.510> link<00:03:42.750> will<00:03:43.470> dogs<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.370> cool
