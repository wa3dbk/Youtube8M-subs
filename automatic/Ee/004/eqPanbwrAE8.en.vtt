00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.690 
combining that with a little bit of more
of<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.380> contemporary<00:01:55.860> dance<00:01:56.040> Sensibility

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of a contemporary dance Sensibility

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
of a contemporary dance Sensibility
without<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.509> becoming<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.140> mean<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.380> lot<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
without it becoming I mean a lot of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.429 
without it becoming I mean a lot of
choreographers<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.820> look

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
choreographers do that but it can look

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.569 
choreographers do that but it can look
broken<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.920> look<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.369> different

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
broken it can look like two different

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.990 
broken it can look like two different
dance<00:02:02.939> styles<00:02:03.060> kind<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.750> fashion<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:05.549> like

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
dance styles kind of fashion and I like

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.690 
dance styles kind of fashion and I like
the<00:02:06.299> idea<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.810> them<00:02:07.049> sort<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.920> holding

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the idea of them sort of of holding

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.390 
the idea of them sort of of holding
hands<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.330> way

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
hands in a way

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.220 
hands in a way
you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.640> create<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.970> work<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.569> perform<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.140> in

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
you can create a work and perform it in

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.520 
you can create a work and perform it in
the<00:02:14.319> studio<00:02:14.530> rehearse<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.190> studio<00:02:15.550> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
the studio rehearse it in the studio and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.280 
the studio rehearse it in the studio and
then<00:02:17.819> think<00:02:18.819> how<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.450> kind<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.840> works<00:02:19.900> but

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
then think how this kind of works but

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.199 
then think how this kind of works but
I'm<00:02:20.379> not<00:02:20.470> really<00:02:20.620> sure<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:21.910> put<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
I'm not really sure and then you put it

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.670 
I'm not really sure and then you put it
in<00:02:22.300> costume<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.810> put<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.080> on<00:02:23.170> stage<00:02:23.440> and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
in costume and you put it on stage and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.150 
in costume and you put it on stage and
it<00:02:23.739> becomes<00:02:25.650> something<00:02:26.650> completely

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
it becomes something completely

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.670 
it becomes something completely
different<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:28.060> looks<00:02:28.120> different<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
different it looks different it's the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.460 
different it looks different it's the
way<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.860> light<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.519> body<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.840> suddenly

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
way you light the body you can suddenly

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.140 
way you light the body you can suddenly
discover<00:02:32.920> lying<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.670> car<00:02:33.819> Rafi<00:02:34.030> that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
discover lying in the car Rafi that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.330 
discover lying in the car Rafi that
wasn't<00:02:34.360> there<00:02:34.480> before<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.040> thought<00:02:36.220> it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
wasn't there before so I thought it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.680 
wasn't there before so I thought it
would<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.459> be<00:02:36.610> an<00:02:36.760> interesting<00:02:37.000> experiment

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
would just be an interesting experiment

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.710 
would just be an interesting experiment
to<00:02:37.750> see<00:02:37.959> what<00:02:38.080> happens<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.739> work<00:02:39.720> it's

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
to see what happens to this work it's

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.199 
to see what happens to this work it's
risky<00:02:41.549> but<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.640> think<00:02:42.849> that's<00:02:43.000> what's

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
risky but I think that's what's

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.970 
risky but I think that's what's
interesting<00:02:43.390> about<00:02:43.720> about<00:02:44.380> playing<00:02:44.709> around

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
interesting about about playing around

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.910 
interesting about about playing around
and<00:02:45.540> why<00:02:46.540> not<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.140> know<00:02:47.260> why<00:02:47.410> not<00:02:47.440> experiment

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
and why not you know why not experiment

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.089 
and why not you know why not experiment
a<00:02:48.190> little<00:02:48.400> bit<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> great<00:02:53.739> thing<00:02:53.890> about

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
a little bit it's a great thing about

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.240 
a little bit it's a great thing about
drawing<00:02:55.140> Chris<00:02:56.140> making<00:02:56.500> his<00:02:56.650> work<00:02:56.950> and

capture the kind of inside inside how do

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.559 
capture the kind of inside inside how do
I<00:04:09.500> put<00:04:09.769> it

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569

I<00:06:01.350> think<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.800> ballet<00:06:01.980> world<00:06:02.280> in<00:06:02.910> particular

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
I think the ballet world in particular

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.670 
I think the ballet world in particular
needs<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.230> become<00:06:04.590> more<00:06:05.010> accessible<00:06:05.340> and

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
needs to become more accessible and

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.740 
needs to become more accessible and
there<00:06:07.680> are<00:06:07.770> so<00:06:07.920> many<00:06:08.010> ways<00:06:08.220> to<00:06:08.430> do<00:06:08.580> that<00:06:08.760> now<00:06:09.000> it

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
there are so many ways to do that now it

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.090 
there are so many ways to do that now it
doesn't<00:06:09.930> have<00:06:10.170> to<00:06:10.320> just<00:06:10.350> be<00:06:10.560> about<00:06:10.770> you<00:06:11.070> know

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100
