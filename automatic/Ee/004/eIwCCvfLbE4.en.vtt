00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the diamond knife is single-use again

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.039 
the diamond knife is single-use again
like<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> ire<00:01:04.589> knife<00:01:04.920> its<00:01:05.850> long-range<00:01:06.330> also

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
like the ire knife its long-range also

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
like the ire knife its long-range also
but<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> has<00:01:07.500> 22<00:01:08.159> hearts<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.670> damage<00:01:09.030> which

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
in one hit but it's in a stack of 16

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
in one hit but it's in a stack of 16
which<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.150> smaller<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.619> better<00:01:16.920> by

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
which is smaller but it's better by

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
miles so I'm yes these are the two

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
miles so I'm yes these are the two
knives<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> narrows<00:01:21.180> our<00:01:21.330> third<00:01:21.720> knife

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
knives and the narrows our third knife

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.219 
knives and the narrows our third knife
which<00:01:22.590> has<00:01:22.830> multiple<00:01:23.430> uses<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.990> called

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
which has multiple uses and it's called

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649 
which has multiple uses and it's called
the<00:01:25.409> infinity<00:01:26.040> knife<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> craft<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the infinity knife now to craft this is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.780 
the infinity knife now to craft this is
the<00:01:27.720> blocker<00:01:27.930> diamond<00:01:28.380> block<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> gold<00:01:29.159> block

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the blocker diamond block of gold block

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.090 
the blocker diamond block of gold block
of<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.030> am<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.689> stick<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.890> has

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
of I am and they stick and this has

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190 
of I am and they stick and this has
multiple<00:01:32.549> uses<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.509> when<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.869> hit<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
multiple uses so when you hit it you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.870 
multiple uses so when you hit it you
have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.650> collect<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.189> from<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.670> mob

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
have to go and collect it from the mob

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.200 
have to go and collect it from the mob
it<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.140> long<00:01:37.409> range<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.700> fire

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it is up to long range so you can fire

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.719 
it is up to long range so you can fire
it<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.659> miles<00:01:39.869> away<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.340> does<00:01:41.490> two

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it from miles away but it does two

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.460 
it from miles away but it does two
hearts<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> damage<00:01:42.329> now<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.720> think<00:01:43.350> for

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
hearts of damage now I think for

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.319 
hearts of damage now I think for
something<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.920> requires<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.700> block<00:01:45.149> of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
something that requires a block of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.560 
something that requires a block of
diamond<00:01:45.750> golden<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:47.250> expensive<00:01:47.700> minerals

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
diamond golden really expensive minerals

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.980 
diamond golden really expensive minerals
like<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> diamond<00:01:49.470> um<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.670> should<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
like the diamond um it should be or to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.730 
like the diamond um it should be or to
do<00:01:52.470> slightly<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.250> damage<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.590> can

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
do slightly more damage but it's you can

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.810 
do slightly more damage but it's you can
use<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.159> long<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.280> possible<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.759> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
use it for as long as possible so I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.389 
use it for as long as possible so I
spoilers<00:01:57.180> plus<00:01:57.560> there's<00:01:58.560> 10<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.070> stack

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
spoilers plus there's 10 and a stack

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.649 
spoilers plus there's 10 and a stack
let's<00:01:59.729> go<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.630> find<00:02:00.710> some<00:02:01.710> mobs<00:02:02.540> quickly<00:02:03.540> use

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
let's go and find some mobs quickly use

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630 
let's go and find some mobs quickly use
the<00:02:03.810> iron<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.320> they<00:02:04.799> all<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.280> less<00:02:05.490> do

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the iron one they all more or less do

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.969 
the iron one they all more or less do
the<00:02:05.820> same<00:02:06.060> thing<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.930> actually<00:02:07.829> even

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the same thing so if I can actually even

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
the same thing so if I can actually even
find<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.489> mob<00:02:08.670> will<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.140> earth

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
find a mob will have to go on this earth

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.120 
find a mob will have to go on this earth

get on so I'm get on so yeah that's
gonna<00:02:16.120> was<00:02:16.390> obviously<00:02:16.750> dying<00:02:17.110> for<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.280> do

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
gonna was obviously dying for it to do

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.010 
gonna was obviously dying for it to do
that<00:02:18.580> because<00:02:18.760> usually<00:02:19.060> they<00:02:19.540> wouldn't<00:02:19.840> die

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020
