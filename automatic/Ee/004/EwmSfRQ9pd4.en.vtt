bright our burn from the Revlon this is

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.650 
bright our burn from the Revlon this is
the<00:00:19.289> same<00:00:19.590> brand<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.220> used<00:00:20.460> last<00:00:20.699> time<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the same brand that I used last time I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.009 
the same brand that I used last time I
did<00:00:22.170> strawberry<00:00:22.619> blonde<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.670> due<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> my<00:00:24.510> hair

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
did strawberry blonde but due to my hair

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.790 
did strawberry blonde but due to my hair
being<00:00:25.580> natural<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.019> really<00:00:28.019> dark<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.590> came

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
being natural and really dark it came

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.420 
being natural and really dark it came
out<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:30.000> nice<00:00:30.619> light<00:00:31.619> brown<00:00:31.890> color<00:00:32.189> but

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
out like this nice light brown color but

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.760 
out like this nice light brown color but
this<00:00:33.000> actually<00:00:33.329> took<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> lot<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.440> color<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
this actually took a lot to the color I

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.250 
this actually took a lot to the color I
think<00:00:34.969> because<00:00:35.969> my<00:00:36.329> hair<00:00:36.540> was<00:00:36.570> already<00:00:37.020> died

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
think because my hair was already died

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
think because my hair was already died
so<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> took<00:00:38.280> better<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> color<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.510> it's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so it took better to the color and it's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.850 
so it took better to the color and it's
and<00:00:40.379> even<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> roots<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.820> grew<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and even at the roots that grew it's a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
and even at the roots that grew it's a
really<00:00:44.460> light<00:00:45.270> color<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:48.379> guys<00:00:49.730> like<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.149> love
