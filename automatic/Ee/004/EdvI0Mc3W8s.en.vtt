 the river just want to show them shorter than 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:17.150
 we do tears but he has something 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:21.789
 sensuality how much 2014 is here 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:25.089
 I was scratching 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.000
 1000 1000 pelts 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:32.320
 on a typewriter luish smoke and walked the street 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 3 3000 m3 law make here was a bumper 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.269
 scratched me nothing will paint and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:46.750
 that's just how to paste over the bath 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:51.100
 I'll stop and so he has space for sure 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.799
 paint here from any whether I was 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.199
 affected could be pasted over this 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:02.530
 lines in principle although silver light 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:07.240
 maybe not a good option lips I 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:11.350
 I tend to varnish here 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.950
 move here like a little turn 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:22.799
 do here by line unstick it of course 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.799
 the same spotlight but this resource we also glue 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.820
 it 's a good line but also for the throne 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.380
 there will be light so countries then ours falls and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:43.640
 I think that I pasted over 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:48.110
 here at the bottom of that track; 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.010
 here and here too, like a little 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.640
 goes where too could be in 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.950
 principle 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.950
 there go further there further do 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.460
 the transition to in this case had to god 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.440
 require a grille and it is very convenient as 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.250
 all i just omit here and here 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.620
 for anything i will make the transition to i don't know 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.000
 may be much further may be here 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.050
 not yet decided not going to be going 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.300
 probably still here to not 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.310
 need to touch 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.190

 just nowhere to put the phone to 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.220
