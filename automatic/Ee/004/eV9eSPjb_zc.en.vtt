00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.450 
cool stuff on this guitar is his
original<00:02:10.240> Frankenstein<00:02:11.170> actually<00:02:11.680> had<00:02:11.830> the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
original Frankenstein actually had the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.340 
original Frankenstein actually had the
humbucking<00:02:13.210> pickup<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.840> then<00:02:13.930> he<00:02:14.020> had<00:02:14.170> it

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
humbucking pickup and then he had it

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.400 
humbucking pickup and then he had it
sort<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.770> wired<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.550> way<00:02:15.580> where<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.410> some

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
sort of wired in a way where like some

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.900 
sort of wired in a way where like some
of<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.560> parts<00:02:17.860> were<00:02:17.920> still<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:18.670> here's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
of the parts were still in it so here's

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.510 
of the parts were still in it so here's
a<00:02:18.970> selector<00:02:19.900> switch<00:02:19.930> that's<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.770> set<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.340> one

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
a selector switch that's just set to one

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.240 
a selector switch that's just set to one
position<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.959> believe<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
position and I believe that the the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.309 
position and I believe that the the
single<00:02:24.850> coil<00:02:25.090> pickup<00:02:25.480> still<00:02:25.780> works<00:02:26.050> although

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
single coil pickup still works although

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.640 
single coil pickup still works although
I've<00:02:27.250> never<00:02:27.310> actually<00:02:27.730> act<00:02:28.090> tried<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.840> another

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
I've never actually act tried it another

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.740 
I've never actually act tried it another
part<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.100> guitar<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.550> he<00:02:30.730> took<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.120> full

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
part of this guitar is he took a full

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.750 
part of this guitar is he took a full
strat<00:02:32.110> Piccard<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.340> cut<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.640> down

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
strat Piccard and just cut it down

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.280 
strat Piccard and just cut it down
because<00:02:34.450> they<00:02:34.570> actually<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.110> pickguard

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
because they actually the pickguard

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.260 
because they actually the pickguard
would<00:02:35.590> go<00:02:35.740> through<00:02:35.950> cover<00:02:36.550> most<00:02:36.820> of<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.060> body

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
would go through cover most of the body

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.360 
would go through cover most of the body
just<00:02:37.540> covered<00:02:38.350> what<00:02:38.530> he<00:02:38.650> needed<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.250> he

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
just covered what he needed just so he

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.750 
just covered what he needed just so he
could

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
could

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.910 
could
cover<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.840> control<00:02:41.170> cavity<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.770> get<00:02:41.890> a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
cover the control cavity and get a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.160 
cover the control cavity and get a
volume<00:02:42.340> knob<00:02:42.459> on<00:02:42.670> there<00:02:42.940> if<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.780> spin<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
volume knob on there if I spin the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.460 
volume knob on there if I spin the
guitar<00:02:44.470> over<00:02:44.830> back<00:02:45.760> here<00:02:46.060> there's<00:02:47.020> some<00:02:47.260> road

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
guitar over back here there's some road

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.170 
guitar over back here there's some road
wear<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.040> there's<00:02:48.220> some<00:02:48.370> tape<00:02:48.640> on<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:49.030> where

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
wear on it there's some tape on it where

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.500 
wear on it there's some tape on it where
he<00:02:49.330> actually<00:02:49.660> stuck<00:02:49.930> his<00:02:50.080> guitar<00:02:50.410> picks

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
he actually stuck his guitar picks

the guitar would shift a little bit the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 
the guitar would shift a little bit the
guitar<00:03:10.780> would<00:03:10.900> go<00:03:11.019> out<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.290> tune<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.880> he

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
guitar would go out of tune so what he

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.449 
guitar would go out of tune so what he
did<00:03:13.300> was<00:03:13.870> put<00:03:13.930> six<00:03:14.410> bolts<00:03:14.800> normally<00:03:15.310> this

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
did was put six bolts normally this

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.970 
did was put six bolts normally this
would<00:03:15.519> have<00:03:15.790> four<00:03:16.120> bolts<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.410> outside<00:03:17.799> he

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
would have four bolts on the outside he

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.800 
would have four bolts on the outside he
put<00:03:18.190> another<00:03:18.700> couple<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.269> bolts<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.600> kind<00:03:19.780> of

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
put another couple of bolts to kind of

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.509 
put another couple of bolts to kind of
keep<00:03:19.959> everything<00:03:20.230> stable<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.130> he<00:03:21.280> would<00:03:21.400> did

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
keep everything stable so he would did

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.580 
keep everything stable so he would did
all<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.790> weird<00:03:22.600> stuff<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.350> kind<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
all this weird stuff to it to kind of

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.259 
all this weird stuff to it to kind of
make<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.769> work<00:03:23.920> for<00:03:24.310> him<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:26.549> really<00:03:27.549> only<00:03:28.060> him

surely jimi hendrix obviously before him
but<00:03:47.200> Eddie's<00:03:47.470> certainly<00:03:48.220> made<00:03:48.459> his<00:03:48.489> place<00:03:49.209> in

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570
