00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.330
 do 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.039
 pretty 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.930
 Today I 'm going to give you some tips and 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.700
 tips that I do to have the skin 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.350
 pretty much pretty I'm not saying that 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.940
 I have it perfect because we do not have the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.010
 perfect 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.250
 I hope this helps you and helps you 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.150
 much much much good let's start 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.890
 obviously to have a pretty skin 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.690
 first you have to be fine by 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.580
 inside I recommend you to take two 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.380
 liters of water a day I know it's super 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.150
 difficult and it sounds super simple but 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.340
 calm you can start with a pint 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.680
 a liter and a half liter until you reach 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.360
 the 2 liters this is vital that is vital 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.160
 so that your skin does not have any level 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 You can also eat lots of fruits and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.170
 vegetables 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.940
 my second type that I use is a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.789
 ointment that the truth when I the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.080
 gave away was I did not like the truth 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.210
 has a 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.010
 a super super ugly physicist is called 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.950
 You can find tepezcohuite in 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.340
 any naturist store is an ointment 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.860
 as black as loud I piedritas 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.080
 I use for granites the brands of 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.250
 things the truth is magical without 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.070
 shred your finger 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.990
 muddy type horrible volcanoes with 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.750
 just use a little bit in the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.630
 I beat one night after the next 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.369
 acknowledgments down to you tomorrow 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.500
 also super good for burns 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.390
 and those same things but leave photos 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.390
 end here two pieces of information so that 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.310
 they can locate and as good what 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.840
 also used me a lot a lot is a 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.850
 mask that the truth is super 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.200
 simple super economic and the truth 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.539
 bet to be skin tickets like 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.220
 softer and whiten the obviously 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.659
 always always as I said in life 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.700
 of hair treatments sites have 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.770
 a pretty skin should be super constant 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.829
 you should try to make masks 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.610
 once a week and exfoliating once 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.430
 a month 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.820
 and uses yogurt yogurt mask 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.340
 natural with oatmeal just like that 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.410
 Easy I mix yogurt with oats me 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.240
 I apply on the entire face left to dry 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.310
 the yogurt and rinse with cold water 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.320
 It is always very important that it will make you 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.390
 see the makeup face or not you 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.640
 make-up because because we are in a 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.110
 world where there is so much pollution 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.570
 where simply going out on the street 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.430
 it fogs them here we won and never get 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.790
 you touch the face with your hands 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.680
 dirty never never do it for all 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.879
 the people that we put on many 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.459
 Sometimes many people think that 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.840
 Make-up affects you in the face 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.819
 wrinkle and those things because the truth is not 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.819
 the makeups lately and you 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.430
 limit have vitamin e 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.680
 which is the fps factor many times when 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.540
 we take photos we go super white 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 and many of us think that they do not see here that 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.400
 we are left but white is not shown 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.470
 but not the fps makeup is nothing more 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.630
 what sun block in the ducts 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.970
 these machines salt to the sun is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.680
 Super protected the truth if you do not like it 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.750
 makeup is super father but if 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.450
 they use sunscreen that's something 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.239
 vital lately you're going to cancer 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.420
 We are in a world where we already 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.790
 this is so intense that you will use 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.340
 a good blocker too I'll 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.380
 I recommend a lot if you have to barry 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.760
 everything if the quintín this minister if the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.860
 true before going to a person with 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.830
 Acne 11 with anime has a mud 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 horrifying literally frightening then 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.930
 what I used was aloe vera 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.790
 it's super simple to get the truth 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.530
 I feel we all have a little plant 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.330
 come out of our house you're just going to 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.549
 cut a penca you're going to leave by the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.130
 half the pavita you will apply in all 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.630
 but watch your face the truth if you go 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.580
 this mask I feel like it's about 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.799
 be super of your plot and not talk 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.180
 because if you get to speak you are going to 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.890
 make the marks 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.599
 of the wrinkle when you want 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.000
 Masks I recommend that the literal 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.099
 do not talk and what I recommend a lot 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.799
 much this pillage if the sunstroke the 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.719
 you can do super simple and the system 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.829
 the commercial exfoliates the truth 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.409
 a commercial scrub 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.049
 I recommend but you must choose not very 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.989
 natural you can find them in stores 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.909
 in several places in health food stores 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.009
 the scrubs are something super good that 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.440
 we must do because they take away 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.419
 dead cells of your skin and well 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.340
