casing<00:00:16.860> I'm<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.210> use<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.810> long<00:00:20.840> adapter

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
casing I'm going to use the long adapter

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.109 
casing I'm going to use the long adapter
that<00:00:22.529> helps<00:00:22.950> it<00:00:23.100> adjust<00:00:23.520> it<00:00:23.700> straight<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
that helps it adjust it straight and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.929 
that helps it adjust it straight and
level<00:00:24.210> once<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:24.990> chest<00:00:25.939> you'll

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
level once it's on your chest you'll

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.160 
level once it's on your chest you'll
need<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.450> use<00:00:27.480> your<00:00:27.770> vented<00:00:28.770> helmet<00:00:29.670> strap<00:00:30.170> so

little bit more room to slide this

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.030 
little bit more room to slide this
through<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.470> on<00:00:55.680> this

unstitched it and looped it around
itself<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.570> creating<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.080> loop<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
itself right here creating this loop and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550 
itself right here creating this loop and
what<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.920> does<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:33.600> loop<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.140> around

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the bottom this bracket part here to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.590 
the bottom this bracket part here to
help<00:01:38.369> stabilize<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.180> because<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.479> you're

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
help stabilize it because when you're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
help stabilize it because when you're
writing<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> want<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> fall

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
writing it's going to want to fall

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.170

forward<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.540> look<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.080> ground<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> there

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
forward and look at the ground so there

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.179 
forward and look at the ground so there
it<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.330> fully<00:01:45.810> mounted<00:01:46.080> as<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.799> tell<00:01:46.979> I've

hydration<00:01:49.710> part<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> top<00:01:50.400> this<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.909> here

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
hydration part the top this right here

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.170 
hydration part the top this right here
just<00:01:52.229> looped<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> around<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.979> bottom<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.030> all

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just looped it around the bottom and all

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.520 
just looped it around the bottom and all
that<00:01:54.390> does<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.630> prevent<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.320> from<00:01:55.439> falling

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that does is prevent it from falling

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
that does is prevent it from falling
forward<00:01:56.189> while<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:56.729> writing<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.960> i

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
forward while you're writing and i

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.830 
forward while you're writing and i
believe<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.619> actual<00:01:59.460> gopro<00:01:59.880> strap<00:02:00.270> chest

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
believe the actual gopro strap chest

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.530 
believe the actual gopro strap chest
mount<00:02:01.130> straps<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.180> over<00:02:03.329> your

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
mount straps have go up and over your

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.899 
mount straps have go up and over your
shoulders<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.439> prevent<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
shoulders to prevent that but this is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.150 
shoulders to prevent that but this is
the<00:02:06.030> homemade<00:02:06.360> version<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.890> take<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the homemade version so just take that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
the homemade version so just take that
extra<00:02:08.369> strap<00:02:08.729> loop<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.049> bottom

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
