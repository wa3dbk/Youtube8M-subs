awesome background hook those fish once
you<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.270> them<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.470> matching<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.400> up

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
you get them on it so matching it up

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.280 
you get them on it so matching it up
with<00:02:17.610> an<00:02:17.730> ardent<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.630> new<00:02:18.750> edge<00:02:18.960> reels

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
with an ardent one of the new edge reels

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.750 
with an ardent one of the new edge reels
and<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.830> using<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> seven<00:02:20.550> three<00:02:20.730> two

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
and I'm using it with a seven three two

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.410 
and I'm using it with a seven three two
one<00:02:21.530> they<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.800> different<00:02:22.830> speeds

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
one they have it in different speeds

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.580 
one they have it in different speeds
this<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> new<00:02:25.260> prototype

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
this is just one of the new prototype

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.800 
this is just one of the new prototype
reel<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.850> what<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.240> my<00:02:27.330> hands<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.660> I'd

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
reel so this is what get my hands on I'd

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.180 
reel so this is what get my hands on I'd
probably<00:02:28.080> recommend<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.130> a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
probably recommend going with like a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.980 
probably recommend going with like a
five<00:02:29.460> point<00:02:29.880> two<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.210> one

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
five point two to one

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.250 
five point two to one
get<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.410> slower<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:31.920> bit<00:02:32.130> more

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
get that slower a little bit more

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.710 
get that slower a little bit more
strength<00:02:34.260> reeling<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.740> those<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:36.060> big<00:02:36.330> big

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
strength reeling in those this big big

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.330 
strength reeling in those this big big
rig<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.200> basically<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.710> this<00:02:37.800> one<00:02:37.980> pre-rigged

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
rig I basically have this one pre-rigged

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.160 
rig I basically have this one pre-rigged
this<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.640> actually<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.970> junior<00:02:39.300> version<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
this is actually the junior version and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.690 
this is actually the junior version and
we're<00:02:40.410> here<00:02:40.560> at<00:02:40.620> Grand<00:02:40.920> Lake<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.460> because

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
we're here at Grand Lake and because

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.100 
we're here at Grand Lake and because
there's<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> boat<00:02:42.330> docks<00:02:42.600> I'd

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
there's a lot of boat docks I'd

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.480 
there's a lot of boat docks I'd
recommend<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> smaller<00:02:44.220> version

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
recommend going with a smaller version

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.810 
recommend going with a smaller version
like<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.540> junior<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.500> got<00:02:46.740> a

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
like this this junior it's got a

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.010 
like this this junior it's got a
five-inch<00:02:47.820> wire<00:02:48.030> instead<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.570> six<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.960> a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
five-inch wire instead of a six and a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.110 
five-inch wire instead of a six and a
half<00:02:49.050> inch<00:02:49.320> wire<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.830> allows<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.790> make

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
half inch wire and allows you to make

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.640 
half inch wire and allows you to make
easier<00:02:51.480> roll<00:02:51.720> casts<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.260> stuff<00:02:52.440> you're

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
easier roll casts and stuff you're

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.250 
easier roll casts and stuff you're
working<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:52.950> edges<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:53.580> docks<00:02:53.820> or<00:02:54.150> points<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
working on edges of docks or points and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.470 
working on edges of docks or points and
so<00:02:55.380> forth<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.860> then<00:02:56.340> we've<00:02:57.030> got<00:02:57.210> two<00:02:57.300> rigged

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
so forth and then we've got two rigged

you can use swim baits you can use you
know<00:03:21.420> hollow<00:03:21.690> belly<00:03:21.870> type<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.410> prefer<00:03:22.709> this

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
know hollow belly type so I prefer this

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.010 
know hollow belly type so I prefer this
this<00:03:23.400> double<00:03:23.760> diamond<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.540> rig<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.990> this

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
this double diamond on a rig like this

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.210 
this double diamond on a rig like this
you're<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.440> trying<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.770> create<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.130> much

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
you're just trying to create as much

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.620 
you're just trying to create as much
vibration<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.000> what<00:03:27.180> gets<00:03:27.300> those<00:03:27.450> fish

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
vibration that's what gets those fish

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.970 
vibration that's what gets those fish
attention<00:03:28.110> then<00:03:28.230> they<00:03:28.320> look<00:03:28.530> up<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.860> they<00:03:28.950> see

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
attention then they look up and they see

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.270 
attention then they look up and they see
a<00:03:29.459> big<00:03:30.030> school<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.330> fish<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.650> take<00:03:32.130> this

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
a big school of fish so I take this

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.340 
a big school of fish so I take this
double<00:03:32.520> dollar<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.780> I'll<00:03:33.870> take<00:03:34.020> my<00:03:34.140> scissors

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
double dollar and I'll take my scissors

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.400 
double dollar and I'll take my scissors
and<00:03:35.630> typically<00:03:36.630> if<00:03:36.720> I'm<00:03:36.810> rigging<00:03:36.990> around<00:03:37.230> jig

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
and typically if I'm rigging around jig

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.900 
and typically if I'm rigging around jig
head<00:03:37.530> I'd<00:03:37.650> like<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.980> cut<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.250> right<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.700> does<00:03:38.850> a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
head I'd like to cut it right it does a

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.670 
head I'd like to cut it right it does a
little<00:03:39.090> line<00:03:39.540> right<00:03:39.570> there<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.320> I'll<00:03:40.440> go<00:03:40.530> back

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
little line right there but I'll go back

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.170 
little line right there but I'll go back
a<00:03:40.740> little<00:03:41.040> bit<00:03:41.220> further<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.820> I'll<00:03:41.940> tell<00:03:42.120> you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
a little bit further and I'll tell you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.560 
a little bit further and I'll tell you
why

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
why

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.600 
why
when<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.200> clip<00:03:43.470> off<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.770> tip<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.370> tip

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
when you clip off that tip that tip

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.850 
when you clip off that tip that tip
you've<00:03:45.360> got<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> really<00:03:45.750> big<00:03:46.110> flat<00:03:46.410> surface<00:03:46.830> to

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
you've got a really big flat surface to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.420 
you've got a really big flat surface to
work<00:03:47.130> with

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
work with

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.910 
work with
and<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.870> allows<00:03:49.110> for<00:03:49.320> your<00:03:49.410> bait<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.680> stay<00:03:49.830> on

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and that allows for your bait to stay on

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.130 
and that allows for your bait to stay on
your<00:03:50.070> hook<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.280> whole<00:03:50.400> lot<00:03:50.550> better<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.080> I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
your hook a whole lot better so then I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.170 
your hook a whole lot better so then I
just<00:03:52.320> hook<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.500> right<00:03:52.530> down<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.830> middle<00:03:53.180> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
just hook it right down the middle and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.690 
just hook it right down the middle and
I'll<00:03:54.300> slide<00:03:54.600> it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.830 

and<00:04:00.700> just<00:04:00.880> thread<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.150> right<00:04:01.390> up<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.720> back

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
and just thread it right up on the back

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.380 
and just thread it right up on the back
of<00:04:01.990> that<00:04:02.020> jig<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:03.550> push<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.880> over<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.090> barb

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
of that jig just push it over that barb

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.040 
of that jig just push it over that barb
let<00:04:04.750> hook<00:04:04.990> keep<00:04:05.170> bait<00:04:05.440> keeper<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.780> I'll<00:04:07.960> look

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
let hook keep bait keeper and I'll look

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.620 
let hook keep bait keeper and I'll look
something<00:04:08.380> like<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:09.670> know<00:04:09.790> rig<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.150> yeah

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
something like that you know rig up yeah

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.760 
something like that you know rig up yeah
obviously<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:11.050> got<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.200> rig<00:04:11.290> up<00:04:11.380> five<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.620> them

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
obviously you got to rig up five of them

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.310 
obviously you got to rig up five of them
so<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:11.980> takes<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.190> little<00:04:12.310> bit<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.520> time<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.320> I

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
so it takes a little bit of time so I

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.810 
so it takes a little bit of time so I
would<00:04:14.440> definitely<00:04:14.830> recommend<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.370> while

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
would definitely recommend it while

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.850 
would definitely recommend it while
you're<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.090> garage<00:04:16.709> talking<00:04:17.709> about

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
you're in the garage talking about

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.170 
you're in the garage talking about
fishing<00:04:18.070> with<00:04:18.280> your<00:04:18.400> buddies<00:04:18.670> before<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.060> get

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
out there once you rig up five of these

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.040 
out there once you rig up five of these
you<00:04:23.920> just<00:04:24.040> start<00:04:24.310> casting<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.870> is

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050

new<00:04:27.730> people<00:04:27.910> into<00:04:28.240> fishing<00:04:29.670> you<00:04:30.670> really<00:04:30.880> can't

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
new people into fishing you really can't

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.980 
new people into fishing you really can't
go<00:04:31.180> wrong<00:04:31.210> with<00:04:31.540> it

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
go wrong with it

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.660 
go wrong with it
you<00:04:32.500> just<00:04:32.680> cast<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.040> out<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.310> start<00:04:33.520> reeling

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
you just cast it out and start reeling

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.460 
you just cast it out and start reeling
it<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:34.210> once<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.110> pull<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.290> out<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.410> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
it in once you pull it out of the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.170 
it in once you pull it out of the
package<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.830> know<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.670> got<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.880> tickets

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
package you know and you got the tickets

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.080 
package you know and you got the tickets
you<00:04:37.240> want<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.450> spread<00:04:37.660> each<00:04:37.840> arm<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.940> want

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
you want to spread each arm and you want

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.550 
you want to spread each arm and you want
to<00:04:40.150> spread<00:04:40.390> them<00:04:40.510> just<00:04:41.020> far<00:04:41.230> enough<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.470> they

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
to spread them just far enough so they

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.930 
to spread them just far enough so they
don't<00:04:41.590> get<00:04:41.800> tangled<00:04:41.980> up<00:04:42.190> every<00:04:42.430> cast<00:04:42.640> but<00:04:42.850> you

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
don't get tangled up every cast but you

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.890 
don't get tangled up every cast but you
want<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.180> keep<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.360> kind<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.540> close<00:04:43.720> together

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
want to keep it kind of close together

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.240 
want to keep it kind of close together
because<00:04:44.380> that's<00:04:44.560> what<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> school<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.130> bait

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
because that's what the school of bait

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.420 
because that's what the school of bait
fish<00:04:45.280> looks<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.420> in<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.600> water<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.430> then

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
fish looks like in the water and then

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.070 
fish looks like in the water and then
once<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.640> get<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.850> fully<00:04:49.030> rigged<00:04:49.270> up<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.960> you

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
once you get it fully rigged up and you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.360 
once you get it fully rigged up and you
get<00:04:53.230> out<00:04:53.320> there<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.560> cast<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.980> if<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.160> start
