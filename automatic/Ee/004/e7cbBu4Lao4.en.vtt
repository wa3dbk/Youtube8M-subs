of<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.689> time<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.680> we'll<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> put<00:01:29.189> in

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
of all time so we'll get this put in

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
of all time so we'll get this put in
here<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.759> almost<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> then

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
here it's almost like this and then

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.810 
here it's almost like this and then
check<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:33.350> goes<00:01:34.350> backwards<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.670> we'll

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
check it out goes backwards so we'll

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.230 
check it out goes backwards so we'll
flip<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> around<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.240> we'll
