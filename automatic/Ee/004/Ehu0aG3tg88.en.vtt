letting me Lord up any games and the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
letting me Lord up any games and the
current<00:00:16.379> test<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> build<00:00:16.980> probably

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
current test that the build probably

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.769 
current test that the build probably
won't<00:00:17.910> let<00:00:18.090> me<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.330> from<00:00:18.510> them<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> little

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
won't let me do it from them a little

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.580 
won't let me do it from them a little
while<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.789> yeah<00:00:20.840> it's<00:00:21.840> unfortunate<00:00:22.410> cuz<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
while and yeah it's unfortunate cuz I

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.730 
while and yeah it's unfortunate cuz I
want<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.980> show<00:00:23.130> off<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:23.460> things<00:00:23.760> but

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
want to get to show off these things but

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.900 
want to get to show off these things but
all<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.340> moment<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.760> this

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
all I can see at the moment as this

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.720 
all I can see at the moment as this
thing<00:00:27.150> basically<00:00:27.359> plays<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:28.730> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
thing basically plays like this then the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.190 
thing basically plays like this then the
new<00:00:30.740> Soviet<00:00:31.740> medium<00:00:32.700> tree<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.300> good<00:00:33.570> i<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.960> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
new Soviet medium tree is good i like it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 
new Soviet medium tree is good i like it
and<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:35.250> i<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.520> to10<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.210> probably<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and but i think the to10 is probably the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.049 
and but i think the to10 is probably the
best<00:00:37.020> thing<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.590> there's<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.820> tier

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
best thing about it there's the tier

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
best thing about it there's the tier
sevens<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.600> eights<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.899> all<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.730> anyway

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
sevens and eights are all right anyway

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.639 
sevens and eights are all right anyway
so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> realized<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.110> missed<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so I realized that I missed out on a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.670 
so I realized that I missed out on a
branch<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:45.559> VK<00:00:46.559> 30<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.789> 2m<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.559> think<00:00:49.559> there's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
branch that VK 30 or 2m I think there's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.279 
branch that VK 30 or 2m I think there's
another<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.039> that's<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.700> thank<00:00:51.000> you

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289
