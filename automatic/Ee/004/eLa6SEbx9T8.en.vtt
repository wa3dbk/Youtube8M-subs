Kentucky<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.460> really<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.789> only<00:02:04.910> way<00:02:05.180> they're

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
Kentucky the really the only way they're

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.520 
Kentucky the really the only way they're
going<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.539> do<00:02:05.690> that<00:02:05.899> is<00:02:06.080> through<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.320> program

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
going to do that is through a program

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.279 
going to do that is through a program
like<00:02:06.800> stick<00:02:07.310> head<00:02:07.520> where<00:02:07.820> they<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.959> chance

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
like stick head where they have a chance

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.110 
like stick head where they have a chance
to<00:02:09.560> go<00:02:09.709> out<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:10.039> all<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.280> recruiting<00:02:10.640> camps

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
to go out to all the recruiting camps

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.660 
to go out to all the recruiting camps
and<00:02:11.330> showcase<00:02:12.110> themselves<00:02:12.709> along<00:02:12.950> with<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.440 
and showcase themselves along with the
best<00:02:13.880> kids<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.330> state<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.440> think<00:02:16.010> that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
best kids in the state and I think that

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.740

their<00:03:25.030> life<00:03:25.330> from<00:03:25.630> from<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.930> time<00:03:26.170> they<00:03:26.350> join

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
their life from from the time they join

their life from from the time they join
us<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.370> time<00:03:27.610> we<00:03:27.790> send<00:03:28.390> them<00:03:28.540> off<00:03:28.660> to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
us to the time we send them off to

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.309 
us to the time we send them off to
school<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.350> think<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.160> value<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.600> we<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:32.019> add

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
school I think the value that we can add

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.559 
school I think the value that we can add
to<00:03:32.620> our<00:03:32.769> club<00:03:33.069> programs<00:03:33.580> is<00:03:33.819> what<00:03:34.030> separates

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
to our club programs is what separates

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.130 
to our club programs is what separates
us<00:03:34.840> from<00:03:34.900> from<00:03:35.319> everybody<00:03:35.830> else
