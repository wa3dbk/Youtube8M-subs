but it is doable it's workable to get a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.109 
but it is doable it's workable to get a
DNA<00:00:25.529> bomb<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:26.760> gonna<00:00:26.849> give<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.090> guys

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770 
it so with this map I recommend you guys
have<00:00:31.859> been<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.219> powerful<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:33.210> you're

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
gonna have really long range engagements

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.850 
gonna have really long range engagements
and<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.360> recommend<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.870> guys<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.290> toughness

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and I recommend you guys have toughness

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
and I recommend you guys have toughness
because<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.850> those<00:00:39.030> long<00:00:39.360> range

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
because with those long range

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.930 
because with those long range
engagements<00:00:39.930> toughness<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:41.340> help<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.790> out

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
engagements toughness will help you out

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.310 
engagements toughness will help you out
if<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.480> toughen<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> song<00:00:43.079> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
if you don't have toughen a song you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.080 
if you don't have toughen a song you
will<00:00:43.500> lose<00:00:43.739> those<00:00:44.129> long<00:00:44.460> range<00:00:44.820> engagements

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
will lose those long range engagements

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.869 
will lose those long range engagements
trust<00:00:45.989> me<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.980> hundred<00:00:47.250> percent<00:00:47.489> for

that and it will work so make sure you
guys<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.559> ahead<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> run<00:00:53.399> toughness<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.090> run

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
guys go ahead and run toughness and run

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.410 
guys go ahead and run toughness and run
a<00:00:54.420> very<00:00:54.899> great<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.260> awful<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> battle<00:00:56.850> 27

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
a very great so awful like the battle 27

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
a very great so awful like the battle 27
the<00:00:57.539> ak-12<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> ax<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.579> rear<00:00:59.730> exit<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the ak-12 or the ax and a rear exit is a

the ak-12 or the ax and a rear exit is a
very<00:01:00.359> good<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.719> awful<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.620> used

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
very good and so awful if you get used

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500 
very good and so awful if you get used
to<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> very<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.820> set<00:01:03.120> go<00:01:03.239> ahead<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to it it's a very be set go ahead and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
to it it's a very be set go ahead and
use<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:03.840> weapons<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.949> playing

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
use those weapons so when playing

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
use those weapons so when playing
domination<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.880> solar<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.840> guys<00:01:06.990> gotta

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
domination on solar what you guys gotta

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
domination on solar what you guys gotta
do<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.650> gotta<00:01:07.830> kill<00:01:08.100> them<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> flag<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
do you gotta kill them out to a flag and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.750 
do you gotta kill them out to a flag and
you<00:01:09.630> guys<00:01:09.750> spawn<00:01:10.200> trap<00:01:10.530> them<00:01:10.799> back<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you guys spawn trap them back here you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280 
you guys spawn trap them back here you
know<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.090> very<00:01:12.420> easy<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> control<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
know it's very easy to control the a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.920 
know it's very easy to control the a
spawns<00:01:13.740> i<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> spawns<00:01:15.540> are

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
spawns i think that the a spawns are

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.469 
spawns i think that the a spawns are
more<00:01:16.259> simple<00:01:16.860> than<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.340> sea<00:01:17.610> spawns<00:01:17.939> because

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
more simple than the sea spawns because

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.780 
more simple than the sea spawns because
the<00:01:18.689> sea<00:01:18.930> spawns<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.100> crazy<00:01:20.460> there's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the sea spawns can get crazy there's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.820 
the sea spawns can get crazy there's
cars<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.689> sea<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.590> cars

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
cars back there at sea and the cars

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
cars back there at sea and the cars
could<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.220> mess<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.909> blow<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.150> up

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
could just mess you up and blow you up

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.060 
could just mess you up and blow you up
because<00:01:24.509> some<00:01:24.869> people<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.229> game<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:26.009> do

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
because some people in this game they do

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
because some people in this game they do
run<00:01:26.460> grenades<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.240> could<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.540> throw

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
run grenades and they could just throw

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
run grenades and they could just throw
random<00:01:28.200> sticky<00:01:28.650> grades<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.220> top<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> car

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
random sticky grades on top of the car
