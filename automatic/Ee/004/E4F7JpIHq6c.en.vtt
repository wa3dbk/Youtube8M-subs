 sometimes impressive we already had

 seen here on the life of cats dot com 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.790
 what education programs each 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 kitten was receiving from her mom during 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.700
 first weeks and months at 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.579
 socialization component the mom on stage y 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 the art of playing by controlling his moves 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.939
 claws 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.399
 well- bred kittens play so paste 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.439
 soft self-control is not innate in 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.329
 the kitten that's why his mom has to 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.609
 teach him the basics of respect 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.409
 and even in the game and like kittens 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.840
 seek limits by provoking 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.060
 the maternal authority and well the mother 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.799
 she is forced to crack down and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.429
 sometimes strongly in some 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.130
 circumstances 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.539
 when we have to complete ourselves 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.939
 besides the education of kittens 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.009
 abandoned we often had what insures 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.990
 everyone's life as and we all 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.969
 the sentences of the world sometimes to make us 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.259
 to understand kittens it's true that 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.599
 kittens take the wrong 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.609
 used to scratch violently in full 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.590
 game session you must have known that 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.920
 organic moms are so very 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.169
 effective but they must sometimes use 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.119
 of their strength of their animal dominance 

00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:03.060
 to calm the most kittens 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.950
 turbulent personally I've already seen 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.450
 moms correct their little so 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.890
 strong that I could not help but 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.660
 to try to calm the game 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.510
 in a shelter and a behaviorist 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.770
 feline had explained to me that despite the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.780
 violence of certain scenes 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.510
 we had to trust moms 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.370
 certainly a kitten understand quickly to the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.290
 minus two times to the neck and then 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 others often insist 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.709
 be scolded as intruders and 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.290
 in the latter case I have already seen a 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.000
 mother hold her baby around during 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.280
 at least three minutes and I assure you 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.890
 that in this case there is a very long while 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.930
 by scolding +1 very strongly the little 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.819
 mewed to ask the urgency see 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.760
 pity and after three minutes 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.239
 including two long kick taken 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.730
 supported the little he spun snuggle 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.360
 in a corner of the room trying to 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.630
 catch one's breath 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.800
 good bah despite my worries I 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.540
 found in the evening 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.670
 the mother and her little accomplices 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.530
 as if nothing had happened 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.239
 behaviorist was right I had 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.380
 was scared for the little one but I had 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.080
 managed to hold me 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.100
 finally despite this very punishment 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.660
 violent one of the good views in 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.340
 any case is the mom did not have 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.510
 rejected her little name she had it 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.880
 corrected that's all so I kept that 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.150
 our interpretation of a scene or a 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.700
 behavior remains subjective and very 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.440
 impaired when we know badly especially not 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.750
 at all the fundamentals and the needs 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.160
 of the cat except one or two cases 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.769
 exceptional things I'm going to talk about 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.239
 also sounds a mom and her kitten 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.400
 live this crucial period of 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.140
 education then to prevent them 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.500
 be wild aggressive 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.870
 terrified or unsociable later the cat 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.760
 receives this very specific education 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.280
 from his mom so do not let yourself 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.290
 abuse by what you deem as act 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360
 violent mother against her kitten no 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.120
 the animal world to his methods it takes 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.549
 trust the cats for the case 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.739
 of the three cats of Cecilia the relationship 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.780
 electric between the mother nahla and her 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.160
 son eliott and natural because actually 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.850
 elliott has passed for a very long time 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.549
 the age of being educated educate and in the summer 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.650
 and it's true that at a time between 5 and 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.480
 11 months a kitten this fact rejected by his 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.690
 mom it's normal she's devoted 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.220
 to his little one has allocated to him his priority 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.410
 but now that's it he can 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.810
 to fend for yourself the separation 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.489
 can be violent if the kitten insists 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.280
 on everything and does not understand quickly 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.710
 after this period the mother and her son 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.750
 recognize each other but do not 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.670
 no more privileged relationships than 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.600
 between two other healthy adult cats 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.670
 unrelated 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.440
 besides, I observe the same relation 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.980
 indifferent between brothers and sisters 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.100
 adults 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.660
 so dear Cecile sinhala the mother 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.000
 sometimes assault elliott 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.570
 it's because at just a sacred 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.100
 damn character you have to assert yourself very 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.330
 loudly one in front of her actually for herself 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.130
 to enforce you explain to me 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.380
 besides that the newcomer ash 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.020
 only six months old defends his 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.430
 elliott boyfriend standing up in front of 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.260
 nadal to the character 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.460
 I remind you that all cats are 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.740
 different and have their own 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.050
 characters as we need so 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.620
 adapt to each cat and their 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.390
 temperament 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.419
 as a reminder, you can 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.800
 consult an article about authority over 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.169
 our cat on the life of cats points 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.760
 as in the whole Cecile I would say 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.200
 that the relationships between your cats are 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.240
 good despite some signs 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.830
 of aggression I say that because 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.330
 it takes him back from time to time 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.610
 other his three cats to sleep together 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.020
 on the same there is that it's a sign 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.640
 whatever the fights 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.150
 eventually his three cats found a 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.640
 compromise 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.690
 so you have cats euro Cecile 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.729
 look forward to this nice trio given 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.710
 maybe more callahan has there 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.990
 because she needs it she fears the 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.360
 competition and they do not respond 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.010
 especially that by aggression to ensure 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.570
 an anxious cat of nature you can 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.260
 use my recipe for 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.229
 chaze aggressively and also consider the 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.610
 calm in 100% natural that we only have 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.770
 have already introduced you to the lives of 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.380
 cats points like so avoid the 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.450
 risks of surprises for nahla and all 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.710
 will go for the best reassure you all 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.630
 the days of itt him what is the most 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.090
 beautiful of the world and following besides 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.440
 the attention of in your voice she in 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.810
 will be persuaded by force of 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.390
 two rehearsals and I'm going to 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.870
 present exceptional cases of 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.270
 kittens rejected by their mother and there I 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.200

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.970
 exceptional in the rest of the article
