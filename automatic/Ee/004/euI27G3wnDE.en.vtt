are in the extended carriages and then

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.820 
are in the extended carriages and then
there's<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.700> set<00:01:05.909> screw<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.619> for

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
there's a set screw that you use for

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.230 
there's a set screw that you use for
adjustments<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.939> nut<00:01:09.900> sits<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
adjustments the nut sits in here so that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.420 
adjustments the nut sits in here so that
you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.630> tighten<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.140> you'll<00:01:14.130> need<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you can tighten it up you'll need to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.170 
you can tighten it up you'll need to
screw<00:01:14.970> these<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.439> almost<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> whole<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
screw these out almost the whole way and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.039 
screw these out almost the whole way and
allow<00:01:18.180> yourself<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:18.630> room<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.220> then

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
allow yourself some room and then

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.270 
allow yourself some room and then
basically<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> looks<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.860> at

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
basically that's what it looks like at

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.450 
basically that's what it looks like at
that<00:01:23.490> point<00:01:24.860> another<00:01:25.860> thing<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.430> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
shorter screws here and what they are

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.860 
shorter screws here and what they are
used<00:02:12.300> for

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
used for

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.670

is<00:02:13.019> mounting<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> brushes<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:15.290> these<00:02:16.290> have

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
is mounting the brushes now these have

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.500 
is mounting the brushes now these have
been<00:02:16.830> powder-coated<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.879> you're<00:02:18.269> probably

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
been powder-coated so you're probably

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.589 
been powder-coated so you're probably
best<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.379> go<00:02:19.590> ahead<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.340> rethread<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.090> bolts

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
best to go ahead and rethread the bolts

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.160 
best to go ahead and rethread the bolts
and<00:02:21.870> then<00:02:22.709> run<00:02:23.220> them<00:02:23.280> down<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> bottom<00:02:24.180> of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and then run them down to the bottom of

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.259 
and then run them down to the bottom of
the<00:02:25.349> thread<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> bolt<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.909> then<00:02:27.090> take

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
the thread on the bolt and then take

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.430 
the thread on the bolt and then take
them<00:02:27.390> back<00:02:27.540> out<00:02:27.750> again<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.170> clean<00:02:28.349> your

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
them back out again to clean your

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.180 
them back out again to clean your
threads<00:02:28.769> out<00:02:29.450> from<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:30.890> there's<00:02:31.890> also<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
threads out from there there's also a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.949 
threads out from there there's also a
little<00:02:32.459> box<00:02:32.670> with<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.060> brush<00:02:33.299> assemblies<00:02:33.810> in

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
little box with the brush assemblies in

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.229 
little box with the brush assemblies in
them<00:02:34.310> basically<00:02:35.310> they're<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.700> pieces<00:02:36.209> you

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
them basically they're in pieces you

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.800 
them basically they're in pieces you
have<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.900> piece<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.260> aluminum<00:02:37.709> extrusion<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.489> a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
have a piece of aluminum extrusion and a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.930 
have a piece of aluminum extrusion and a
cut<00:02:39.810> off<00:02:39.959> piece<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.440> brush<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.489> brush<00:02:41.700> then

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
cut off piece of brush the brush then

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
cut off piece of brush the brush then
slides<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.720> aluminum<00:02:43.110> extrusion<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
slides in the aluminum extrusion and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.130 
slides in the aluminum extrusion and
then<00:02:44.640> bolt<00:02:45.599> it<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> bottom<00:02:47.780> it'll<00:02:48.780> bolt<00:02:49.019> on

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
then bolt it to the bottom it'll bolt on

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.229 
then bolt it to the bottom it'll bolt on
like<00:02:49.349> this<00:02:49.560> from<00:02:49.680> underneath<00:02:49.879> it's<00:02:50.879> best<00:02:51.150> to

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
like this from underneath it's best to

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.420 
like this from underneath it's best to
put<00:02:51.450> these<00:02:51.629> on<00:02:51.870> prior<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.620> putting<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.040> risers

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
put these on prior to putting the risers

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.400 
put these on prior to putting the risers
on<00:02:53.609> because<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.420> extremely<00:02:54.810> difficult<00:02:55.079> to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
on because it's extremely difficult to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.339 
on because it's extremely difficult to
get<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:56.129> bolts<00:02:56.549> from<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.910> backside<00:02:57.420> once

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
get to the bolts from the backside once

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.309 
get to the bolts from the backside once
the<00:02:58.500> risers<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.069> on<00:02:59.190> unless<00:02:59.609> you<00:02:59.730> win<00:03:00.319> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
the risers are on unless you win the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.860 
the risers are on unless you win the
riser<00:03:01.560> assembly<00:03:02.069> off<00:03:02.359> you'll<00:03:03.359> also<00:03:03.540> probably

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
riser assembly off you'll also probably

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.890 
riser assembly off you'll also probably
want<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.260> use<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> couple<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:04.920> clamps<00:03:05.900> pretty

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
want to use a couple of clamps pretty

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.080 
want to use a couple of clamps pretty
much<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.049> must<00:03:07.379> if<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.709> want<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.980> try<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.340> get

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
much a must if you want to try and get

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.020 
much a must if you want to try and get
everything<00:03:09.379> secured<00:03:10.379> properly<00:03:10.829> now<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.879> is

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
everything secured properly now this is

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.839 
everything secured properly now this is
all<00:03:12.209> again<00:03:13.019> kind<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.739> temporary<00:03:14.310> until<00:03:14.640> we<00:03:14.730> get

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
all again kind of temporary until we get

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.089 
all again kind of temporary until we get
the<00:03:16.340> y-axis<00:03:18.200> extrusion<00:03:19.200> put<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.500> both<00:03:19.769> sides

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
the y-axis extrusion put on both sides

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.159 
the y-axis extrusion put on both sides
and<00:03:20.940> then<00:03:21.389> we<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.599> start<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.989> alignment

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
and then we can start the alignment

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.680 
and then we can start the alignment
process<00:03:22.760> these<00:03:23.760> basically<00:03:24.329> will<00:03:24.480> allow<00:03:24.630> you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
process these basically will allow you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.420 
process these basically will allow you
then<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.109> hold<00:03:25.590> these<00:03:25.709> together<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.250> tighten

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
then to hold these together and tighten

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.670 
then to hold these together and tighten
these<00:03:26.609> points<00:03:26.940> down<00:03:27.349> adjustments<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.440> course

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
these points down adjustments the course

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680 
these points down adjustments the course
can<00:03:28.799> be<00:03:28.889> made<00:03:29.040> underneath<00:03:29.519> if<00:03:30.419> you<00:03:30.540> have

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
can be made underneath if you have

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.930 
can be made underneath if you have
clearance<00:03:31.560> opening<00:03:32.129> underneath<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.669> makes<00:03:32.849> it

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
clearance opening underneath it makes it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.640 
clearance opening underneath it makes it
easier<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.239> give<00:03:33.419> that<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.840> set<00:03:34.379> screws

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
easier to give that the set screws

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.520 
easier to give that the set screws
there's<00:03:34.889> just<00:03:35.280> enough<00:03:35.609> room<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:37.049> get<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.349> there

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
there's just enough room to get in there

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.619 
there's just enough room to get in there
with<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> wrench<00:03:38.069> then<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:39.000> tighten<00:03:39.359> down<00:03:39.389> the

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
with a wrench then to tighten down the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.080 
with a wrench then to tighten down the
bolt<00:03:39.870> for<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.200> bottom<00:03:40.560> bearing<00:03:40.919> which<00:03:41.819> is<00:03:41.849> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
bolt for the bottom bearing which is the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.059 
bolt for the bottom bearing which is the
adjustable<00:03:42.599> bearing<00:03:45.109> again<00:03:46.109> this<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.410> pretty

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
adjustable bearing again this is pretty

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.839 
adjustable bearing again this is pretty
slug<00:03:47.489> snug<00:03:47.940> right<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:48.919> and<00:03:49.919> I<00:03:50.519> just<00:03:50.549> have

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
slug snug right now and I just have

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.259 
slug snug right now and I just have
these<00:03:50.970> clamps<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.449> here<00:03:51.629> for<00:03:52.230> show-and-tell

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
these clamps on here for show-and-tell

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.490 
these clamps on here for show-and-tell
and<00:03:54.269> they'll<00:03:54.510> probably<00:03:55.049> need<00:03:55.349> some

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
and they'll probably need some

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.559 
and they'll probably need some
adjustments<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.099> get<00:03:56.699> them<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.209> about<00:03:57.419> the

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
adjustments to get them just about the

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.099 
adjustments to get them just about the
right<00:03:57.720> tension<00:03:59.449> after<00:04:00.449> we<00:04:00.690> get<00:04:00.840> everything

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
right tension after we get everything

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.559 
right tension after we get everything
put<00:04:01.379> together<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.889> aligned<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.359> course

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
put together and aligned and of course

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.420 
put together and aligned and of course
then<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.199> rails<00:04:04.410> will<00:04:04.680> have<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.919> be<00:04:05.040> loosened

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
then the rails will have to be loosened

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.339 
then the rails will have to be loosened
so<00:04:05.579> that<00:04:05.730> we<00:04:05.819> can<00:04:05.970> work<00:04:06.120> from<00:04:06.299> one<00:04:06.720> end<00:04:06.930> over

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
so that we can work from one end over

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.479 
so that we can work from one end over
and<00:04:07.590> then<00:04:08.160> down<00:04:08.419> to<00:04:09.419> get<00:04:10.139> square<00:04:10.530> between<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
and then down to get square between the

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.559 
and then down to get square between the
two<00:04:13.760> only<00:04:14.760> other<00:04:14.940> thing<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.120> want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.359> mention

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
two only other thing I want to mention

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.900 
two only other thing I want to mention
at<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.780> time<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.410> got<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.650> remember<00:04:16.910> when

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
at this time you got to remember when

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.529 
at this time you got to remember when
you're<00:04:18.060> tightening<00:04:18.359> up<00:04:18.720> these<00:04:19.609> bolts<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.789> the

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
you're tightening up these bolts and the

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.779 
you're tightening up these bolts and the
extended<00:04:22.140> carriages<00:04:22.650> these<00:04:23.370> extended

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
extended carriages these extended

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.260 
extended carriages these extended
carriages<00:04:24.240> are<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.750> little<00:04:24.960> bit

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
carriages are a little bit

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.659 
carriages are a little bit
so<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:26.440> have<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.770> be<00:04:26.830> careful<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.550> don't

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
so you have to be careful that you don't

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.189 
so you have to be careful that you don't
over<00:04:28.060> tighten<00:04:28.210> them<00:04:28.389> otherwise<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.960> will

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
over tighten them otherwise you will

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.040 
over tighten them otherwise you will
strip<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.800> threads<00:04:29.830> out<00:04:30.340> my<00:04:31.240> suggestion

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
strip the threads out my suggestion

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.600 
strip the threads out my suggestion
would<00:04:32.229> be<00:04:32.289> you<00:04:32.860> bring<00:04:33.639> them<00:04:33.729> down<00:04:33.910> snug<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:35.610> go

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
would be you bring them down snug and go

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.809 
would be you bring them down snug and go
maybe<00:04:36.849> a<00:04:37.000> quarter<00:04:37.330> return<00:04:37.840> half<00:04:38.410> snug<00:04:39.039> once

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
maybe a quarter return half snug once

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.570 
maybe a quarter return half snug once
the<00:04:39.940> lock<00:04:40.120> washer<00:04:40.360> seats<00:04:40.900> just<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:42.280> make<00:04:42.550> sure

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
the lock washer seats just to make sure

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.610 
the lock washer seats just to make sure
you<00:04:42.819> have<00:04:43.000> enough<00:04:43.330> just<00:04:44.080> enough<00:04:44.319> torque<00:04:44.590> to

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
you have enough just enough torque to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.490 
you have enough just enough torque to
hold<00:04:44.949> them<00:04:45.099> in<00:04:45.190> place<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.720> lock<00:04:46.900> washers<00:04:47.319> will

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
hold them in place the lock washers will

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.680 
hold them in place the lock washers will
keep<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.770> from<00:04:47.919> spinning<00:04:48.509> but<00:04:49.509> if<00:04:49.599> you

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
keep you from spinning but if you

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.089 
keep you from spinning but if you
overtook<00:04:50.080> them<00:04:50.259> you're<00:04:50.530> probably<00:04:50.770> going<00:04:51.039> to

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
overtook them you're probably going to

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.100 
overtook them you're probably going to
strip<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.550> threads<00:04:51.580> out<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:52.630> just<00:04:52.840> be<00:04:52.930> careful

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
strip the threads out so just be careful

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.350 
strip the threads out so just be careful
with<00:04:53.380> that<00:04:53.440> whenever<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:54.190> do<00:04:54.759> your<00:04:54.940> assembly

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
with that whenever you do your assembly

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.490 
with that whenever you do your assembly
so<00:04:56.460> at<00:04:57.460> this<00:04:57.550> point<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.990> going<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.169> go<00:04:59.259> ahead

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
so at this point I'm going to go ahead

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.379 
so at this point I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:59.650> finish<00:04:59.860> putting<00:05:00.550> on<00:05:00.759> the<00:05:00.849> other<00:05:00.970> gantry

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
and finish putting on the other gantry

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.980 
and finish putting on the other gantry
riser<00:05:01.659> and<00:05:02.050> then<00:05:02.740> we'll<00:05:02.979> work<00:05:03.159> on<00:05:03.370> getting<00:05:03.400> the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
riser and then we'll work on getting the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.140 
riser and then we'll work on getting the
y-axis<00:05:04.990> extrusion<00:05:05.590> crossmember<00:05:06.190> put<00:05:06.400> on<00:05:06.520> and

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
y-axis extrusion crossmember put on and

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.059 
y-axis extrusion crossmember put on and
we'll<00:05:07.539> take<00:05:07.659> it<00:05:07.720> from<00:05:07.900> there<00:05:07.990> thanks<00:05:08.949> for

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
we'll take it from there thanks for

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.370 
we'll take it from there thanks for
