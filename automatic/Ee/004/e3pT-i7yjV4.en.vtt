00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
stone in but to get it really looking

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.080 
stone in but to get it really looking
good<00:04:45.300> you'd<00:04:45.870> want<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.140> burnish<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.620> after<00:04:46.950> this

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
so I'm pushing down any high points kind

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.560 
so I'm pushing down any high points kind
of<00:04:52.850> making<00:04:53.850> sure<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.380> top<00:04:55.380> edge<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:56.570> rounded

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
of making sure that top edge is rounded

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.350 
of making sure that top edge is rounded
and<00:04:57.600> smoothed<00:04:58.080> over<00:04:59.000> again<00:05:00.000> without

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
and smoothed over again without

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.140 
and smoothed over again without
scratching<00:05:00.780> my<00:05:01.140> stone<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.740> if<00:05:02.700> you<00:05:02.850> do<00:05:02.970> want

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
scratching my stone and if you do want

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.240 
scratching my stone and if you do want
to<00:05:03.180> cover<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.570> some<00:05:04.170> some<00:05:04.620> blue<00:05:04.830> painters<00:05:05.190> tape

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
to cover it some some blue painters tape

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.820 
to cover it some some blue painters tape
like<00:05:05.670> this<00:05:05.880> over<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.840> top<00:05:07.020> or<00:05:07.260> masking<00:05:07.680> tape

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
like this over the top or masking tape

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.170 
like this over the top or masking tape
works<00:05:08.070> really<00:05:08.280> well<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.700> just<00:05:08.850> kind<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.030> give<00:05:09.150> a

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
works really well to just kind of give a

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.990 
works really well to just kind of give a
little<00:05:09.390> protective<00:05:09.690> layer
