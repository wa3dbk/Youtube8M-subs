bothered me the past two years is the
map<00:00:30.179> design<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.410> thing<00:00:31.529> you'll

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
map design now the one thing you'll

notice<00:00:31.830> from<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.160> game<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.969> am

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
notice from this game is that I am

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.920 
notice from this game is that I am
lagging<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:34.140> crazy<00:00:35.210> like<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
lagging like crazy like that when I the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.360 
lagging like crazy like that when I the
last<00:00:37.079> guy<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> killed<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.010> back<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
last guy I killed you can go back and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.220 
last guy I killed you can go back and
watch<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:39.120> started<00:00:39.570> reloading

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
watch it I actually started reloading

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
watch it I actually started reloading
before<00:00:40.530> he<00:00:40.590> died<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:41.280> lagging

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
before he died because I was lagging

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.930 
before he died because I was lagging
that<00:00:41.879> bad<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.600> still<00:00:43.050> managed<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.980> very

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that bad and I still managed to do very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.779 
that bad and I still managed to do very
well<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:46.050> well<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.309> reason<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
well very well and the reason for that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.930 
well very well and the reason for that
is<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.090> black<00:00:48.780> ops<00:00:49.050> 1<00:00:49.200> had<00:00:50.010> incredibly

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
is because black ops 1 had incredibly

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.080 
is because black ops 1 had incredibly
good<00:00:51.239> maps<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.840> maps<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:53.340> old<00:00:53.670> call<00:00:53.969> of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
good maps the maps in the old call of

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090 
good maps the maps in the old call of
duties<00:00:54.360> were<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.110> good<00:00:55.379> people<00:00:55.680> don't<00:00:55.800> like

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
duties were so good people don't like

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
duties were so good people don't like
like<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.149> best<00:00:57.360> some<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> best<00:00:57.930> maps<00:00:58.230> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
like the best some of the best maps in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470 
like the best some of the best maps in

design<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:06.000> missed<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> missed

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
design and I really missed that I missed

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
design and I really missed that I missed
the<00:01:07.020> mat<00:01:07.229> design<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:07.710> made<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> great

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the mat design they made a lot of great

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
the mat design they made a lot of great
strides<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.750> call<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> duty's<00:01:10.439> over<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
strides with the call of duty's over the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520 
strides with the call of duty's over the
years<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.060> regressed<00:01:12.570> horribly

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
years but they have regressed horribly

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.670 
years but they have regressed horribly
in<00:01:13.830> map<00:01:14.189> design<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.790> i<00:01:15.659> miss<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> maps<00:01:16.560> where

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
in map design and i miss the maps where

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.550 
in map design and i miss the maps where
you<00:01:16.799> could<00:01:16.920> play<00:01:17.250> smart<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:19.080> smart

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
taking out quips quickscoping so that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450 
taking out quips quickscoping so that
actually<00:01:40.049> gives<00:01:40.170> me<00:01:40.409> some<00:01:40.560> hope<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.920> call<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
actually gives me some hope in call of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.800 
actually gives me some hope in call of
duty<00:01:41.579> ghosts<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.180> they're<00:01:42.299> gonna<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.630> out

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
duty ghosts if they're gonna take out

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
all and in my opinion black ops 1 is is

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.199 
all and in my opinion black ops 1 is is
probably<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.859> best<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.310> my<00:03:11.459> favorite<00:03:11.849> FPS
