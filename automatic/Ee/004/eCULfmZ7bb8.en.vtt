investigator to learn more the idea
behind<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.520> study<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.270> collect<00:00:43.370> motion

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
behind the study was to collect motion

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.670 
behind the study was to collect motion
capture<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.060> ground<00:00:45.720> reaction<00:00:45.990> force<00:00:46.380> data

from astronauts as they exercise on the
space<00:00:49.380> station<00:00:49.520> Norder<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.940> order<00:00:51.150> for<00:00:51.270> us

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
space station Norder so in order for us

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.060 
space station Norder so in order for us
to<00:00:51.540> be<00:00:51.750> able<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.990> quantify<00:00:52.170> these<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.950> then

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to be able to quantify these and then

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.950 
to be able to quantify these and then
compare<00:00:53.490> those<00:00:53.730> motions<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.690> how<00:00:54.810> they're

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
compare those motions to how they're

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.780 
compare those motions to how they're
performed<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.590> earth<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.460> how<00:00:56.610> did<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
performed on earth so how did it

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.670 
performed on earth so how did it
actually<00:00:56.910> work<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.630> station<00:00:58.080> it<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.650> very

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
actually work on station it was very

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
actually work on station it was very
simple<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.310> all<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> wanted<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.240> was

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
simple actually all we wanted to do was

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.050 
simple actually all we wanted to do was
capture<00:01:00.710> data<00:01:01.710> during<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.370> actual<00:01:02.550> exercise

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
capture data during an actual exercise

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.299 
capture data during an actual exercise
session<00:01:03.540> for<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> astronauts<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.949> collected

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
session for the astronauts we collected

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.640 
session for the astronauts we collected
data<00:01:05.339> six<00:01:05.820> times<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.570> each<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.990> our<00:01:07.110> subjects

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
data six times from each of our subjects

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.590 
data six times from each of our subjects
and<00:01:07.860> essentially<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:08.880> did<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.060> place<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and essentially all they did was place a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.540 
and essentially all they did was place a
video<00:01:09.930> camera<00:01:10.230> up<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.800> view<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.100> side<00:01:11.310> while

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
video camera up to view the side while

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.850 
video camera up to view the side while
they<00:01:11.730> performed<00:01:12.510> their<00:01:12.540> exercise<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they performed their exercise and the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
they performed their exercise and the
treadmill<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> space<00:01:15.120> station

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
treadmill that's on the space station

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
treadmill that's on the space station
automatically<00:01:16.140> captures<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.190> ground

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
automatically captures the ground

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
automatically captures the ground
reaction<00:01:17.640> force<00:01:18.000> data<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.050> would<00:01:19.170> down

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
reaction force data so we would down

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.080 
reaction force data so we would down
link<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> video<00:01:19.800> data<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> ground

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
link the video data down like the ground

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.700 
link the video data down like the ground
reaction<00:01:21.330> force<00:01:21.690> data<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.530> would

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
reaction force data and then we would

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
reaction force data and then we would
start<00:01:23.010> computing<00:01:23.940> what<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> peak<00:01:24.840> forces

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
start computing what the peak forces

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.570 
start computing what the peak forces
were<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:25.620> what<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> joint<00:01:26.070> motion<00:01:26.250> patterns

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
were and what the joint motion patterns

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.630 
were and what the joint motion patterns
were<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:27.750> straightforward<00:01:28.490> how<00:01:29.490> many

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
were it's very straightforward how many

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
were it's very straightforward how many
subjects<00:01:29.970> did<00:01:30.120> you<00:01:30.299> end<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.260> had

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
subjects did you end up with we had

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
subjects did you end up with we had
eight<00:01:31.710> subjects<00:01:32.250> seven<00:01:32.580> males<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.090> one

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
eight subjects seven males and one

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.620 
eight subjects seven males and one
female<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> tell<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.549> results<00:01:36.030> yet<00:01:36.210> do

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
female so tell me we have results yet do

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
female so tell me we have results yet do
have<00:01:36.780> results<00:01:37.229> there's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> couple<00:01:38.010> things

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
have results there's a couple things

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
have results there's a couple things
that<00:01:38.850> are<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.090> interesting<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that are very interesting first is that

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
that are very interesting first is that
the<00:01:41.130> running<00:01:41.430> style<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> running<00:01:42.450> motion

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the running style or the running motion

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.620 
the running style or the running motion
that<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.140> use<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.710> space<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.430> pretty<00:01:45.180> much<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that we use in space is pretty much the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.480 
that we use in space is pretty much the
exact<00:01:45.990> same<00:01:46.170> running<00:01:46.470> motion<00:01:46.650> that<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.070> use<00:01:47.310> on

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
exact same running motion that we use on

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.000 
exact same running motion that we use on
the<00:01:47.640> ground<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.540> people<00:01:48.840> run<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.440> zero<00:01:49.950> gravity

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
the ground so people run in zero gravity

the same as they run in one gravity even

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.590 
the same as they run in one gravity even
though<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.310> wear<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> harness<00:01:53.760> and<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
and on the surface that maybe eight so

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.740

what<00:01:58.890> well<00:01:59.310> there's<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> big<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.060> wyd<00:02:00.299> first<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
what well there's a big so wyd first of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.440 
what well there's a big so wyd first of
all<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.110> exercise<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.830> they<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.369> earth

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
all the exercise that they do on earth

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
all the exercise that they do on earth
we<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.689> say<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.200> way<00:02:04.409> they're<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
we can say that the way they're going to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.530 
we can say that the way they're going to
move<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.070> space<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> same<00:02:06.270> so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
move in space is going to be the same so

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900 
move in space is going to be the same so
we<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.900> start<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:08.159> better<00:02:08.399> confidence

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
we can start to have better confidence

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.350 
we can start to have better confidence
that<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> way<00:02:09.630> we<00:02:09.780> exercise<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.130> way<00:02:11.250> we

older lists that rely on gravity these
data<00:02:25.910> suggest<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.690> either<00:02:27.200> when<00:02:27.770> we're<00:02:27.950> in

data suggest that either when we're in
zero<00:02:28.310> gravity<00:02:28.370> we<00:02:29.090> turn<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.570> information

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
zero gravity we turn that information

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.650 
zero gravity we turn that information
off<00:02:30.410> or<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.250> override<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.300> not<00:02:32.450> an

off or we override it so it's not an

off or we override it so it's not an
important<00:02:33.170> control<00:02:33.470> mechanism<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.670> think

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
important control mechanism and I think

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.580 
important control mechanism and I think
for<00:02:35.090> people<00:02:35.240> studying<00:02:35.720> how<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.140> brain<00:02:36.530> works

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
for people studying how the brain works

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.980 
for people studying how the brain works
and<00:02:37.190> how<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.370> brain<00:02:37.610> controls<00:02:37.820> motion<00:02:38.480> this

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
and how the brain controls motion this

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.440 
and how the brain controls motion this
is<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> really<00:02:39.500> big<00:02:39.760> study<00:02:40.760> or<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> really<00:02:41.330> big

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
is a really big study or a really big

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.870 
is a really big study or a really big

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
at how gravity affects motion have

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.330 
at how gravity affects motion have
really<00:02:47.690> been<00:02:47.870> focusing<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.410> smaller<00:02:48.800> motions

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
really been focusing on smaller motions

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.920 
really been focusing on smaller motions
like<00:02:49.490> reaching<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.060> grabbing<00:02:50.240> something<00:02:50.690> and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
like reaching and grabbing something and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.300 
like reaching and grabbing something and
this<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> only<00:02:51.350> time<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.710> we<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.070> a

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
this is the only time that we have a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.510 
this is the only time that we have a
large-scale<00:02:53.240> amount<00:02:53.990> of<00:02:54.110> data<00:02:54.350> with<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.220> pretty

bring<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.660> hundred-thousand-dollar<00:03:29.660> motion

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
bring a hundred-thousand-dollar motion

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.600 
bring a hundred-thousand-dollar motion
capture<00:03:30.500> system<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.980> where<00:03:31.130> they're<00:03:31.310> doing

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
capture system to where they're doing

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.949 
capture system to where they're doing
their<00:03:31.730> data<00:03:31.910> collection<00:03:32.390> they<00:03:32.480> could<00:03:32.660> do<00:03:32.780> what

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
their data collection they could do what

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.040 
their data collection they could do what
we<00:03:32.989> did<00:03:33.350> for<00:03:34.010> sports<00:03:34.880> or<00:03:35.180> for<00:03:35.480> rehab<00:03:35.840> or

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
we did for sports or for rehab or

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.720 
we did for sports or for rehab or
anything<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.130> we've<00:03:37.550> developed

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
anything like that so we've developed

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.010 
anything like that so we've developed
some<00:03:37.910> methodologies<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.570> could<00:03:38.810> be<00:03:38.900> useful

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
some methodologies that could be useful

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.320 
some methodologies that could be useful
for<00:03:39.230> people<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.800> ground<00:03:40.209> anything<00:03:41.209> else

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
for people on the ground anything else

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.640 
for people on the ground anything else
you<00:03:41.420> want<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.570> say<00:03:41.630> about<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.900> yeah<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.470> ground

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
you want to say about it yeah the ground

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.020 
you want to say about it yeah the ground
reaction<00:03:42.890> force<00:03:43.280> data<00:03:43.550> that's<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.940> other

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
reaction force data that's the other

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.160 
reaction force data that's the other
part<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:44.840> what's<00:03:45.019> really

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
part that this is what's really

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.070 
part that this is what's really
important<00:03:45.680> for<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.070> exercise<00:03:47.080> efficiency

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
important for the exercise efficiency

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.770 
important for the exercise efficiency
what<00:03:48.470> we<00:03:48.560> find<00:03:48.800> is<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.940> exercise<00:03:50.450> force

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
what we find is that the exercise force

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.509 
what we find is that the exercise force
is<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.290> get<00:03:51.410> in<00:03:51.560> zero<00:03:51.590> g<00:03:51.980> are<00:03:52.100> much<00:03:52.340> less

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
is that you get in zero g are much less

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.390 
is that you get in zero g are much less
than<00:03:52.820> 1g<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:53.690> they<00:03:53.810> increase<00:03:54.230> with<00:03:54.440> speed<00:03:54.739> so

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
than 1g but they increase with speed so

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.520 
than 1g but they increase with speed so
what<00:03:56.000> we<00:03:56.150> want<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.660> would<00:03:57.260> like<00:03:57.410> our

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
what we want and would like our

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.890 
what we want and would like our
astronauts<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.220> do<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.550> run<00:03:58.820> faster<00:03:59.330> if<00:03:59.510> we<00:03:59.570> can

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
astronauts to do is run faster if we can

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.300 
astronauts to do is run faster if we can
have<00:04:00.080> faster<00:04:00.530> running<00:04:00.739> maybe<00:04:01.040> they<00:04:01.250> do

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
have faster running maybe they do

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.250 
have faster running maybe they do
interval<00:04:02.239> training<00:04:02.269> where<00:04:02.690> they<00:04:02.720> run<00:04:02.959> fast

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
interval training where they run fast

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.440 
interval training where they run fast
and<00:04:03.500> rest<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.010> run<00:04:04.160> fast<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.610> rest<00:04:04.850> they<00:04:05.300> can

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
and rest and run fast and rest they can

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.940 
and rest and run fast and rest they can
get<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.600> better<00:04:05.810> response<00:04:06.200> for<00:04:06.620> their<00:04:06.739> bone

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
get a better response for their bone

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.550 
get a better response for their bone
growth<00:04:07.910> than<00:04:08.480> if<00:04:08.630> they<00:04:08.750> run<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.019> slower<00:04:09.350> speed

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
growth than if they run a slower speed

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.800 
growth than if they run a slower speed
for<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> longer<00:04:10.250> period<00:04:10.519> of<00:04:10.700> time<00:04:10.760> what's<00:04:11.660> the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
for a longer period of time what's the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.940 
for a longer period of time what's the
reaction<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.410> when<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.709> tell<00:04:12.860> an

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
reaction to that when you tell an

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.850 
reaction to that when you tell an
astronaut<00:04:13.340> run<00:04:13.519> faster<00:04:14.170> some<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.320> them<00:04:15.500> they

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
astronaut run faster some of them they

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.170 
astronaut run faster some of them they
think<00:04:16.459> that's<00:04:16.549> great<00:04:16.820> because<00:04:16.940> they're

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
think that's great because they're

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.060 
think that's great because they're
runners<00:04:17.450> some<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.870> them<00:04:18.019> maybe<00:04:18.709> aren't<00:04:18.950> so

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
runners some of them maybe aren't so

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.440 
runners some of them maybe aren't so
excited<00:04:19.580> because<00:04:19.669> that's<00:04:20.000> not<00:04:20.180> their

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
excited because that's not their

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.270 
excited because that's not their
favorite<00:04:20.660> sort<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.080> exercise<00:04:21.350> but<00:04:22.160> we're

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
favorite sort of exercise but we're

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.830 
favorite sort of exercise but we're
hoping<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.580> we<00:04:22.789> can<00:04:22.910> show<00:04:23.150> these<00:04:23.390> data<00:04:23.630> to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
hoping that we can show these data to

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.690 
hoping that we can show these data to
the<00:04:23.870> astronauts<00:04:24.410> now<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:24.890> instead<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.280> us<00:04:25.490> just

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
the astronauts now so instead of us just

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.310 
the astronauts now so instead of us just
saying<00:04:25.910> run<00:04:26.150> faster<00:04:26.570> because<00:04:26.720> we<00:04:26.960> think<00:04:27.110> it's

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
saying run faster because we think it's

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.760 
saying run faster because we think it's
good

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
good

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.189 
good
we<00:04:27.979> can<00:04:28.190> show<00:04:28.370> them<00:04:28.490> run<00:04:29.330> faster<00:04:29.750> because<00:04:29.960> we

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
we can show them run faster because we

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.189 
we can show them run faster because we
know<00:04:30.349> it's<00:04:30.500> good<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:32.000> if<00:04:32.660> you'd<00:04:32.750> like<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.930> find

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
know it's good and if you'd like to find

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.110 
know it's good and if you'd like to find
