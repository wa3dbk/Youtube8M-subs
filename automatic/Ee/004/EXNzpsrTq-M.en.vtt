00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.310
 hello everyone good a few hours ago 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.549
 we show a video in which 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.280
 we understood a lumia 930 totally 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.490
 off with a simple order of cortana 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.189
 specifically it was this terminal that 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.109
 good as you see one of the things that 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.140
 has is that it does not have a cortana anymore 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.080
 that is not updated 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.630
 a fort of hair but it does not even have the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.570
 denim lumia like this you will have 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.489
 guessed that it was all an innocent 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.890
 we hope with her we get a smile and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 how good you have found it funny 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 but we do not want to delay more and you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.190
 We will explain how as we did 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 for this we need this lune 930 and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.970
 a wireless charging base that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.010
 we have here what we did was 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.409
 simply cover the base with a cloth 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.579
 busted so you do not see notes start 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:56.510
 of the shape we place on top 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.170
 the phone and turn it off the base is 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.239
 disconnected 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.900
 we proceed to pay determine any 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.370
 we do now 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.290
 tell us see you later 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.700
 and once we want to turn it on once 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.380
 which is totally off as it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.039
 The only thing we do is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.079
 reconnect the base and as usual 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.180
 It takes about 7 seconds to show the 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.810
 logo of nokia then we hope a couple of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.399
 them and we gave and cut and you see that in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 nothing then begins to turn on 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.049
 start the afternoon on wire good 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.819
 that this is one of the bases of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.819
 wireless charging that has this 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:37.810
 led light around that good does the 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:40.630
 fabric so dense because it was not appreciated 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.040
 Well here you have it that is all not 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.720
 there was more trick and more mystery 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.240
 unfortunately, it is not a function 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.579
 that is to come or anything similar is 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.189
 just a little innocent that 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.770
 we have spent that we wait or have 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.929
 pulled out a smile and nothing too 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.539
 we take the opportunity to wish you a happy 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.259
