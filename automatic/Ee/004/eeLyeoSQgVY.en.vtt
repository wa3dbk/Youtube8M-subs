00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
between three to six months just because

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.639 
between three to six months just because
my<00:00:45.879> hair<00:00:46.149> is<00:00:46.179> naturally<00:00:46.780> wavy<00:00:46.809> has<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.350> little

my hair is naturally wavy has a little
bit<00:00:47.769> of<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.949> curl<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.399> it<00:00:48.429> so<00:00:49.589> what's<00:00:50.589> bad<00:00:50.800> about

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
bit of a curl to it so what's bad about

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.579 
bit of a curl to it so what's bad about
flat<00:00:51.219> irons<00:00:51.519> um<00:00:51.789> let's<00:00:52.480> see<00:00:52.600> they<00:00:53.140> cause<00:00:53.319> heat

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
flat irons um let's see they cause heat

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.169 
flat irons um let's see they cause heat
damage<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.129> your<00:00:54.219> hair<00:00:54.399> which<00:00:54.699> is<00:00:54.850> usually

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
damage to your hair which is usually

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.419 
damage to your hair which is usually
unavoidable<00:00:56.019> you<00:00:56.649> can<00:00:56.829> try<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.069> put<00:00:57.249> a<00:00:57.280> heat

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
unavoidable you can try to put a heat

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.069 
unavoidable you can try to put a heat
protectant<00:00:57.550> in<00:00:57.940> your<00:00:58.059> hair<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.480> try<00:00:58.539> to<00:00:58.659> buffer

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
protectant in your hair to try to buffer

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.689 
protectant in your hair to try to buffer
that<00:00:59.229> out<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.710> that's<00:01:00.129> probably<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.579> best

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
that out and that's probably the best

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.599 
that out and that's probably the best
you<00:01:00.940> can<00:01:01.089> do<00:01:01.269> for<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.479> then<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:03.010> else<00:01:03.190> is<00:01:03.370> bad

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
you can do for it then what else is bad

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.770 
you can do for it then what else is bad
about<00:01:03.760> them<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:04.120> they<00:01:04.300> have<00:01:04.479> mechanical

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
about them is that they have mechanical

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.750 
about them is that they have mechanical
damage<00:01:05.110> so<00:01:05.500> depending<00:01:06.010> on<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.159> type<00:01:06.370> of<00:01:06.400> flat

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
damage so depending on the type of flat

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.360 
damage so depending on the type of flat
iron<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.360> buy<00:01:07.570> it's<00:01:07.990> probably<00:01:08.620> better<00:01:09.070> if<00:01:09.159> you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
iron you buy it's probably better if you

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.530 
iron you buy it's probably better if you
buy<00:01:09.490> something<00:01:09.670> that<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:10.030> coated<00:01:10.510> with

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
buy something that is coated with

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.959 
buy something that is coated with
something<00:01:11.020> like<00:01:11.710> aluminum<00:01:12.340> or<00:01:12.579> a<00:01:12.610> hard

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
something like aluminum or a hard

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.969 
something like aluminum or a hard
ceramic<00:01:13.259> just<00:01:14.259> because<00:01:14.560> that<00:01:14.680> way<00:01:14.829> the

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
ceramic just because that way the

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.590 
ceramic just because that way the
chipping<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.610> coating<00:01:16.090> doesn't<00:01:16.360> wear

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
chipping and the coating doesn't wear

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.840 
chipping and the coating doesn't wear
off<00:01:16.829> so<00:01:17.829> that's<00:01:17.950> definitely<00:01:18.250> something<00:01:18.520> good

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
off so that's definitely something good

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.819 
off so that's definitely something good
it<00:01:19.060> puts<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.450> lot<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.630> shine<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.229> your<00:01:20.320> hair<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
it puts a lot of shine to your hair and

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.380 
it puts a lot of shine to your hair and
just<00:01:21.310> try<00:01:21.520> not<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:21.700> pull<00:01:21.969> it<00:01:22.090> all<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.210> way<00:01:22.299> to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
just try not to pull it all the way to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.760 
just try not to pull it all the way to
your<00:01:22.689> roots<00:01:22.899> because<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.289> can<00:01:23.409> be<00:01:23.439> very

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
your roots because it can be very

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.510 
your roots because it can be very
damaging<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:26.409> tip<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.680> flat<00:01:26.920> iron<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.340> I

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
damaging so the tip of flat iron that I

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.560 
damaging so the tip of flat iron that I
usually<00:01:27.939> use<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:29.320> cheap<00:01:29.799> so<00:01:30.490> this<00:01:30.880> is<00:01:31.149> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
usually use is a cheap so this is the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.109 
usually use is a cheap so this is the
original<00:01:31.689> G<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:32.649> bought<00:01:32.979> about<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.850> few

is<00:01:55.179> one<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.630> newer<00:01:55.840> cheese<00:01:56.640> what's<00:01:57.640> great

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
is one of the newer cheese what's great

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.370 
is one of the newer cheese what's great
about<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.210> was<00:01:58.359> they<00:01:58.539> were<00:01:58.630> able<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.869> fix<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.229> few

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
about it was they were able to fix a few

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.260 
about it was they were able to fix a few
things<00:01:59.409> about<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.920> design<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:01.149> were<00:02:01.240> a

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
things about the design that were a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.230 
things about the design that were a
little<00:02:01.390> bit<00:02:01.719> flawed<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:02.859> first<00:02:03.219> of<00:02:03.369> all<00:02:03.490> there

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
little bit flawed so first of all there

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.719 
little bit flawed so first of all there
was<00:02:04.390> an<00:02:04.479> on<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.869> off<00:02:04.929> switch<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:06.249> inside

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
was an on and off switch on the inside

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.609 
was an on and off switch on the inside
of<00:02:06.759> this<00:02:07.210> iron<00:02:07.479> which<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.899> unlike<00:02:08.259> hard<00:02:08.470> to

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
of this iron which is unlike hard to

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
of this iron which is unlike hard to
reach<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:08.950> between<00:02:09.250> there

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
reach in between there

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.620 
reach in between there
so<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.640> side<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.150> an

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
so now it is on the side and an

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.330 
so now it is on the side and an
excellent<00:02:12.840> also<00:02:13.230> has<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> temperature<00:02:13.890> setting

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
excellent also has a temperature setting

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.070 
excellent also has a temperature setting
which<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.760> turn<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.240> goes<00:02:15.630> anywhere<00:02:15.900> from

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
which you can turn it goes anywhere from

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.580 
which you can turn it goes anywhere from
a<00:02:16.230> hundred<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.830> eighty-two<00:02:18.230> 410<00:02:19.230> degrees

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a hundred and eighty-two 410 degrees

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.070 
a hundred and eighty-two 410 degrees
there<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.910> both<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.270> them<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> red<00:02:21.840> light

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
there so both of them have a red light

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.140 
there so both of them have a red light
that<00:02:22.530> turns<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.460> when<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> flick<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.030> on

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
that turns on when you flick it on

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.300 
that turns on when you flick it on
what's<00:02:24.810> great<00:02:24.930> about<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.260> cheers<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:26.130> is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
what's great about the cheers it is

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.760 
what's great about the cheers it is
actually<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.880> lot<00:02:27.180> lighter<00:02:27.540> than<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.380> old<00:02:28.560> one

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
actually a lot lighter than the old one

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.950 
actually a lot lighter than the old one
so<00:02:29.490> it's<00:02:29.760> definitely<00:02:30.120> something<00:02:30.360> when<00:02:30.780> you're

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
so it's definitely something when you're

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.230 
so it's definitely something when you're
using<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.530> lot<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.970> come

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
using it a lot and you have to come

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.540 
using it a lot and you have to come
continuosly<00:02:33.810> curling<00:02:34.440> your<00:02:34.470> hair<00:02:34.590> something

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
continuosly curling your hair something

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.310 
continuosly curling your hair something
it's<00:02:35.670> minor<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.150> lighter<00:02:36.360> what<00:02:37.080> else

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
it's minor that it's lighter what else

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320 
it's minor that it's lighter what else
is<00:02:37.530> great<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.040> they<00:02:38.790> made<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> better

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
is great is that they made a better

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.000 
is great is that they made a better
swivel<00:02:39.930> cord<00:02:40.050> for<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.740> when<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:40.980> are

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
swivel cord for it so when you are

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.100 
swivel cord for it so when you are
curling<00:02:41.400> your<00:02:41.520> hair<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.970> easier<00:02:42.450> turn<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
curling your hair is easier turn and

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.500 
curling your hair is easier turn and
twist<00:02:43.550> something<00:02:44.550> else<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.970> really<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.480> about

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
twist something else I really like about

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.620 
twist something else I really like about
the<00:02:45.960> new<00:02:46.140> one<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:48.150> cords<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:48.600> a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
the new one is that the cords are a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.120 
the new one is that the cords are a
little<00:02:48.780> bit<00:02:49.020> different<00:02:49.380> at<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> end<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
little bit different at the end for the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.030 
little bit different at the end for the
plugins<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:51.420> was<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.660> old<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.410> was<00:02:52.530> kind

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
plugins this was the old one it was kind

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.700 
plugins this was the old one it was kind
of<00:02:53.100> chunky<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.820> big<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:55.530> a

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
of chunky and big and now it's just a

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.400 
of chunky and big and now it's just a
normal<00:02:55.950> small<00:02:56.460> one<00:02:56.840> which<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.960> liked<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.260> lot

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
normal small one which I liked a lot

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.680 
normal small one which I liked a lot
about<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.760> definitely<00:03:00.120> something

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
about it so this is definitely something

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.900 
about it so this is definitely something
that<00:03:00.840> ever<00:03:01.170> recommend<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.250> definitely

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
something I use on a regular basis

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.670 
something I use on a regular basis
probably<00:03:10.320> about<00:03:10.980> four<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> seven<00:03:12.270> days<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> week

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
probably about four to seven days a week

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.140 
probably about four to seven days a week
so<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:13.920> definitely<00:03:14.459> something<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.970> thought
