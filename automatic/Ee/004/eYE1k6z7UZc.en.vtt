00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello everyone welcome to the channel with 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.950
 you today Sasha us sponge bob with you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.480
 so here we are spongebob rick 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.710
 yellow standard niki is made in 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.710
 square in style 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.090
 well let's talk about him 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 sweep sponge bob takes only 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
 one sheet we are not very many parts to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.789
 precisely details to shallow which is very 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.010
 convenient to scissor so 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.599
 it is desirable to cut the course with a knife 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.480
 because what kind of him 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.180
 thin hands thin legs all 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.370
 such a tiny little honestly say 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.890
 yes glue pens here it is these here 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.200
 hook and here these are just the legs 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 it would be complicated here would be toothpicks 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.480
 just not a costly toothpick 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.190
 and bent and glued you worse 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.200
 there was something to glue this here just in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.449
 the square was glue the top and bottom there 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.399
 because everything is flexed like this 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.160
 I always had the horror of all 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.530
 plus the devil bench made it in the morning 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 I just didn’t understand my head 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.289
 so long his business I don't know why 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.690
 hysterical 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.430
 I think that this is the legs of a man because 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
 that these legs are just the opposite, that is 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 so that there is white-blue was at the top in 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.840
 tom think it rub here that thought that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 legs there generally eventually found a picture in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.009
 The Internet case on the picture was determined 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.650
 something still legs and it's still arms 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.140
 there actually is a markup all here 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.540
 here is the bottom here where but the brains are all 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 marked with letters but on arms and legs 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.650
 they are so small that simple and 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.110
 well find out about the ship after glue and not at all 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.720
 distinguish therefore she could not distinguish 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.150
 where the hands and feet which is why you are all but 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.409
 you know it happens and so here 's 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.720
 here's a baba cup everything else basically 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.790
 besides the hand we make the bench just 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.590
 just that a lot of details are small here 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.360
 these are the sleeves little handles themselves 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.350
 caste stencil fun pen wild 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.970
 know square everything is unusual too 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.430
 these simple squares are made of it 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.600
 Pants are simple, rectangular. 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.689
 here are the boots 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.240
 despite his thin legs spongebob 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.500
 think about us so first think 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.079
 that he will not stand all because 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.969
 too thin legs and he and not 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.580
 will see a little different stand up 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.280
 lower 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.200
 crooked but in principle if there are some of them 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.540
 trim it even turns out exactly 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.700
 of these very thin legs she is all 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.800
 aligned but still look 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.620
 what are the legs that is because they are 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.170
 so here they are here as it should be exactly 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 Well, in principle, I think it does not matter how you 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.520
 know he is spongebob a long nose with us 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.830
 here they are so long here so he 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.230
 come out by the way see that the top is small 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.120
 the dent came out yes I know about my defect 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.590
 I think to define it below 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.900
 sides of the house will throw a dent 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.340
 thought no better dent on top like 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.680
 you will know and even naturally 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.500
 such as a spout, so here we are 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.140
 nose sizes spongebob if you 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.750
 interesting i'll say typing it on a4 sheet 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.810
 on a whole sheet well, so not the old 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.360
 gon child side leave 900 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.020
 with us, I think the legs are completely quite 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.370
 altogether 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.490
 in width literally two centimeters with us 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.410
 that is, it is quite small and 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.739
 what else is interesting to us what is interesting to us 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.780
 you believe it like this 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.660
 we have four and a half to 5 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.400
 centimeters we have so so here are 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.140
 Here it seems to me quite enough dimensions 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.670
 not bad by the way I do n’t know 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.720
 that he has such small legs and 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.330
 to help put on the glue and he is great him 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.160
 It is now worth it to show 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.840
 It stands on the glue that is, even in spite of 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.920
 you can put your little legs 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.709
 on such a surface 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.510
 the main thing is not to blow everything will be fine but 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.250
 worth love on this all sweep 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.930
 description under the video if you want 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.130
 make i such a sponge bob deal with 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.019
 pretty simple just what 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.300
