out<00:01:12.860> now<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.640> sets<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> shoe

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
out now one thing that sets the shoe

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
out now one thing that sets the shoe
apart<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.140> rest<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.340> don't<00:01:17.549> if

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
apart from the rest is that I don't if

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.340 
apart from the rest is that I don't if
you'd<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> light<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.170> shoe

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you'd see it in the light but this shoe

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.249 
you'd see it in the light but this shoe
has<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> rubbery<00:01:20.250> type<00:01:20.820> texture<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.750> think

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
has like a rubbery type texture I think

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.630 
has like a rubbery type texture I think
what<00:01:22.350> they<00:01:22.470> did<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:23.009> mesh<00:01:23.310> like

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
what they did is they got mesh like

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.289 
what they did is they got mesh like
engineered<00:01:24.090> mesh<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.970> don't

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
engineered mesh and then they I don't

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
engineered mesh and then they I don't
know<00:01:27.390> exactly<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.080> later<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> silicon<00:01:28.979> or

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
know exactly like later the silicon or

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.640 
know exactly like later the silicon or
like<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> silicone<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.240> top<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
like a silicone on top of this and it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
like a silicone on top of this and it
seems<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.850> durable<00:01:33.150> as

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
