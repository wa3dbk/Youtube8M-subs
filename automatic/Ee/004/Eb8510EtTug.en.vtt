series<00:00:08.530> what<00:00:09.519> grade<00:00:09.910> would<00:00:10.090> be<00:00:10.210> briefly<00:00:10.540> today

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
series what grade would be briefly today

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.630 
series what grade would be briefly today
it's<00:00:11.110> basically<00:00:11.470> how<00:00:11.740> an<00:00:11.890> attack<00:00:12.220> actually

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
it's basically how an attack actually

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.880 
it's basically how an attack actually
works<00:00:12.880> and<00:00:13.150> numb<00:00:13.510> also<00:00:14.350> I've<00:00:14.470> got<00:00:14.620> a<00:00:14.650> brief

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:14.890 
works and numb also I've got a brief

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.140 
works and numb also I've got a brief
look<00:00:15.070> at<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.250> map<00:00:15.490> it<00:00:15.730> which<00:00:15.880> we're<00:00:16.000> not<00:00:16.059> going

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
look at a map it which we're not going

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.599 
look at a map it which we're not going
to<00:00:16.299> get<00:00:16.359> to<00:00:16.570> advanced<00:00:17.080> into<00:00:17.410> as<00:00:17.590> you<00:00:18.310> can<00:00:18.430> see

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
to get to advanced into as you can see

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.550 
to get to advanced into as you can see
the<00:00:18.760> map<00:00:19.000> split<00:00:19.480> into<00:00:19.780> squares<00:00:20.140> which<00:00:20.380> are

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
the map split into squares which are

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.040 
the map split into squares which are
basically<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.190> size<00:00:21.460> of<00:00:21.820> a<00:00:22.030> hero<00:00:22.360> click<00:00:22.720> for

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
basically the size of a hero click for

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.290 
basically the size of a hero click for
each<00:00:23.110> square<00:00:23.470> they<00:00:24.160> say<00:00:24.369> workout<00:00:24.820> movements

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
each square they say workout movements

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.790 
each square they say workout movements
to<00:00:25.390> say<00:00:25.539> if<00:00:25.600> your<00:00:25.750> Hydra<00:00:26.110> soldier<00:00:26.529> here<00:00:26.710> I've

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
to say if your Hydra soldier here I've

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.040 
to say if your Hydra soldier here I've
got<00:00:26.830> who's<00:00:27.550> about<00:00:27.850> to<00:00:27.910> get<00:00:28.180> smashed<00:00:28.810> in<00:00:29.020> the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
got who's about to get smashed in the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.080 
got who's about to get smashed in the
face<00:00:29.140> but<00:00:29.470> Hulk<00:00:29.680> in<00:00:29.830> a<00:00:29.890> moment<00:00:30.279> but<00:00:30.400> he's<00:00:30.910> got

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
face but Hulk in a moment but he's got

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.910 
face but Hulk in a moment but he's got
movement<00:00:31.270> value<00:00:31.660> of<00:00:31.750> seven<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:32.320> ideally<00:00:32.859> if

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
movement value of seven so ideally if

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.680 
movement value of seven so ideally if
I'm<00:00:33.070> if<00:00:33.250> I'm<00:00:33.370> moving<00:00:33.820> my<00:00:33.850> soldier<00:00:34.390> he<00:00:34.480> can<00:00:34.600> move

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
I'm if I'm moving my soldier he can move

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.509 
I'm if I'm moving my soldier he can move
up<00:00:34.899> to<00:00:35.079> 7<00:00:35.379> squared<00:00:35.710> that's<00:00:35.920> in<00:00:36.100> any<00:00:36.280> direction

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
up to 7 squared that's in any direction

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.809 
up to 7 squared that's in any direction
so<00:00:37.510> i<00:00:37.539> can<00:00:37.719> moving<00:00:37.989> diagonally<00:00:38.819> vertically

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:39.819 
so i can moving diagonally vertically

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:41.189 
so i can moving diagonally vertically
straight<00:00:40.059> across<00:00:40.329> whatever<00:00:40.749> I<00:00:40.780> wanted<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.109> do

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
straight across whatever I wanted to do

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.680 
straight across whatever I wanted to do
up<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.530> seven<00:00:41.829> spaces<00:00:42.179> but<00:00:43.179> we're<00:00:43.300> not<00:00:43.329> reading

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
up to seven spaces but we're not reading

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.180 
up to seven spaces but we're not reading
into<00:00:43.809> movement<00:00:44.260> say<00:00:44.319> what<00:00:44.499> on<00:00:44.620> my<00:00:44.739> show<00:00:44.979> today

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
into movement say what on my show today

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.209 
into movement say what on my show today
is<00:00:45.370> how<00:00:45.639> the<00:00:45.699> attacks<00:00:46.120> actually<00:00:46.569> work<00:00:46.979> so<00:00:47.979> I'm

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
is how the attacks actually work so I'm

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.189 
is how the attacks actually work so I'm
going<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.729> bring<00:00:48.909> Hulk<00:00:49.179> in<00:00:49.449> pretty<00:00:49.780> close<00:00:50.049> to

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
going to bring Hulk in pretty close to

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.959 
going to bring Hulk in pretty close to
the<00:00:50.229> Hydra<00:00:50.620> soldier<00:00:51.069> who's<00:00:51.370> about<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.639> take<00:00:51.940> a

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
the Hydra soldier who's about to take a

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.989 
the Hydra soldier who's about to take a
really<00:00:52.420> nasty<00:00:52.629> punch<00:00:53.109> to<00:00:53.319> the<00:00:53.350> face<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.850> what

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
really nasty punch to the face so what

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.489 
really nasty punch to the face so what
happens<00:00:55.329> when<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.539> initiate<00:00:55.809> in<00:00:56.109> an<00:00:56.199> attack

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
happens when you initiate in an attack

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:58.439 
happens when you initiate in an attack
you're<00:00:57.429> going<00:00:57.549> to<00:00:57.609> take<00:00:57.789> your<00:00:57.819> characters

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
you're going to take your characters

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.209 
you're going to take your characters
attack<00:00:58.719> value<00:00:59.109> so<00:00:59.229> I'm<00:00:59.319> a<00:00:59.379> tackle<00:00:59.739> of<00:00:59.829> hulking

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
attack value so I'm a tackle of hulking

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.579 
attack value so I'm a tackle of hulking
it's<00:01:00.309> got<00:01:00.429> an<00:01:00.489> attack<00:01:00.699> value<00:01:01.089> of<00:01:01.209> 12<00:01:01.539> then<00:01:02.440> what

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
it's got an attack value of 12 then what

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.560 
it's got an attack value of 12 then what
you<00:01:02.679> need<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:02.979> do<00:01:03.100> next<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.909> need<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.150> roll<00:01:04.299> two

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
you need to do next you need to roll two

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.920 
you need to do next you need to roll two
dice<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.250> they<00:01:06.400> roll<00:01:06.610> two<00:01:06.790> six-sided<00:01:07.300> dice<00:01:07.600> bit

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
dice so they roll two six-sided dice bit

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.850 
dice so they roll two six-sided dice bit
I<00:01:08.550> rolled<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.790> six<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.300> A<00:01:10.390> one<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.590> that's<00:01:11.740> a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
I rolled a six and A one so that's a

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.190 
I rolled a six and A one so that's a
seven<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.340> add<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:13.030> your<00:01:13.060> attack<00:01:13.840> value

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
seven you add that to your attack value

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.800 
seven you add that to your attack value
of<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.380> base<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.130> hopes<00:01:15.790> on<00:01:16.030> attack<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.360> 12

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
of the base so hopes on attack of 12

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.990 
of the base so hopes on attack of 12
he's<00:01:17.620> rolled<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.950> seven<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.520> gives<00:01:18.730> him<00:01:18.850> an

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
he's rolled a seven that gives him an

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.810 
he's rolled a seven that gives him an
attack<00:01:19.270> value<00:01:19.630> out<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.810> 19<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:21.250> now<00:01:21.370> compare

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
attack value out of 19 you now compare

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.450 
attack value out of 19 you now compare
this<00:01:21.850> value<00:01:22.480> against<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.930> defense<00:01:23.290> value<00:01:23.560> if

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
this value against the defense value if

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.370 
this value against the defense value if
whoever<00:01:24.790> has<00:01:24.910> been<00:01:25.060> attacked<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.080> Hydra

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
whoever has been attacked and the Hydra

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.620 
whoever has been attacked and the Hydra
soldiers<00:01:26.560> only<00:01:27.070> got<00:01:27.190> 16<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.060> what<00:01:28.210> that<00:01:28.360> means

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
soldiers only got 16 so what that means

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.900 
soldiers only got 16 so what that means
he's<00:01:28.870> got<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.020> lower<00:01:29.340> defense<00:01:30.340> value<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
he's got a lower defense value and the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.060 
he's got a lower defense value and the
attacker<00:01:31.210> hope<00:01:31.510> Scott<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.680> means<00:01:32.890> that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
attacker hope Scott and that means that

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.890 
attacker hope Scott and that means that
the<00:01:33.310> soldiers<00:01:34.060> about<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.390> take<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.570> pretty

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
the soldiers about to take a pretty

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.310 
the soldiers about to take a pretty
nasty<00:01:35.140> punch<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.830> face<00:01:36.720> hopes<00:01:37.720> damage<00:01:38.200> is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
nasty punch to the face hopes damage is

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.980 
nasty punch to the face hopes damage is
actually<00:01:38.650> for<00:01:38.980> which<00:01:39.280> means<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:40.660> Hydra

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
actually for which means the Hydra

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.390
