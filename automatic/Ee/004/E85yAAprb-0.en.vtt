of<00:00:39.329> Chima<00:00:39.600> by<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.410> way<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.370> found<00:00:41.670> by

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
of Chima by the way this was found by

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.760 
of Chima by the way this was found by
the<00:00:42.840> Lego<00:00:43.079> pro<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.829> ly<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:45.320> yeah<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.559> was

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the Lego pro a ly I think yeah it was

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.029 
the Lego pro a ly I think yeah it was
and<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.940> says<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> picture<00:00:49.289> creating

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and it says in the picture creating

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
and it says in the picture creating
Chima<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.789> apparently<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> crocodiles

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
Chima so apparently it's the crocodiles

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.600 
Chima so apparently it's the crocodiles
and<00:00:52.910> what<00:00:53.910> looks<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.600> Lions<00:00:55.610> attacking

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and what looks like the Lions attacking

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849 
and what looks like the Lions attacking
each<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:57.050> however<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> look<00:00:58.500> inside

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
each other however if you look inside

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.970 
each other however if you look inside
there<00:00:59.789> they<00:01:00.149> look<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.449> masks<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.379> bit<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there they look like masks a bit and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.609

which<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.860> no<00:01:11.100> idea<00:01:11.549> why<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.960> quite

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
which I have no idea why but it's quite

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.700 
which I have no idea why but it's quite
interesting<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:14.159> looks<00:01:14.780> tropical<00:01:15.780> kind<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
interesting it looks tropical kind of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.170 
interesting it looks tropical kind of
and<00:01:17.150> um<00:01:18.150> most<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> crocodile<00:01:19.619> tribe

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
and um most of the crocodile tribe

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
and um most of the crocodile tribe
doesn't<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.509> weapons<00:01:22.200> made<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.560> bones
