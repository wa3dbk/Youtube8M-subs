then the speech recognition and I always
start<00:00:28.740> by<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.220> train<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:29.670> computer<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
start by going to train your computer to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.160 
start by going to train your computer to
better<00:00:30.750> understand<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:32.690> here<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> says<00:00:33.989> by

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
better understand you here it says by

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.540 
better understand you here it says by
listening<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.829> read<00:00:35.010> aloud<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
listening to you read aloud to the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.240 
listening to you read aloud to the
computer<00:00:36.030> speech<00:00:36.930> recognition<00:00:37.410> learns<00:00:38.010> how

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
computer speech recognition learns how

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
computer speech recognition learns how
you<00:00:38.309> speak<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.420> before<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> begin<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.260> just

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you speak so before I begin I'm just

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.869 
you speak so before I begin I'm just
going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> show<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> couple<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> sentences

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
going to show a couple of the sentences

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:42.950 
going to show a couple of the sentences
and<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> pause<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> video

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and then I'm going to pause the video

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
and then I'm going to pause the video
because<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.320> takes<00:00:43.559> around<00:00:43.770> three<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> five

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
because this takes around three to five

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.310 
because this takes around three to five
minutes<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> complete<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
minutes to complete so now I'm going to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.639 
minutes to complete so now I'm going to
click<00:00:46.440> Next<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.690> am<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.870> speaking<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> my

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
click Next I am now speaking to my

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.569 
click Next I am now speaking to my
computer<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:52.530> computer<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.129> learning<00:00:53.340> this

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
computer the computer is learning this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.709 
computer the computer is learning this
out<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.000> voice<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.719> speak<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:57.510> will

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
out of my voice as I speak this will

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
out of my voice as I speak this will
help<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> computer<00:00:58.320> better<00:00:58.620> recognize<00:00:59.190> what

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
help the computer better recognize what

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.610 
help the computer better recognize what
I<00:00:59.460> say<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.660> I'm<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> stop<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> video

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
I say and I'm going to stop the video

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.910 
I say and I'm going to stop the video
now<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.690> voice<00:01:03.870> tutorials<00:01:04.439> finished<00:01:04.769> so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
