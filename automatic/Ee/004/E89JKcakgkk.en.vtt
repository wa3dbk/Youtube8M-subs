00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hey, guys , I'm from the sound club. I'm 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.480
 here to make a video about the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.849
 samsung galaxy note of 2 m 7100 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.710
 as everyone already knows here has a n 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.240
 7 thousand is a comparison that I'm going to make 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.450
 it's a release from samsung and it goes 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:34.800
 be available in October this year 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 I'm here on the site www.tse.gov.br 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 zhar for you there at ok website then 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.999
 let's start here now with compare 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.059
 that 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:45.960
 basically the network 2g and 3g is the same 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.219
 thing 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.379
 what changes is the 4g that is a class and 11 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.390
 frequency while the other 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.329
 specific to some regions 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.979
 the launch as I said October 2012 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.170
 on 7000 7001 yes the galaxy note of 2 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.579
 and another was the launch in October 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 of last year he did of dimensions is 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:15.060
 too little from one to the other 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.960
 The weight increase of only two grams is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.640
 type of screen is is sensitive also has 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.789
 pen while the other is not dialing 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.170
 here but the pen is also the screen is a 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.259
 super capacitive touchscreen 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.039
 both have 16 million colors 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.439
 the screen of the owner of two is a little bit 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.649
 less is 80 pixels less than 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.679
 relation to the other and it is zero two 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:47.909
 inches more and the density is also is 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:51.210
 smaller is mutant gorilla glass while the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 gorilla glass to samsung galaxy note 12 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.780
 needles 2 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.399
 so much so that the interface 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 graphic of samsung 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.729
 certainly it is 4.0 that also does not 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.490
 specifying we have alerts of types of 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.869
 alert emigration mp3 and the error 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.720
 ringtones 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.710
 the best london peaks are the boxes 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.680
 sound the stop connector 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.510
 I doubt we have the card capacity here 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.050
 micro sd of up to 32 tips and memory 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.940
 may vary from 16 32 and 64 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.550
 to the enem of the year 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.230
 the difference is in ram and how much 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.660
 has 1 giga 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.090
 the galaxy note of 2 has 2gb of memory 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.610
 ram and vr ps is certainly the same class 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.700
 what changes a bit here is the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.310
 speed he has one he has 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.970
 a category 3 ac of 50 is mega per 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 mega mega bits nÃ© personal 50 mega bits and 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.280
 upload and 10 megapixel download knows 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.660
 that is you take the mega video bits 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.130
 for eight you have the amount of 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:12.630
 m &amp; c the wireless network is is the same 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.650
 standard abgn changes that of the ao band 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:21.090
 the two have dna wifi direct wifi hotspot 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.750
 bluetooth changes keverson 4 him as 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.970
 nfc is optional and if it comes with it 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.290
 is a short-circuit connecting device 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.890
 distance 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 He does not have a red door. He has a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:40.140
 micro usb connector 1 sp hot hot support 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.690
