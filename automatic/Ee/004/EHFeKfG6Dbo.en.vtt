00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.480 
into the camera all mani just smell
where<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:13.610> walked<00:01:13.850> in<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.710> he<00:01:15.890> was<00:01:16.130> he<00:01:16.460> was

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
where we walked in and he was he was

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.030 
where we walked in and he was he was
right<00:01:16.790> on<00:01:17.000> our<00:01:17.180> trail

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
right on our trail

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.530 
right on our trail
and<00:01:21.369> that's<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.550> buck<00:01:22.730> we<00:01:22.909> know<00:01:23.060> from<00:01:23.300> cameras

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
and that's a buck we know from cameras

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.220 
and that's a buck we know from cameras
three-year-old<00:01:27.520> six<00:01:28.520> point<00:01:28.760> that<00:01:28.940> need<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.050> go

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
three-year-old six point that need to go

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.620 
three-year-old six point that need to go
and<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:32.050> believe<00:01:33.050> he<00:01:33.260> went<00:01:34.270> he<00:01:35.270> didn't<00:01:35.540> look

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
and I believe he went he didn't look

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:45.149 
and I believe he went he didn't look
like<00:01:35.690> he<00:01:35.870> was<00:01:36.140> making<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.590> too<00:01:36.740> far<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.570> uh<00:01:43.300> hmm

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
like he was making it too far so uh hmm

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.740 
like he was making it too far so uh hmm
leaves<00:01:46.159> me<00:01:46.340> with<00:01:46.460> one<00:01:46.640> buck<00:01:46.909> tag<00:01:47.150> on<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.540> year

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
leaves me with one buck tag on the year

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.140 
leaves me with one buck tag on the year
so<00:01:50.290> my<00:01:51.290> selectivity<00:01:52.070> probably<00:01:52.580> just<00:01:52.820> went<00:01:52.940> up

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
so my selectivity probably just went up

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.410 
so my selectivity probably just went up
a<00:01:53.270> little<00:01:53.450> bit<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.500> was<00:01:55.070> um<00:01:58.270> I'll<00:01:59.270> be

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.580
