can<00:03:00.040> move<00:03:00.070> on<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.520> pumps<00:03:00.820> after<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.120> pumps

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
can move on to the pumps after the pumps

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.170 
can move on to the pumps after the pumps
here<00:03:01.570> what<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.110> want<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.380> do<00:03:02.500> is<00:03:02.850> both<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.060> them

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
here what you want to do is both of them

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.060 
here what you want to do is both of them
my<00:03:04.360> face<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.750> melt<00:03:04.900> words<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> had<00:03:05.770> just<00:03:06.010> a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
my face to melt words so I had just a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.010 
my face to melt words so I had just a
little<00:03:06.340> bit<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.610> leveraging<00:03:07.450> point<00:03:07.780> here<00:03:07.990> to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
little bit of leveraging point here to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.080 
little bit of leveraging point here to
work<00:03:08.320> with<00:03:08.590> which<00:03:08.860> would<00:03:09.070> be<00:03:09.190> where<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.580> other

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
work with which would be where the other

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.630 
work with which would be where the other
line<00:03:10.450> goes<00:03:10.720> on<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.230> we<00:03:12.040> want<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.520> just

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
line goes on to we want to do is just

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.130 
line goes on to we want to do is just
twist<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.000> back<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.420> forth<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.780> pull<00:03:13.960> it<00:03:14.050> up

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
twist it back and forth and pull it up

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.140 
twist it back and forth and pull it up
like<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:14.500> these<00:03:14.620> are<00:03:14.800> fairly<00:03:15.370> easy<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.970> come

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
like so these are fairly easy to come

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.790 
like so these are fairly easy to come
out<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.510> didn't<00:03:16.870> have<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.110> apply<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.410> whole<00:03:17.590> lot

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
out I didn't have to apply a whole lot

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.770 
out I didn't have to apply a whole lot
of<00:03:17.830> pressure<00:03:18.040> then<00:03:18.820> once<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.300> those<00:03:19.510> out

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
of pressure then once you get those out

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.300 
of pressure then once you get those out
you<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:20.020> then<00:03:20.050> work<00:03:20.320> your<00:03:20.530> way<00:03:20.680> on<00:03:20.710> to<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
you can then work your way on to the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.120 
you can then work your way on to the
rubber<00:03:21.970> grommets<00:03:22.720> as<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.440> rubber<00:03:23.590> grommets

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
rubber grommets as the rubber grommets

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.490 
rubber grommets as the rubber grommets
here<00:03:24.280> they'll<00:03:24.970> still<00:03:25.240> stay<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.840> tank<00:03:26.200> here

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
here they'll still stay in the tank here

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.229 
here they'll still stay in the tank here
now<00:03:26.740> they<00:03:26.860> are<00:03:26.950> fairly<00:03:27.250> easy<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.670> work<00:03:27.880> with<00:03:28.030> as

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
now they are fairly easy to work with as

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.240 
now they are fairly easy to work with as
well<00:03:28.570> we<00:03:29.110> want<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.650> just<00:03:29.770> simply<00:03:29.950> start

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
well we want to do is just simply start

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.890 
well we want to do is just simply start
from<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.550> front<00:03:30.670> side<00:03:30.910> just<00:03:31.150> pushed<00:03:31.450> inward

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
from the front side just pushed inward

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.930 
from the front side just pushed inward
like<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:33.130> relieves<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.520> pressure<00:03:33.670> on

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
like so just relieves the pressure on

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.490 
like so just relieves the pressure on
the<00:03:34.030> outside<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.600> then<00:03:35.020> you<00:03:35.050> can<00:03:35.200> just<00:03:35.320> pull

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
the outside and then you can just pull

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.590 
the outside and then you can just pull
straight<00:03:35.800> up<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.130> didn't<00:03:36.730> use<00:03:36.850> any<00:03:36.970> tools<00:03:37.239> for

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
straight up I didn't use any tools for

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.650 
straight up I didn't use any tools for
removing<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.410> pump<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.040> plugs<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:40.150> lines<00:03:40.420> or

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
removing the pump the plugs the lines or

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.699 
removing the pump the plugs the lines or
these<00:03:40.840> rubber<00:03:41.080> grommet<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:41.500> did<00:03:41.620> everything

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
these rubber grommet just did everything

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.560 
these rubber grommet just did everything
by<00:03:42.070> hand<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:42.670> was<00:03:42.760> fairly<00:03:43.030> easy<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.420> work

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
by hand and it was fairly easy to work

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.420 
by hand and it was fairly easy to work
with<00:03:43.630> now<00:03:44.410> next<00:03:44.620> what<00:03:44.800> we'll<00:03:44.920> do<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:45.340> we'll

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
with now next what we'll do is we'll

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.550 
with now next what we'll do is we'll
move<00:03:45.580> on<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.170> installation<00:03:47.170> with<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> new

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
move on to the installation with the new

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.010 
move on to the installation with the new
grommets<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.310> this<00:03:48.489> here<00:03:48.730> on<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.780> backside

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
grommets on this here on the backside

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.740 
grommets on this here on the backside
here<00:03:50.410> for<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.650> sensor<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.670> sensor<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:52.270> can't

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
here for the sensor the sensor I can't

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.420 
here for the sensor the sensor I can't
exactly<00:03:53.050> twist<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.440> sensor<00:03:53.800> because<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.280> does

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
exactly twist the sensor because it does

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.550 
exactly twist the sensor because it does
have<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.720> alignment<00:03:55.720> tab<00:03:55.870> on<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.110> side<00:03:56.290> here<00:03:56.530> so

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
have a alignment tab on the side here so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.380 
have a alignment tab on the side here so
it<00:03:56.860> ensures<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.310> sensor<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.790> placed<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.300> the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
it ensures the sensor is placed in the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.150 
it ensures the sensor is placed in the
correct<00:03:58.750> orientation<00:03:58.930> but<00:03:59.890> one<00:03:59.980> deal<00:04:00.130> with

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
correct orientation but one deal with

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.760 
correct orientation but one deal with
this<00:04:00.340> here<00:04:00.580> is<00:04:00.700> just<00:04:01.260> you're<00:04:02.260> able<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.500> twist

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
this here is just you're able to twist

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.380 
this here is just you're able to twist
just<00:04:02.980> ever<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.370> slightly<00:04:03.400> do<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> bit<00:04:04.360> of

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
just ever so slightly do have a bit of

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.990 
just ever so slightly do have a bit of
play<00:04:04.630> with<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.840> tab<00:04:05.170> there<00:04:05.440> but<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.890> just<00:04:06.310> may

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
play with that tab there but I just may

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.430 
play with that tab there but I just may
even<00:04:07.270> pressure<00:04:07.480> rocked<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:07.959> back<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.290> forth

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
even pressure rocked it back and forth

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.720 
even pressure rocked it back and forth
and<00:04:08.590> then<00:04:08.709> pulled<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.130> straight<00:04:09.220> out<00:04:09.370> now<00:04:09.700> just

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
and then pulled it straight out now just

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.130 
and then pulled it straight out now just
to<00:04:09.970> show<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.180> what<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.420> sensor<00:04:10.720> does<00:04:10.900> look

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
to show you what the sensor does look

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.560 
to show you what the sensor does look
like<00:04:11.290> here<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.770> we<00:04:12.040> do<00:04:12.220> have<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.570> float

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
like here you can see we do have a float

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.330 
like here you can see we do have a float
level<00:04:13.780> here<00:04:14.110> which<00:04:14.260> does<00:04:14.470> go<00:04:14.650> up<00:04:14.770> and<00:04:14.920> down<00:04:15.040> and

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
level here which does go up and down and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.560 
level here which does go up and down and
that<00:04:15.430> will<00:04:15.520> be<00:04:15.640> facing<00:04:15.850> towards<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.239> bottom

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
that will be facing towards the bottom

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.390 
that will be facing towards the bottom
side<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.810> when<00:04:17.020> we<00:04:17.080> do<00:04:17.200> pull<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.650> out<00:04:17.890> I<00:04:18.130> just

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
side and when we do pull that out I just

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.250 
side and when we do pull that out I just
want<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.640> watch<00:04:18.790> we<00:04:19.060> just<00:04:19.090> don't<00:04:19.480> break<00:04:20.080> this

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
want to watch we just don't break this

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.020 
want to watch we just don't break this
off<00:04:20.470> or<00:04:20.799> doesn't<00:04:21.070> happen<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.340> pop<00:04:21.489> off<00:04:21.760> where

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
off or doesn't happen to pop off where

because<00:04:53.030> again<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:53.479> can<00:04:53.690> have<00:04:54.470> some<00:04:54.830> havoc

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
because again that can have some havoc

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.610 
because again that can have some havoc
on<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.639> washer<00:04:56.629> Motors<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.139> dirt<00:04:57.319> can<00:04:57.470> get

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
on the washer Motors and dirt can get

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.990 
on the washer Motors and dirt can get
inside<00:04:57.889> and<00:04:58.190> then<00:04:58.280> destroy<00:04:58.669> them<00:04:58.789> and<00:04:58.909> then

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
inside and then destroy them and then

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.270 
inside and then destroy them and then
you'll<00:04:59.090> have<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.270> replace<00:04:59.479> them<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.650> when

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
you'll have to replace them and when

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.920 
you'll have to replace them and when
reinstalling<00:05:01.550> them<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.090> can<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:02.539> go<00:05:02.840> ahead

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
reinstalling them you can just go ahead

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.659 
reinstalling them you can just go ahead
and<00:05:03.349> reinstall<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.800> grommets<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.340> the

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
and reinstall the grommets and the

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.529 
and reinstall the grommets and the
motors<00:05:05.419> dry<00:05:06.009> but<00:05:07.009> I<00:05:07.340> may<00:05:07.970> be<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.120> little<00:05:08.330> bit<00:05:08.449> of

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
motors dry but I may be a little bit of

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.939 
motors dry but I may be a little bit of
issues<00:05:08.840> there<00:05:09.050> with<00:05:09.139> binding<00:05:09.560> up<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.830> might

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
issues there with binding up it might

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.800 
issues there with binding up it might
give<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.220> a<00:05:10.280> little<00:05:10.460> bit<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.580> hard<00:05:10.819> time<00:05:11.090> so

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
give you a little bit of hard time so

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.210 
give you a little bit of hard time so
therefore<00:05:12.139> you<00:05:12.229> can<00:05:12.259> go<00:05:12.530> ahead<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:12.889> maybe<00:05:12.979> use

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
therefore you can go ahead and maybe use

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.219 
therefore you can go ahead and maybe use
even<00:05:13.400> a<00:05:13.490> silicone<00:05:13.880> spray<00:05:14.180> or<00:05:14.539> just<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:15.020> little

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
even a silicone spray or just a little

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.570 
even a silicone spray or just a little
bit<00:05:15.319> of<00:05:15.440> soap<00:05:15.650> now<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.009> wouldn't<00:05:16.340> recommend

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
bit of soap now I wouldn't recommend

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.899 
bit of soap now I wouldn't recommend
normally<00:05:17.509> using<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.960> grease<00:05:18.440> or<00:05:18.909> petroleum

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
normally using a grease or petroleum

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.510 
normally using a grease or petroleum
jelly<00:05:20.240> or<00:05:20.389> Vaseline<00:05:21.250> because<00:05:22.250> what<00:05:22.430> can

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
jelly or Vaseline because what can

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.129 
jelly or Vaseline because what can
happen<00:05:22.580> here<00:05:22.909> is<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.150> petroleum<00:05:23.810> jelly<00:05:24.020> or

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
happen here is the petroleum jelly or

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.020 
happen here is the petroleum jelly or
Vaseline<00:05:24.590> can<00:05:24.979> go<00:05:25.250> ahead<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.580> dry<00:05:25.729> out<00:05:25.849> those

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
Vaseline can go ahead and dry out those

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.700 
Vaseline can go ahead and dry out those
rubbers<00:05:26.389> and<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.720> other<00:05:26.870> issue<00:05:27.139> also<00:05:27.470> have<00:05:27.620> to

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
rubbers and the other issue also have to

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.920 
rubbers and the other issue also have to
worry<00:05:27.860> about<00:05:27.949> between<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.419> those<00:05:29.419> materials

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
worry about between the those materials

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.800 
worry about between the those materials
is<00:05:30.050> that<00:05:30.099> they<00:05:31.099> are<00:05:31.250> thicker<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:31.810> fluid

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
is that they are thicker and fluid

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.180 
is that they are thicker and fluid
doesn't<00:05:32.930> tend<00:05:33.139> to<00:05:33.199> wash<00:05:33.409> those<00:05:33.650> away<00:05:33.889> so<00:05:33.949> they

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
doesn't tend to wash those away so they

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.399 
doesn't tend to wash those away so they
do<00:05:34.280> kind<00:05:34.550> of<00:05:34.610> get<00:05:34.729> stuck<00:05:35.030> in<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.690> strainer<00:05:36.169> or

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
do kind of get stuck in the strainer or

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.080 
do kind of get stuck in the strainer or
around<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.949> sensor<00:05:37.310> say<00:05:37.490> or<00:05:37.610> even<00:05:37.639> in<00:05:37.969> the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
around the sensor say or even in the

around the sensor say or even in the
motors<00:05:38.449> themselves<00:05:38.960> they<00:05:39.080> can<00:05:39.289> cause<00:05:40.250> some

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
motors themselves they can cause some

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.379 
motors themselves they can cause some
issues<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.789> can<00:05:40.909> see<00:05:41.030> already<00:05:41.120> got<00:05:41.330> the

the<00:05:51.949> liner<00:05:52.159> is<00:05:52.340> I<00:05:52.400> would<00:05:52.550> go<00:05:52.669> ahead<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:52.909> fill

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
the liner is I would go ahead and fill

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.309 
the liner is I would go ahead and fill
up<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.300> system<00:05:53.630> just<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.870> ensure<00:05:54.110> there<00:05:54.289> is

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
up the system just to ensure there is

any leaks if there is any leaks and yet

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.010 
any leaks if there is any leaks and yet
would<00:05:56.000> take<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.300> proper<00:05:56.539> procedures<00:05:56.990> in

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
would take the proper procedures in

would take the proper procedures in
order<00:05:57.169> to<00:05:57.380> correct<00:05:57.650> those<00:05:57.860> for<00:05:58.580> the<00:05:58.639> rubber

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
order to correct those for the rubber

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.070

grommet<00:05:59.150> to<00:05:59.240> replace<00:05:59.569> there<00:05:59.810> shouldn't<00:05:59.990> be

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
grommet to replace there shouldn't be

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.050

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.309 
any issues possibly these plastic lines
may<00:06:02.240> cause<00:06:02.479> an<00:06:02.630> issue<00:06:02.719> if<00:06:02.930> they've<00:06:03.050> stretched

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 
may cause an issue if they've stretched
