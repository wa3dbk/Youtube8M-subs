the stadium air blows over the ice bank

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.900 
the stadium air blows over the ice bank
and<00:00:38.560> cools<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:39.070> stadium<00:00:39.430> actually<00:00:39.790> from

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
and cools the stadium actually from

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.490 
and cools the stadium actually from
beneath<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.270> seat<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:40.989> you'll<00:00:41.110> be<00:00:41.200> sitting

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
beneath the seat so you'll be sitting

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.860 
beneath the seat so you'll be sitting
there<00:00:41.650> getting<00:00:42.100> cool<00:00:42.430> air<00:00:42.670> blasted<00:00:43.300> from

beneath you
that's<00:00:45.070> how<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.340> cold<00:00:45.700> air<00:00:45.910> gets<00:00:46.180> into<00:00:46.540> the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
that's how the cold air gets into the

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.670 
that's how the cold air gets into the
stadium<00:00:46.870> right<00:00:47.079> most<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.380> us<00:00:47.500> who<00:00:47.560> know

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
stadium right most of us who know

usually use it with our windows open
we're<00:00:52.480> talking<00:00:52.750> about<00:00:52.840> open<00:00:53.440> venues<00:00:54.309> I'm

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
we're talking about open venues I'm

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.100 
we're talking about open venues I'm
exactly<00:00:55.030> okay<00:00:55.540> they're<00:00:55.840> going<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.050> be

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
exactly okay they're going to be

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.889 
exactly okay they're going to be
literally<00:00:56.380> fighting<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.820> desert<00:00:58.360> heat<00:00:58.660> and

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
literally fighting the desert heat and

adamant that football is an outdoor

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.820 
adamant that football is an outdoor
sport<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.690> it<00:01:04.780> must<00:01:04.900> be<00:01:04.930> played<00:01:05.199> under<00:01:05.590> the

but that will people be sitting in the
Sun<00:01:38.170> I<00:01:38.200> mean<00:01:38.350> if<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:38.799> look<00:01:38.950> at<00:01:39.040> just<00:01:39.220> even<00:01:39.460> some

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
Sun I mean if you look at just even some

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:40.920 
Sun I mean if you look at just even some
of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.060> animations<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.630> we've<00:01:40.810> been

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
of the animations that we've been

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.539 
of the animations that we've been
showing<00:01:41.080> some<00:01:41.530> people<00:01:41.799> are<00:01:41.890> higher<00:01:42.159> up<00:01:42.189> than

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
showing some people are higher up than

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.399

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
to end up cooked I don't think so I

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.730 
to end up cooked I don't think so I
think<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.430> way<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:52.060> fixed<00:01:52.960> this<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.710> a

firm<00:02:09.220> also<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:10.090> designing<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:11.380> prevents

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
firm also is designing this it prevents

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.440 
firm also is designing this it prevents
solar<00:02:12.130> heat<00:02:12.430> gain<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.120> when<00:02:13.330> you're

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
solar heat gain so that when you're

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.190 
solar heat gain so that when you're
sitting<00:02:13.599> under

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
sitting under

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400 
sitting under
these<00:02:14.440> ETF<00:02:15.250> II<00:02:15.520> panels<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.330> lot<00:02:16.870> less<00:02:17.050> heat<00:02:17.260> from

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
these ETF II panels a lot less heat from

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.170 
these ETF II panels a lot less heat from
the<00:02:17.530> Sun<00:02:17.680> actually<00:02:17.860> makes<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.819> inside

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
the Sun actually makes it to the inside

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.520 
the Sun actually makes it to the inside
so<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.480> don't<00:02:19.690> think<00:02:19.810> we'll<00:02:19.989> be<00:02:20.019> cooking<00:02:20.410> any

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
so I don't think we'll be cooking any

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.160 
so I don't think we'll be cooking any
any<00:02:20.860> sports<00:02:21.129> fans<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:21.849> we<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.209> heard<00:02:22.390> a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
any sports fans now we just heard a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.500 
any sports fans now we just heard a
moment<00:02:23.620> ago<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:24.489> this<00:02:24.879> technology<00:02:25.209> is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
moment ago that this technology is

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.490 
moment ago that this technology is
familiar<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.980> has<00:02:27.129> been<00:02:27.400> tried<00:02:28.349> does<00:02:29.349> it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
familiar that it has been tried does it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.990 
familiar that it has been tried does it
tend<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.010> work<00:02:30.220> really<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:30.910> work

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
tend to work really is it going to work

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.059 
tend to work really is it going to work
income<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> this<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.739> huge

demonstration<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:34.120> an<00:02:34.239> existing<00:02:34.690> technology

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
demonstration of an existing technology

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.410 
demonstration of an existing technology
part<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.040> what<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.340> firm<00:02:36.550> wanted<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.000> do<00:02:37.120> was

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
part of what the firm wanted to do was

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.360 
part of what the firm wanted to do was
use<00:02:37.810> conventional<00:02:38.140> components<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.099> a<00:02:39.130> really

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
use conventional components on a really

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.460 
use conventional components on a really
massive<00:02:39.640> scale<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.840> they're<00:02:40.989> scaling<00:02:41.380> it

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
massive scale and so they're scaling it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.559 
massive scale and so they're scaling it
up<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.400> proven<00:02:42.580> technology<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.480> I'm

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
up and it's a proven technology and I'm

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.129 
up and it's a proven technology and I'm
really<00:02:44.230> excited<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.739> see<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.950> work
