00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.830
 Well I come to tell you a little bit how 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.539
 it was my experience in the mir then not 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.880
 I knew very well what time to take if 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.609
 when you start the first round of the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.470
 second round or when it was already fair 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.810
 day before what I will tell you a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.250
 little is when the mir mail me I knew 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 that it was real that he had to do the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.439
 exam and that was just the week that 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.570
 you have on vacation before 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.430
 you start the library is to study 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.320
 in summer when you have already passed the party 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.450
 of graduation you have already done all the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.130
 plans of the world with your friends for 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.010
 be able to go every day at 8 o'clock 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.260
 tomorrow all together to the library for 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.630
 take the best site of all fair 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.940
 before that you have a week of 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.280
 vacations where I with my friends 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.110
 we went to the beach then we were 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.490
 on the beach my friends stayed a 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.620
 couple of days more and I had to go back 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.899
 here to madrid 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.360
 then while I was on the train and I 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.879
 I came back here because I realized 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.250
 everything that was going to happen to me that no longer 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.659
 I was going to see the beach again that I was going to 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.030
 have to work hard and 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.619
 study a lot more hours than what 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.600
 better the rest of the world to get 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.990
 what I wanted it was to have the option 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.360
 to choose a square a square that 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.210
 will accommodate what I will like me 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.790
 liked then that was the time in 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.700
 that for me the mir started then 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.940
 come the moments of study of 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.920
 sit for hours without stopping to have your 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.820
 rest moments but know how to use 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.160
 those moments of rest and all that is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.259
 get drunk in your head you attribute not 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.200
 you know very well how to do then to 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 that's the method of cc.oo 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.869
 the method that you have to 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.610
 Trust blindly to know that they are going 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.189
 to guide that they will help you in everything 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 what you want to know what method 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.869
 more suited to you come now in 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.819
 fifth when you start fifth comes to you 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.490
 your delegate one day and they will be coming 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.979
 an academy on Tuesday another on Wednesday 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 another Thursday you get you thinking and you 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.280
 I hope good to me what else gives me that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.299
 academy I have to choose now because 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.730
 even two years from now it's not going to 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.620
 study the thousand but good is something that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 is very important now maybe not you 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.500
 you realize but it's a decision that goes 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.390
 to condition everything you the rest of your 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.890
 professional career so to speak 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.480
 then therefore it is a decision 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.849
 what do you have to do in a way 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.799
 individual thinking of yourself in your 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.930
 own interests a little bit of a decision 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.209
 selfish you can not catch the academy 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.549
 according to your best friend will go or the girl 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.280
 that you liked and you do not have to take the 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.950
 decision according to what you want 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.390
 so to make that decision I 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.950
 first thing I did was see the manuals 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.080
 then also apart from the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.250
 of the manuals that is what you're going to 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.620
 base your study is also very 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.480
 important both the schedule and the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.060
 simulations you are going to do 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.890
 the schedule of cto is a web schedule very 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.989
 well I liked it a lot because it's 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.459
 moldable that is you have is true 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.780
 You have a planning where you have a 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.630
 week to study a subject 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.010
 but they do not tell you they do not force you to 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.500
 study certain topics of that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.630
 subject every day to me having to 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.040
 study me three subjects in a day and if not 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.430
 it arrived like that you studied those three 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.500
 topics according to the schedule because to me that 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.630
 It overwhelmed me very much to think that I had to 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.370
 meet a 100% schedule and can not 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.930
 do it because right to the best you 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.540
 You study a short song a little more 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.930
 then that overwhelms me a lot and 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.090
 I left you before I started that 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.519
 subject adapt to the planning to 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.650
 your needs and your capacity because 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.260
 we each study at a speed and of 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.390
 a certain way then that you 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.340
 it helps to mold you a bit and then 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.489
 the simulations that you do a total good 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.230
 I did a total of 26 drills 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.389
 easy difficult sorted messy 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.020
 with all the things that can fall into 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.820
 mine 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.460
 it is suspected that they will fall in the near 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.860
 you've seen them before in a whole simulation 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.570
 that is, there is no doubt that anything 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.060
 strange that they happen to put the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.440
 people who put a thousand obstacles to right 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.750
 before in a simulation and that gives you a 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.060
 tranquility a security that at 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.450
 better you do not have doing it in others 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.010
 sites I'm very happy you can not 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.930
 write nothing bad or I can 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.120
 regret the of the option that I have 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.580
 taken from the decision you make and when 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.370
 in fifth I signed up for the academy because 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.550
 it's something that helps me a lot 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.890
 they have made me that having a file 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.170
 and a career where I had a 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.360
 pretty normal record as I've seen 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.890
 that studying and striving that yes that 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.840
 you are the one who studies all those 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.820
 that you work hard but they are the ones who 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.430
 they guide you they are the ones that tell you how 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.140
 you have to do things as you 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.940
 adapt you have to adapt the calendar 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.590
 to you mother how do you have to adapt the 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.320
 schedule how do you have to adapt the 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.780
 subjects all that they are the ones 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.060
 they are guiding you in this on the way 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.310
 turbulent that is until you get to the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.810
 day of the exam and they helped me 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.150
 much 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.270
 and thanks to that I have been able to do what 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.340
 I have loved and where I have loved 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.520
 I think that the best thing to define so much 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.130
 the study in the mir study is the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.870
 intense word the study is intense the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.520
 I overwhelm the tears 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.540
 the despair all that comes at the end 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.490
 when you have finished your exam 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.440
 when you are going to approach the day of the exam 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.780
 it comes to you there on your calendar that you have 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.690
 put on the wall like this a very big day 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.450
 in red that put them flame and faces 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.510
 sad around all those things just 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.170
 it's there when you're close and you see it already in 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.940
 the month of January is when you get overwhelmed 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.120
 and you cry but before it's all intensity 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.030
 is a matter of continuing to maintain 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.730
 rhythm all the time not hitting sprint is not 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.640
 suddenly sitting without doing 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.250
 nothing is not a matter of staying 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.569
 constant that constancy is what is going 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.900
 to help 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:58.169
 to be able to do a good exam 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.600
 it's not that it's hard or sorry it's not that 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.490
 be difficult and if you have bad record 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.080
 you will not be able to do what you want 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.880
 what you have to do 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.310
 we can all get to get a 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.780
 women do a good exam and be able 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.930
 get the place you want but for 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.430
 you need to never give up and 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.080
 keep fighting and although things will 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.270
 the simulacra go badly because they will go 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.520
 bad we have all gone wrong not always 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.289
 everything is a path of roses but despite 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.030
 that everything is going badly for you to follow 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.310
 struggling and keep trying every day 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.400
 and that's what is going to help you 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.500
 get it what 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.160
 if there was much encouragement lucky that 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.160
 you all go well
