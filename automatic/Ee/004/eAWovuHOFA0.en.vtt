00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that soon hopefully I've already done it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
that soon hopefully I've already done it
but<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.490> haven't<00:01:38.729> compiled<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> rest<00:01:39.570> yet<00:01:39.869> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
but I haven't compiled the rest yet so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
but I haven't compiled the rest yet so
then<00:01:40.229> keep<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.680> forward<00:01:40.950> still<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.880> like

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
then keep going forward still just like

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.310 
then keep going forward still just like
I<00:01:42.180> would<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.420> been<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.630> daddy<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.020> almost

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I would have been your daddy it's almost

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.469 
I would have been your daddy it's almost
all<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:43.890> through<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> same<00:01:44.759> you're

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
all the way through the same you're

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.090 
all the way through the same you're
gonna<00:01:45.600> stay<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.439> slant<00:01:46.829> here

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
gonna stay on this little slant here

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
gonna stay on this little slant here
until<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> checkpoint<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
until you get the checkpoint on the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.920 
until you get the checkpoint on the
corner<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.780> you're

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
corner right about now and then you're

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
corner right about now and then you're
gonna<00:01:52.020> keep<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.649> straight<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.430> normally

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
gonna keep going straight now normally

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
gonna keep going straight now normally
you're<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.299> turn<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.689> after<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.649> jump

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you're gonna turn right after this jump

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.370 
you're gonna turn right after this jump
to<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> next<00:01:57.479> checkpoint<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.200> for

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
to go for the next checkpoint and for

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.709 
to go for the next checkpoint and for
the<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> would<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.770> been<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.070> daddy<00:01:59.280> skull

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
the I would have been your daddy skull

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.520 
the I would have been your daddy skull
sometimes<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> checkpoint<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.380> pop

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
sometimes the checkpoint will pop

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.050 
sometimes the checkpoint will pop
sometimes<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.130> won't<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.790> don't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
sometimes it won't for this you don't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.609 
sometimes it won't for this you don't
need<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:03.960> why<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.409> move

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
need it to so that's why I just move

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.950 
need it to so that's why I just move
forward<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.270> need<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.750> do

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
forward here now what you do need to do

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
forward here now what you do need to do
I<00:02:07.259> haven't<00:02:07.829> had<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> work<00:02:08.340> without<00:02:08.520> doing<00:02:09.030> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
I haven't had it work without doing this

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
I haven't had it work without doing this
and<00:02:09.420> maybe<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.750> will<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> haven't<00:02:10.560> seen<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
and maybe it will but I haven't seen it

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.740 
and maybe it will but I haven't seen it
happen<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.430> works<00:02:11.700> 100%<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> time

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
happen this works 100% of the time

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
happen this works 100% of the time
almost

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
almost

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
almost
when<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.630> need<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.810> kill

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
when you do this is you need to kill

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.260 
when you do this is you need to kill
this<00:02:16.380> elite<00:02:16.830> down<00:02:17.100> here<00:02:17.430> he<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.970> take<00:02:18.240> a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
this elite down here he can take a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.080 
this elite down here he can take a
beating<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.750> legendary<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.640> bad

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.820 

if<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:24.780> shoot<00:02:24.960> him<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.410> have

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
if you can actually shoot him and I have

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.770 
if you can actually shoot him and I have
not<00:02:26.100> gotten<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.640> halo<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.090> grenade<00:02:27.450> throws

down yet I keep missing everything I'm a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.910 
down yet I keep missing everything I'm a
little<00:02:30.330> bit<00:02:30.480> rusty<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.140> we're<00:02:31.590> gonna<00:02:31.680> go

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
little bit rusty but we're gonna go

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.290 
little bit rusty but we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.370> kill<00:02:32.640> him<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.090> once<00:02:33.210> you

ahead and just kill him and once you
kill<00:02:33.510> him<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.870> may<00:02:34.080> get<00:02:34.560> another<00:02:34.650> checkpoint

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
kill him you may get another checkpoint

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.850 
kill him you may get another checkpoint
as<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.820> round<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.510> corner<00:02:36.750> here<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.590> may

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
as you round this corner here you may

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.100 
as you round this corner here you may
not<00:02:38.100> that's<00:02:38.370> okay<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.360> might<00:02:39.570> want<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.900> have

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
not that's okay you might want to have

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.590 
not that's okay you might want to have
the<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.550> it's<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.850> envy<00:02:42.000> skull<00:02:42.450> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
the I think it's the envy skull that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.030 
the I think it's the envy skull that
lets<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.020> use<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.230> invisibility<00:02:43.710> at<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
lets you use the invisibility at a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.200 
lets you use the invisibility at a
flashlight<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.580> might<00:02:44.760> want<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:44.970> turn<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
flashlight you might want to turn that

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.850 
flashlight you might want to turn that
on<00:02:45.450> because<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.470> saw<00:02:46.650> there

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
on because there are as you saw there

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.590 
on because there are as you saw there

it'll come in handy

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.010 
it'll come in handy
when<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.790> come<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.090> kill<00:02:51.390> these<00:02:51.570> elites<00:02:51.900> so
