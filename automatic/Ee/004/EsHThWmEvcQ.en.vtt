so we've got a lot of cool new things

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.220 
so we've got a lot of cool new things
coming<00:00:02.429> into<00:00:02.760> taking<00:00:03.060> king<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:04.020> definitely

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
coming into taking king we definitely

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.920 
coming into taking king we definitely
listen<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.890> fan<00:00:05.460> feedback<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.390> one<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
listen to fan feedback and one of the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.720 
listen to fan feedback and one of the
things<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.230> people<00:00:07.529> are<00:00:07.710> asking<00:00:08.280> about<00:00:08.400> is

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
things that people are asking about is

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.910 
things that people are asking about is
is<00:00:09.030> an<00:00:09.300> objective<00:00:09.480> style<00:00:10.080> mode<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.710> that's

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
is an objective style mode and so that's

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.879 
is an objective style mode and so that's
that's<00:00:11.250> where<00:00:11.490> rift<00:00:11.730> really<00:00:12.120> came<00:00:12.330> from<00:00:12.889> we

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
that's where rift really came from we

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.379 
that's where rift really came from we
weren't<00:00:14.070> happy<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.670> something<00:00:15.179> like<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
weren't happy to do something like a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.140 
weren't happy to do something like a
traditional<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.470> run-of-the-mill<00:00:17.310> CTF<00:00:17.970> we

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
traditional like run-of-the-mill CTF we

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.240 
traditional like run-of-the-mill CTF we
wanted<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.690> something<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.199> felt<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:20.010> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
wanted to do something that felt more in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.250 
wanted to do something that felt more in
line<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.300> Destiny<00:00:21.480> world<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.050> like

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
line with what the Destiny world is like

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.370 
line with what the Destiny world is like
so<00:00:22.560> rift<00:00:23.220> became<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.000> thing<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.109> sits

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so rift became this thing where it sits

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
so rift became this thing where it sits
closer<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> neutral<00:00:26.640> bomb<00:00:26.820> assault

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
closer to like a neutral bomb assault

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.359 
closer to like a neutral bomb assault
where<00:00:27.689> there's<00:00:28.320> an<00:00:28.529> objective<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> center

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
where there's an objective in the center

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.310 
where there's an objective in the center
of<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> map<00:00:29.760> only<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.570> team<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> at

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
of the map only one team can have it at

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.840 
of the map only one team can have it at
a<00:00:31.380> time<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> infiltrate

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
a time and then you want to infiltrate

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.569 
a time and then you want to infiltrate
the<00:00:33.180> other<00:00:33.329> teams<00:00:33.660> half<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> map<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.100> blow

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the other teams half of the map and blow

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.360 
the other teams half of the map and blow
it<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.880> earn<00:00:36.300> points<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.530> came<00:00:38.219> together

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it up earn points it came together

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.490 
it up earn points it came together
really<00:00:38.610> well<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.420> happy<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
really well and really happy with it and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.369 
really well and really happy with it and
it<00:00:40.620> sort<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> fits<00:00:41.100> into<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.719> 66<00:00:42.719> big<00:00:43.140> team

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it sort of fits into this 66 big team

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
it sort of fits into this 66 big team
objective<00:00:44.010> style<00:00:44.340> thing<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.820> never<00:00:45.000> had

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
objective style thing if we never had

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630 
objective style thing if we never had
before<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:46.469> take<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> traditional<00:00:47.309> mode<00:00:47.460> like

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
before you take a traditional mode like

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.959 
before you take a traditional mode like
CTF<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.230> binary<00:00:49.530> either<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.430> grab

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
CTF and it's very binary either you grab

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.459 
CTF and it's very binary either you grab
the<00:00:51.090> flag<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> enemy

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the flag and you take it to the enemy

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.930 
the flag and you take it to the enemy
teams<00:00:52.649> base<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> point<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
teams base and you get a point and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
teams base and you get a point and
that's<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> game<00:00:54.690> works<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.440> even

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that's the way the game works and even

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.170 
that's the way the game works and even
if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> make<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.160> ninety<00:00:56.610> five<00:00:56.730> percent<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
if you make it ninety five percent of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.490 
if you make it ninety five percent of
the<00:00:57.270> way<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.050> killed<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the way there and then get killed at the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
the way there and then get killed at the
last<00:00:58.800> second<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.850> nothing<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.989> it's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
last second you get nothing and so it's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
last second you get nothing and so it's
really<00:01:01.170> punitive<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> lot<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> people<00:01:02.250> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
really punitive for a lot of people so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
really punitive for a lot of people so
we<00:01:02.879> wanted<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> try<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.660> solve<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.290> those

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we wanted to try and solve some of those

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.100 
we wanted to try and solve some of those
issues<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.129> say<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.299> actually<00:01:06.810> paid

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
issues and say what if we actually paid

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.920 
issues and say what if we actually paid
out<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:08.010> partial<00:01:08.400> progress<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.210> even<00:01:09.840> if

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
out you know partial progress so even if

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.090 
out you know partial progress so even if
you<00:01:09.990> didn't<00:01:10.229> make<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> way<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> still

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you didn't make it all the way you still

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.350 
you didn't make it all the way you still
feel<00:01:11.340> pretty<00:01:11.610> good<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.060> made<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
feel pretty good because you made it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.910 
feel pretty good because you made it
most<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> way<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.680> things

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
most of the way and then we do things

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.120 
most of the way and then we do things
like<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> shot<00:01:15.509> clock<00:01:15.810> where<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
like you know the shot clock where the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
like you know the shot clock where the
spark<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.909> pick<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
spark that you pick up and you have to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.499 
spark that you pick up and you have to
take<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> rift<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> timer<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
take to the rift we put a timer on you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
take to the rift we put a timer on you
so<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.720> can't<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.320> can't<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.680> run<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
so you can't just you can't just run to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
so you can't just you can't just run to
your<00:01:23.220> side<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> map<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
your side of the map and be like you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.270 
your side of the map and be like you
know<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.170> hide<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> corner<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.100> make

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
know like hide in the corner and make

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300 
know like hide in the corner and make
the<00:01:26.430> other<00:01:26.549> team<00:01:27.200> frustrated<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.070> don't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the other team frustrated if you don't

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.310 
the other team frustrated if you don't
execute<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.079> we

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
where we instituted what we call

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.570 
where we instituted what we call
rotators<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:50.770> know<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.070> sort<00:02:51.430> of

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
rotators and you know that sort of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.460 
rotators and you know that sort of
worked<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.180> some<00:02:52.660> ways<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.020> works<00:02:53.200> really<00:02:53.380> well

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
worked in some ways it works really well

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.860 
worked in some ways it works really well
on<00:02:53.620> other<00:02:53.920> ways<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.190> doesn't<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.330> upside

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
on other ways it doesn't but the upside

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.560 
on other ways it doesn't but the upside
of<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.860> rotator<00:02:57.459> idea<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.120> allows

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
of like that rotator idea is that allows

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.540 
of like that rotator idea is that allows
us<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.930> do<00:02:59.080> things<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.500> mayhem<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.250> just

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
us to do things like mayhem and just

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.979

us pretty quickly with trials when we

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.270 
us pretty quickly with trials when we
gave<00:03:10.090> them<00:03:10.239> elimination<00:03:10.870> as<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.019> rotator<00:03:11.500> you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
gave them elimination as a rotator you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.280 
gave them elimination as a rotator you
know<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.580> first<00:03:12.850> post<00:03:13.570> that<00:03:13.840> we're<00:03:13.959> popping

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
know the first post that we're popping

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.690 
know the first post that we're popping
up<00:03:14.410> are<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.680> oh<00:03:14.860> my<00:03:15.010> god<00:03:15.190> just<00:03:15.400> make<00:03:15.670> it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700

do<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.670> we<00:03:18.820> want<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.120> play<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.390> all<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.540> time

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
do it we want to play it all the time

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.720 
do it we want to play it all the time
and<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.830> I've<00:03:20.920> seen<00:03:21.160> people<00:03:21.400> on

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
and so I think I've seen people on

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.039 
and so I think I've seen people on
message<00:03:22.060> boards<00:03:22.090> say<00:03:22.510> why<00:03:22.690> don't<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.930> just

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
message boards say why don't you just

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.900 
message boards say why don't you just
have<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.470> be<00:03:23.500> elimination<00:03:24.130> when<00:03:24.250> trials<00:03:24.489> isn't

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
have it be elimination when trials isn't

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.330 
have it be elimination when trials isn't
up<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.390> that's<00:03:25.510> what<00:03:25.630> we're<00:03:25.750> going<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.930> try

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
up and so that's what we're going to try

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.620 
up and so that's what we're going to try
there's<00:03:27.340> no<00:03:27.489> strategy<00:03:27.700> for<00:03:28.060> vehicles<00:03:28.420> right

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
there's no strategy for vehicles right

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.020 
there's no strategy for vehicles right
now<00:03:28.780> in<00:03:29.049> terms<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.769> combined<00:03:30.310> arms<00:03:30.700> which<00:03:30.880> is

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
now in terms of combined arms which is

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.729 
now in terms of combined arms which is
our<00:03:31.150> vehicle<00:03:31.540> specific<00:03:31.750> playlist<00:03:32.470> there's

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
our vehicle specific playlist there's

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.640 
our vehicle specific playlist there's
not<00:03:33.220> going<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.580> be<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:34.000> refresh<00:03:34.570> for<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:34.930> yet

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
not going to be a refresh for that yet

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.440 
not going to be a refresh for that yet
but<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.280> entirely<00:03:36.610> possible<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.330> do

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
but it's entirely possible that we do

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.360 
but it's entirely possible that we do
something<00:03:37.690> later<00:03:38.140> on<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.680> talk<00:03:38.890> about<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.250> all

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
something later on we talk about it all

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.550 
something later on we talk about it all
the<00:03:39.400> time<00:03:39.549> we<00:03:40.030> just<00:03:40.209> don't<00:03:40.390> have<00:03:40.570> anything<00:03:41.200> yet

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
the time we just don't have anything yet

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.580 
the time we just don't have anything yet
to<00:03:41.709> share

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
to share

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.110 
to share
and<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.099> crucible<00:03:43.489> we<00:03:43.580> have<00:03:43.730> this<00:03:43.849> really

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
and the crucible we have this really

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.570 
and the crucible we have this really
cool<00:03:44.360> opportunity<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:45.290> introduce<00:03:45.950> players<00:03:46.430> to

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
cool opportunity to introduce players to

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.850 
cool opportunity to introduce players to
things<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.300> they've<00:03:47.540> never<00:03:48.379> seen<00:03:48.680> before

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
things that they've never seen before

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.190 
things that they've never seen before
and<00:03:49.310> may<00:03:49.670> never<00:03:49.879> see<00:03:50.150> again<00:03:50.300> who<00:03:50.870> knows<00:03:51.080> if

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
and may never see again who knows if

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.740 
and may never see again who knows if
we'll<00:03:51.290> ever<00:03:51.410> go<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.709> mercury<00:03:52.220> beyond<00:03:52.750> burning

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
we'll ever go to mercury beyond burning

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.080 
we'll ever go to mercury beyond burning
shrine<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.650> new<00:03:54.830> map<00:03:55.099> vertigo<00:03:55.670> that's<00:03:55.940> in

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
shrine and the new map vertigo that's in

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.089 
shrine and the new map vertigo that's in
the<00:03:56.209> taken<00:03:56.540> king<00:03:56.720> we<00:03:57.170> may<00:03:57.349> never<00:03:57.500> go<00:03:57.769> there<00:03:57.950> as

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
the taken king we may never go there as

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.479 
the taken king we may never go there as
a<00:03:58.129> destination<00:03:58.430> as<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.690> PVE<00:04:00.230> activity<00:04:01.160> but

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
a destination as a PVE activity but

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.220 
a destination as a PVE activity but
sometimes<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.120> allows<00:04:02.330> us<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.780> sort<00:04:03.110> of

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
sometimes it allows us to sort of

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.869 
sometimes it allows us to sort of
forecast<00:04:03.769> something<00:04:04.250> that's<00:04:04.400> coming<00:04:04.670> in<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
forecast something that's coming in the

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.030 
forecast something that's coming in the
future<00:04:05.030> too<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:06.080> just<00:04:06.260> depends<00:04:06.739> right

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
future too and that just depends right

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.339 
future too and that just depends right
like<00:04:07.340> because<00:04:07.580> sometimes<00:04:08.349> development

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
like because sometimes development

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.619 
like because sometimes development
changes<00:04:10.310> right<00:04:10.580> like<00:04:10.849> something<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.299> we

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
changes right like something that we

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.119 
changes right like something that we
would<00:04:11.870> have<00:04:12.049> released<00:04:12.410> around<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.860> same<00:04:12.920> time

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
would have released around the same time

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.580 
would have released around the same time
maybe<00:04:13.640> doesn't<00:04:14.030> come<00:04:14.150> together<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:15.410> it's

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
maybe doesn't come together and so it's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.379 
maybe doesn't come together and so it's
pushed<00:04:15.799> off<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.220> later<00:04:16.459> release<00:04:16.639> or<00:04:17.060> then<00:04:17.209> it

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
pushed off to a later release or then it

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.120 
pushed off to a later release or then it
you<00:04:17.630> know<00:04:17.720> gets<00:04:17.959> back<00:04:18.229> Bernhard<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.889> never

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
you know gets back Bernhard and never

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.219 
you know gets back Bernhard and never
comes<00:04:19.400> back<00:04:19.519> again<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.810> know<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:20.930> want
