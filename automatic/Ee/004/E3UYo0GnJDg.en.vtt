00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.559
 or 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.559
 and I also 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 at that time the other bonus that 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.530
 I bring because it would not be videos by 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.720
 I study at school and I play that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.630
 but here the selector 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.289
 it's not that difficult in the good system 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.720
 more or less 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.270
 let's try to see how it because there 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.350
 we go on the other hand so you can see how 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 the fence is lowered the first one peeked out 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.030
 another and the tone went down let's see this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.899
 system is now here I am here 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.890
 I go around and for this he pushed the 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.890
 view the bid below 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.130
 and if push in again showed a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.610
 example in a cave 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.850
 to be like in this place are the two 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 the cables that if we step on them that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.610
 activate and well let's see each other 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.549
 here I was locked 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.080
 well I 'll show it in the system 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.140
 rest is the same 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.850
 goes out there 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.560
 I was going to spend 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.400
 well the battery we need are 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.119
 sand piston are not sticky normal 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.459
 planet rest go informing anybody 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.170
 could stone repeat arrest and piero 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.420
 nomination after not having more 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.170
 ingredient we wanted is the first 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.770
 step the first step to dealing with is the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.080
 basic part of this would be like this 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.400
 as if it were a wall we are going to do 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.400
 as if it were a wall 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.410
 to her 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.470
 that did not happen here is needed and I have 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.400
 done with the performance as well the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.550
 cables and hooks and then with the wires 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.040
 to connect and then the rest can 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.470
 so it works 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.440
 and well we will activate the by we have 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.820
 the third step would be a little more 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.780
 complicated we need to win and it would be 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.860
 two times three 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.600
 this part would be two because it would be the 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.990
 next easy it's called with leagues 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.990
 we will need sand pistons bricks 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.260
 here it is pushed for eye 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.290
 the dry sand on the own and there was 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.250
 and so they are pushing the fences 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.250
 so it would be 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.510
 and it breaks showing from below 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.090
 and good now for that and I would push the 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.090
 valleys below 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:49.590
 here in pushing and under the seats 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.950
 fifth step good here is called the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.910
 more or less rest system we're still there 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.060
 one two three four five six stones 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:05.580
 we would need one from the 3 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.520
 x 1 2 3 4 5 of 3.5 next to the last 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.110
 stone at least 3 away the rest the 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.810
 Stone incarnation on Monday and we 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:20.380
 a path of 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 and 4 ibaka 5 and 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:24.070
 then topics down there just 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.790
 sixth step also here we put the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.270
 system would be all this would already be 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.270
 full 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.410
 these repeaters this one has to be 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.490
 to the seconds the car last reality 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.660
 this would be the first thing to look 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.660
 without any effect 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.460
 ai ai ai ai ai we put a repeater with 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.620
 the final lever we put here and 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.680
 what they have is normal this I put dig 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.569
 here by a normal repeater if by here 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.710
 and other normal repeaters 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.710
 now good thing 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.660
 it was left and it went down it worked but friends 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.120
 Y 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.090
 good especially for today's subscribe 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.710
 to give to the there are favorites 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.990
 mc 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.630
 in a field and well you can say it 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.640
 also good as they subscribe they give 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.970
 like favorites and has served very well the 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.970
 true
