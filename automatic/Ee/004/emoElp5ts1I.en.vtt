00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.180 
just came back from flight fest we're
putting<00:00:13.300> our<00:00:13.389> stuff<00:00:13.480> away<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:14.080> it<00:00:14.800> dawned<00:00:15.009> on

putting our stuff away and it dawned on

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.100 
putting our stuff away and it dawned on
me<00:00:15.250> that<00:00:15.429> we<00:00:15.759> might<00:00:16.029> have<00:00:16.330> never<00:00:16.570> shown<00:00:16.869> you

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
me that we might have never shown you

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.410

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
just how well the right wing drag breaks

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.800 
just how well the right wing drag breaks
down<00:00:19.660> so<00:00:20.349> before<00:00:21.099> I<00:00:21.369> put<00:00:21.610> it<00:00:21.700> away<00:00:21.820> let<00:00:22.570> me<00:00:22.630> show

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
down so before I put it away let me show

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.990 
down so before I put it away let me show
you<00:00:22.869> now<00:00:23.439> we've<00:00:23.590> got<00:00:23.770> some<00:00:24.070> some<00:00:24.640> hours

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
you now we've got some some hours

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.359 
you now we've got some some hours
building<00:00:25.329> up<00:00:25.480> on<00:00:25.630> this<00:00:25.779> airframe<00:00:26.050> and<00:00:26.500> this<00:00:27.070> is

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
building up on this airframe and this is

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.819 
building up on this airframe and this is
the<00:00:27.730> prototype<00:00:28.329> so<00:00:29.320> there's<00:00:29.500> going<00:00:29.649> to<00:00:29.710> be<00:00:29.739> a

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
the prototype so there's going to be a

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.560 
the prototype so there's going to be a
few<00:00:30.309> little<00:00:30.430> tweaks<00:00:30.700> with<00:00:31.059> the<00:00:31.119> production

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
few little tweaks with the production

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.680 
few little tweaks with the production
version<00:00:31.750> but<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.940> whole<00:00:34.090> concepts

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
version but the the whole concepts

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.900 
version but the the whole concepts
pretty<00:00:34.989> much<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.290> say<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:36.610> we're<00:00:36.730> going<00:00:36.820> to

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
pretty much to say what we're going to

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.350 
pretty much to say what we're going to
do<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.180> put<00:00:37.300> it<00:00:37.420> together<00:00:38.160> easily<00:00:39.300> fly<00:00:40.300> the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
do to put it together easily fly the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.200 
do to put it together easily fly the
main<00:00:40.750> spar<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:41.410> there<00:00:41.640> there's<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.700> smaller<00:00:43.030> one

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
main spar in there there's a smaller one

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.300 
main spar in there there's a smaller one
that<00:00:43.330> goes<00:00:43.450> in<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.520> back<00:00:46.590> okay<00:00:47.590> now

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
that goes in the in the back okay now

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.950 
that goes in the in the back okay now
this<00:00:48.400> is<00:00:48.460> what<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.670> like<00:00:48.880> to<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.300> lot<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.840> the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
this is what I like to a lot of the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.900 
this is what I like to a lot of the
wings<00:00:50.200> you<00:00:51.100> don't<00:00:51.250> have<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.490> option<00:00:51.850> of

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
wings you don't have the option of

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.090 
wings you don't have the option of
taking<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.300> coroplast<00:00:52.570> wing<00:00:53.079> panels<00:00:53.380> off<00:00:53.770> for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
taking the coroplast wing panels off for

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.650 
taking the coroplast wing panels off for
the<00:00:54.160> vertical<00:00:54.490> stabilizers<00:00:55.150> and<00:00:55.300> usually

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
the vertical stabilizers and usually

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.300 
the vertical stabilizers and usually
that's<00:00:55.780> what<00:00:56.079> gets<00:00:56.230> hanger<00:00:56.680> rash<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.100> worst

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
that's what gets hanger rash the worst

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.370 
that's what gets hanger rash the worst
I'm<00:00:58.090> not<00:00:58.210> going<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.450> plug<00:00:58.630> up<00:00:58.750> all<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.020> servos

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
I'm not going to plug up all the servos

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.950 
I'm not going to plug up all the servos
and<00:00:59.440> everything<00:00:59.980> at<00:01:00.460> this<00:01:00.880> moment<00:01:01.180> but<00:01:01.540> i<00:01:01.750> just

lifesaver you have a big plane you have
a<00:01:21.070> small<00:01:21.430> car<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:22.299> can<00:01:22.450> still<00:01:22.659> transport<00:01:23.229> it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
a small car you can still transport it

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.260 
a small car you can still transport it
with<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.500> drag<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.710> are<00:01:27.040> right<00:01:27.790> now<00:01:27.940> it's

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
with the drag there are right now it's

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.480 
with the drag there are right now it's
the<00:01:28.570> two<00:01:29.320> wings<00:01:29.530> are<00:01:29.680> held<00:01:29.860> together<00:01:29.979> with<00:01:30.220> the

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
the two wings are held together with the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.730 
the two wings are held together with the
same<00:01:30.820> o<00:01:31.150> rings<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:33.280> z3<00:01:34.119> has<00:01:35.049> but<00:01:35.560> on<00:01:35.650> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
same o rings that the z3 has but on the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.140 
same o rings that the z3 has but on the
production<00:01:36.190> version<00:01:36.369> it's<00:01:36.729> actually<00:01:37.060> going

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
production version it's actually going

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.370 
production version it's actually going
to<00:01:37.240> clip<00:01:37.450> in<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.720> it's<00:01:37.840> going<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.020> be<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> bit

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
to clip in and it's going to be a bit

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.570 
to clip in and it's going to be a bit
different<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.890> I'm<00:01:38.979> not<00:01:39.070> going<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.250> spend<00:01:39.430> too

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
different so I'm not going to spend too

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.580 
different so I'm not going to spend too
much<00:01:39.729> time<00:01:39.790> showing<00:01:40.299> you<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.810> just<00:01:41.350> wanted

to show you how easy this thing was to

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.870 
to show you how easy this thing was to
put<00:01:43.690> together<00:01:43.810> how<00:01:44.619> compact<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.430> breaks<00:01:45.729> down

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
put together how compact it breaks down

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.289 
put together how compact it breaks down
and<00:01:46.390> i<00:01:46.780> want<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:46.990> remind<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:49.270> have
