some downhill trousers nice and warm but

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.570 
some downhill trousers nice and warm but
they<00:02:04.259> also<00:02:04.380> offer<00:02:04.770> some<00:02:05.130> good<00:02:05.250> protection

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
they also offer some good protection

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.390 
they also offer some good protection
Oh<00:02:07.170> protection<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.260> a<00:02:08.320> really<00:02:08.650> good<00:02:08.800> idea

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
Oh protection is a really good idea

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.110 
Oh protection is a really good idea
especially<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.360> dusty<00:02:10.900> or<00:02:11.080> muddy<00:02:11.320> conditions

good idea gloves I realize that some of

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.420 
good idea gloves I realize that some of
the<00:02:25.450> world's<00:02:25.750> top<00:02:25.960> pro<00:02:26.230> downhillers<00:02:26.770> don't

you<00:03:06.850> more<00:03:07.060> protection<00:03:07.270> than<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.870> pair<00:03:08.110> of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
you more protection than a pair of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.160 
you more protection than a pair of
cross-country<00:03:08.800> shoes<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.750> weather<00:03:10.959> can

cross-country shoes the weather can

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.690 
cross-country shoes the weather can
change<00:03:11.200> really<00:03:11.680> quickly<00:03:12.100> in<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.280> mountains

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
change really quickly in the mountains

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.130 
change really quickly in the mountains
so<00:03:12.910> it's<00:03:12.940> important<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.630> have<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.840> rain<00:03:14.110> jacket

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140
