00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.690
 but give less than 10 minutes 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.390
 we had that magic wand 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.490
 this season the exceptions and 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.799
 wigs are very fashionable if a 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.410
 day we can have short hair and another day 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.119
 we can go to work with 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.369
 extensions and nobody is going to realize and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.460
 on the contrary they are going to give 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.340
 comments like me happened to me when I 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.670
 I put these extensions are already old 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.040
 that's why they see them this way a little bit 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.770
 great distance but it fascinates me because 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.289
 the natural cmb the people that do not 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.839
 know and know that I have short hair 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.969
 for the night that anime says the down 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.370
 they ask something you have but they are 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.059
 extensions and only writes me to 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.829
 talk like jonas use because they do 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.780
 like we have short hair or 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.600
 good people who have hair 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.300
 short and they want to use extensions sometimes 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.280
 to the clips are shown to us in the part 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.329
 of the head let's start to fix 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.149
 The hair 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.010
 I'm going to be using this little brush that 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.799
 I bought the sales store and it's one of my 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.440
 favorites because here in the teeth 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.980
 it also has another meaning nothing more 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 to give you hair like that 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.470
 we started to put the dog in front 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.210
 let's make a pigtail and start 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.630
 assemble the back 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.690
 I have very thin hair and I have 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 to tell it enough for the hair 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.170
 be seen 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.060
 more stuffed we're just going to do it 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.780
 in this part of the head 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.550
 here we are going to start cutting another 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.480
 little bit now let's put spray 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.000
 we have to have an edge like that 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 I recommend you use a spray of 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.860
 number 4 which is the strongest and also 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.520
 you are given this volume and it leaves you so 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.400
 the peru already durito so it is what comes 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.120
 easier now let's paste the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.160
 extensions at the bottom 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.160
 where is not we cut the hair 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.420
 and we started to put the hair back 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.420
 and make sure that to the clips that 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.519
 side are comfortable because sometimes at 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.860
 time and end of the queue you 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.989
 they are dating a little horse 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.319
 half stuck there is the one that most 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.220
 it hurts so now we are going to form 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.220
 our queue 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.880
 now we are going to accommodate these hairs 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.520
 loose and I recommend a brush that 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.640
 have teeth a little hard and 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.190
 that has very smooth this also what 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.620
 you can find in zhanish and now we go 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.060
 to go hitting 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.560
 so that the hair looks smooth and does not 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.830
 look with stool 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.349
 the hairs noisy with the taste and 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.970
 thematic we have had this long hair 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.340
 so you keep hoping there's 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.860
 liked these tips you can also 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.890
 find on facebook on instagram and in 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.540
 twitter in your comment to me was left 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.120

 petition you can also visit the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.360

 of makeup and I did very badly that is 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.890
 I leave it for you to see 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.190

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.190
