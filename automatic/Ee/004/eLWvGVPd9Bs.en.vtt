00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.330
 as I do so much of partners universe is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.189
 good morning I am transition thing of this 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.420
 department is important 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:30.270
 While lawyers 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.270
 like french 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 all chemistry 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 what you have to take into account a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.220
 entrepreneur is that he in his role and his 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.930
 position differs the person 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.930
 and they are reflected in the partners' agreement 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.300
 in general an education more than more than 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.930
 permanence of the company that a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.660
 investor 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.400
 and that you will have to take care a lot 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.300
 example the capsules of 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.300
 and permanence 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.630
 and also by the way 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 will receive the entrepreneur while 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 all right 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.950
 the company will be limited this 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.840
 retribution and the entrepreneur I sing it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.600
 I was noticing the fixed illusion as 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.790
 very important variable for example in 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.330
 the variable compensation 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.330
 often conditioned 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.619
 as we all know is a person who 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.990
 he has his money and he has to make money 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.840
 In this state 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.500
 the image of the company is very 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.500
 important 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:22.150
 they are very simple it does not have to be more than 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.040
 a person the investor or the partner 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.659
 majority of the cases that can 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.840
 drag the rest of the partners of the 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.280
 company to sell its shares in 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 the audience to sell gas to a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.800
 determined price 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.730
 thank you the heel that is against 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.650
 when he is one of the partners of his 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.800
 participation in the company the rest of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.310
 partners have the right to accompany her 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.700
 for the entrepreneur they are very important 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.470
 even before the agreement of partners with a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.710
 investor and in the valuation of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.710
 company 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.430
 in the end it is what will determine what 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.450
 patient what percentage of participation 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.760
 about him 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.200
 importance one thing that I find myself 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.629
 also a lot with entrepreneurs 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.000

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.800
 name of the company but that the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.450
 they have the personal article is very 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.940
 important and even to sell your 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.370

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.940

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.940
 business of the company 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.650

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.170

 associated costs 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.030
 these things 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.240
 that is not always getting the 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.220
