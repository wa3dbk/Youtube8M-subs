well<00:01:54.090> first<00:01:54.330> thing<00:01:54.480> I'll<00:01:54.630> point<00:01:54.660> out<00:01:55.140> bike

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
well first thing I'll point out bike

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.860 
well first thing I'll point out bike
makes<00:01:55.920> eighty-one<00:01:56.400> horsepower<00:01:56.910> and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
makes eighty-one horsepower and

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.060 
makes eighty-one horsepower and
basically<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.320> hundred<00:01:58.470> foot-pounds<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
basically a hundred foot-pounds of

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.440 
basically a hundred foot-pounds of
