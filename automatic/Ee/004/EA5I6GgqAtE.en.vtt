00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
in the beginning was like 16 17 but now

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.610 
in the beginning was like 16 17 but now
we<00:02:51.330> have<00:02:51.450> been<00:02:51.750> doing<00:02:52.970> 25<00:02:53.970> miles<00:02:54.620> sometimes

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.650 
we have been doing 25 miles sometimes
like<00:02:55.950> yesterday<00:02:56.370> we<00:02:56.660> did<00:02:57.660> 29<00:02:59.540> but<00:03:00.540> that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
like yesterday we did 29 but that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.470 
like yesterday we did 29 but that
depends<00:03:01.019> on<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> terrine<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.560> course<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:02.190> you

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
depends on the terrine of course if you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.650 
depends on the terrine of course if you
like<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.660> there<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.049> high<00:03:04.260> sierra<00:03:05.540> think<00:03:06.540> it's

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
like in there and high sierra think it's

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.270 
like in there and high sierra think it's
kind<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.959> hard<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.290> work<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.769> five<00:03:08.040> miles

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
kind of hard to work just five miles

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.039 
kind of hard to work just five miles
because<00:03:08.579> you<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.150> have<00:03:09.239> made<00:03:09.420> your<00:03:09.569> costs

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
because you have to have made your costs

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.390 
because you have to have made your costs
climbs<00:03:10.620> from<00:03:10.859> up<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.609> 2,000<00:03:12.510> feet<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:14.370> that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
climbs from up to 2,000 feet so that

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.050 
climbs from up to 2,000 feet so that
then<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> will<00:03:15.329> be<00:03:15.420> difficult<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:16.790> do<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.880> walk

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
then it will be difficult to do you walk

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.680 
then it will be difficult to do you walk
