00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.010 

but<00:00:31.039> it's<00:00:31.189> been<00:00:31.369> this<00:00:31.580> quest<00:00:32.390> for<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:32.899> many

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
but it's been this quest for so many

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.380 
but it's been this quest for so many
composers<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.920> see<00:00:34.100> well<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.879> couple<00:00:35.300> of

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
composers to see well the couple of

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.650 
composers to see well the couple of
fragments<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:35.930> he<00:00:36.050> did<00:00:36.260> leave<00:00:36.739> as<00:00:37.070> as<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
fragments that he did leave as as the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.389 
fragments that he did leave as as the
starting<00:00:39.019> point<00:00:39.079> for<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.680> scarce<00:00:40.040> movement

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399

for<00:00:40.550> example<00:00:40.940> should<00:00:41.570> be<00:00:42.579> possibly

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
for example should be possibly

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.509 
for example should be possibly
orchestrated<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.890> seems<00:00:46.129> like<00:00:46.250> some

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
orchestrated and it seems like some

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.280 
orchestrated and it seems like some
people<00:00:46.550> have<00:00:46.879> quite<00:00:47.420> obsessively<00:00:47.900> not<00:00:48.140> been
