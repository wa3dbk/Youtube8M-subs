right here
and<00:01:37.679> then<00:01:37.950> close<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.399> pattern<00:01:38.729> picker<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
and then close the pattern picker you

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.599 
and then close the pattern picker you
can<00:01:39.750> change<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.289> scale<00:01:40.649> of<00:01:40.679> that<00:01:40.979> pattern<00:01:41.280> by

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
can change the scale of that pattern by

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.520 
can change the scale of that pattern by
dragging<00:01:41.969> the<00:01:42.060> slider

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
dragging the slider

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.100 
dragging the slider
you'll<00:01:43.890> find<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.549> image<00:01:44.850> appears<00:01:45.570> much

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you'll find that the image appears much

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.370 
you'll find that the image appears much
more<00:01:46.380> clear<00:01:46.950> when<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.909> 100%<00:01:49.070> 200%<00:01:50.070> or

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
more clear when it's at 100% 200% or

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.969 
more clear when it's at 100% 200% or
400%

400%

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.630 
400%
let's<00:01:53.250> try<00:01:54.049> 200%<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.650> see<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.950> clarity<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
let's try 200% you see the clarity and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.560 
let's try 200% you see the clarity and
if<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.119> change<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:58.130> 199<00:01:59.180> look<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.330> how<00:02:00.450> much

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
if I change this to 199 look at how much

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.320 
if I change this to 199 look at how much
more<00:02:00.780> blurry<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.380> appears<00:02:01.800> go<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.759> 200

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
more blurry it appears go back to 200

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.740 
more blurry it appears go back to 200
try<00:02:03.810> 201<00:02:04.440> it's<00:02:05.070> blurry<00:02:05.460> again<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.420> you're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
try 201 it's blurry again so you're

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
try 201 it's blurry again so you're
gonna<00:02:06.899> get<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.259> best<00:02:07.470> results<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.220> these

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
gonna get the best results at these

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.120 
gonna get the best results at these
scales<00:02:09.479> which<00:02:09.810> are<00:02:09.959> increments<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.830> hundred

open you can drag the pattern on the
screen<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.750> particular<00:02:22.320> case<00:02:22.560> it

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
screen in this particular case it

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.860 
screen in this particular case it
doesn't<00:02:23.040> much<00:02:23.160> matter<00:02:23.269> because<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.450> pattern

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
doesn't much matter because this pattern

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.860 
doesn't much matter because this pattern
is<00:02:25.080> organic<00:02:25.890> however<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.820> had<00:02:27.030> say<00:02:27.630> a

is organic however if you had say a
cross<00:02:28.200> hatching<00:02:28.680> pattern<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.730> might<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
cross hatching pattern you might want to

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.150 
cross hatching pattern you might want to
line<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.840> cross<00:02:31.170> hatching<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.800> some<00:02:32.040> of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
line up the cross hatching with some of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.699 
line up the cross hatching with some of
the<00:02:32.280> geometry<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.290> helpful

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
the geometry and this can be helpful

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.100 
the geometry and this can be helpful
it's<00:02:35.340> also<00:02:35.550> useful<00:02:35.850> with<00:02:36.180> tiling<00:02:36.690> patterns

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it's also useful with tiling patterns

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.890 
it's also useful with tiling patterns
you<00:02:37.860> can<00:02:38.040> line<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.459> ceramic<00:02:39.150> tile<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
you can line up the ceramic tile in this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.000 
you can line up the ceramic tile in this
way<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.400> want<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.640> countertop<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:43.019> be<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.980> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
way I want this countertop to be like a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.210 
way I want this countertop to be like a
granite<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.390> want<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> color<00:02:46.590> so

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
granite but I want it to have a color so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.390 
granite but I want it to have a color so
I'm<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.640> use<00:02:47.880> color<00:02:48.209> overlay<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.400> I'll

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
I'm going to use color overlay and I'll

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.890 
I'm going to use color overlay and I'll
choose<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> color<00:02:51.060> up<00:02:51.360> here

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.649 

now<00:02:54.500> if<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.739> do<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:55.129> it<00:02:55.670> appears<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.239> the

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
now if I do that it appears that the

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.470 
now if I do that it appears that the
color<00:02:56.900> overlay<00:02:57.580> completely<00:02:58.580> obscures<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
color overlay completely obscures the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.869 
color overlay completely obscures the
pattern<00:02:59.989> overlay<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:01.129> that's<00:03:01.340> happening

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
pattern overlay and that's happening

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.210 
pattern overlay and that's happening
because<00:03:02.269> these<00:03:02.540> effects<00:03:03.049> form<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.769> kind<00:03:03.980> of

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
because these effects form a kind of

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.539 
because these effects form a kind of
stack<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:06.110> color<00:03:06.709> overlay<00:03:07.159> is<00:03:07.310> higher

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
stack and this color overlay is higher

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.089 
stack and this color overlay is higher
up<00:03:07.819> than<00:03:08.180> pattern<00:03:08.659> overlay<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.739> it's

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
up than pattern overlay so it's

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.059 
up than pattern overlay so it's
obscuring<00:03:10.700> what's<00:03:11.209> below<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:11.629> here<00:03:12.110> in<00:03:12.829> order

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
obscuring what's below it here in order

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.759 
obscuring what's below it here in order
to<00:03:13.190> blend<00:03:13.519> these<00:03:13.700> two<00:03:13.970> effects<00:03:14.329> together<00:03:14.769> it's

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
to blend these two effects together it's

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.890 
to blend these two effects together it's
necessary<00:03:16.430> either<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.150> change<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.659> blend

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
decrease the opacity here you can see

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.080 
decrease the opacity here you can see
that<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.409> starts<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.920> blend<00:03:25.129> with<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.730> pattern

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090

overlay<00:03:40.020> works<00:03:41.020> pretty<00:03:41.500> well<00:03:41.620> although<00:03:42.160> it's

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
overlay works pretty well although it's

a bit too intense soft light is

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.059 
a bit too intense soft light is
interesting<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.230> think<00:03:47.440> I'll<00:03:47.560> go<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:47.709> soft

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
interesting I think I'll go with soft

interesting I think I'll go with soft
light

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910

click<00:03:50.030> on<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.330> color<00:03:50.540> swatch<00:03:50.720> now<00:03:51.140> now<00:03:51.770> that

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
click on the color swatch now now that

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.710 
click on the color swatch now now that
we're<00:03:52.100> seeing<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.520> blend<00:03:52.820> between<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
we're seeing the blend between the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.840 
we're seeing the blend between the
pattern<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> color<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.860> then<00:03:55.490> I<00:03:55.550> can

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
pattern and the color and then I can

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.180 
pattern and the color and then I can
make<00:03:56.450> some<00:03:56.720> other<00:03:56.810> decisions<00:03:57.410> perhaps<00:03:57.800> if<00:03:58.100> I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
make some other decisions perhaps if I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.940 
make some other decisions perhaps if I
change<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.700> hue<00:03:59.140> we<00:04:00.140> can<00:04:00.320> try<00:04:00.530> some<00:04:00.770> other

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
change the hue we can try some other

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.030 
change the hue we can try some other
type<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.400> exotic<00:04:01.700> granite<00:04:02.420> for<00:04:02.780> example<00:04:03.260> try

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
type of exotic granite for example try

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.130 
type of exotic granite for example try
this<00:04:04.100> greenish<00:04:04.940> color

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
this greenish color

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.190 
this greenish color
so<00:04:07.710> this<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:08.010> one<00:04:08.250> way<00:04:08.460> that<00:04:08.490> we<00:04:08.850> could<00:04:09.090> mix<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
so this is one way that we could mix the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.400 
so this is one way that we could mix the
color<00:04:11.010> overlay<00:04:11.520> with<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.600> pattern<00:04:12.990> with<00:04:13.320> a

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
color overlay with the pattern with a

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.500 
color overlay with the pattern with a
grayscale<00:04:13.950> pattern<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:15.000> there<00:04:15.180> are<00:04:15.300> also

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
grayscale pattern but there are also

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.930 
grayscale pattern but there are also
situations<00:04:15.930> where<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.709> might<00:04:16.890> have<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.489> color

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
situations where you might have a color

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.360 
situations where you might have a color
pattern<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.630> you'd<00:04:19.200> like<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.530> change<00:04:19.769> its<00:04:20.070> hue

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.630 
looking for as a texture that I like we
can<00:04:45.230> always<00:04:45.470> change<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.920> color<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.610> a

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
can always change the color this is a

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.210 
can always change the color this is a
rather<00:04:46.880> interesting<00:04:47.270> texture<00:04:48.050> I'll<00:04:48.860> go<00:04:49.100> with

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
rather interesting texture I'll go with

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.940 
rather interesting texture I'll go with
this<00:04:49.340> one<00:04:49.400> this<00:04:50.300> is<00:04:50.420> called<00:04:50.660> blue<00:04:50.990> specs

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.080 

go<00:04:54.160> back<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.700> color<00:04:55.150> overlay<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.160> if<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.520> use

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
go back to color overlay and if I use

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.880 
go back to color overlay and if I use
this<00:04:58.300> green<00:04:58.720> color<00:04:59.050> it's<00:04:59.290> going<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.770> be

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
this green color it's going to be

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.910 
this green color it's going to be
dynamically<00:05:00.580> mixing<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:01.420> with<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.920> lavender

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
dynamically mixing it with the lavender

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.700 
dynamically mixing it with the lavender
color<00:05:02.950> of<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:04.000> pattern<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.780> get<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.960> cleaner

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
color of the pattern to get a cleaner

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.910 
color of the pattern to get a cleaner
mix<00:05:06.370> I'm<00:05:06.730> going<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.390> strip<00:05:07.750> away<00:05:07.780> all<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.440> the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
mix I'm going to strip away all of the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.250 
mix I'm going to strip away all of the
color<00:05:09.190> from<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.730> pattern<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.420> that's

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
color from this pattern and that's

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.560 
color from this pattern and that's
easily<00:05:11.560> done<00:05:11.800> simply<00:05:12.490> by<00:05:12.670> changing<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.300> blend

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
easily done simply by changing the blend

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.100 
easily done simply by changing the blend
mode<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.170> pattern<00:05:14.590> to<00:05:15.430> luminosity<00:05:16.110> so

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
mode of the pattern to luminosity so

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.480 
mode of the pattern to luminosity so
we're<00:05:17.260> just<00:05:17.440> getting<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.920> grayscale

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
we're just getting the grayscale

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.030 
we're just getting the grayscale
information<00:05:19.180> or<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.660> luminosity<00:05:20.170> of<00:05:20.590> this

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
information or the luminosity of this

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.610 
information or the luminosity of this
particular<00:05:21.670> pattern<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.330> then<00:05:22.900> we're<00:05:23.080> mixing

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
particular pattern and then we're mixing

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.370 
particular pattern and then we're mixing
in<00:05:23.830> whatever<00:05:24.310> color<00:05:24.730> we<00:05:25.000> want<00:05:25.240> here<00:05:25.660> with<00:05:26.260> the

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
in whatever color we want here with the

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.010 
in whatever color we want here with the
color<00:05:26.620> overlay<00:05:27.130> effect<00:05:27.570> I'll<00:05:28.570> open<00:05:28.870> this

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
color overlay effect I'll open this

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.350 
color overlay effect I'll open this
color<00:05:29.290> swatch<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.980> I'll<00:05:30.850> try<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.120> different

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
color swatch and I'll try a different

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.420 
color swatch and I'll try a different
color

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.749 

so<00:05:37.000> this<00:05:37.509> system<00:05:38.320> allows<00:05:38.620> us<00:05:39.160> great

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
so this system allows us great

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.090 
so this system allows us great
flexibility<00:05:40.630> because<00:05:41.110> we<00:05:41.440> can<00:05:41.680> very<00:05:41.860> easily

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
flexibility because we can very easily

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.600 
flexibility because we can very easily
make<00:05:42.669> decisions<00:05:43.360> about<00:05:43.900> texture<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:45.370> about

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
make decisions about texture and about

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.909 
make decisions about texture and about
color<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.210> we<00:05:46.870> can<00:05:47.020> have<00:05:47.169> independent

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
color and we can have independent

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.690 
color and we can have independent
control<00:05:48.280> over<00:05:48.699> each

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
control over each

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.600 
control over each
and<00:05:50.790> furthermore<00:05:51.660> we<00:05:52.440> have<00:05:52.650> this<00:05:52.830> ability<00:05:53.160> to

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
and furthermore we have this ability to

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.960 
and furthermore we have this ability to
go<00:05:54.090> back<00:05:54.300> in<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:54.840> future<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:55.440> make<00:05:56.160> changes

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
go back in the future and make changes

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.540 
go back in the future and make changes
to<00:05:57.030> these<00:05:57.360> material<00:05:58.020> choices<00:05:58.430> simply<00:05:59.430> by

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
to these material choices simply by

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.150 
to these material choices simply by
changing<00:05:59.850> the<00:06:00.540> layer<00:06:01.050> effect<00:06:01.500> which<00:06:02.010> is

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
changing the layer effect which is

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.850 
changing the layer effect which is
listed<00:06:02.400> here<00:06:02.610> so<00:06:03.510> in<00:06:03.630> this<00:06:03.780> video<00:06:03.960> you've

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
listed here so in this video you've

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.190 
listed here so in this video you've
learned<00:06:05.160> how<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.580> manage<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.480> relationship

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
learned how to manage the relationship

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.160 
learned how to manage the relationship
between<00:06:07.470> pattern<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.340> color<00:06:09.030> through<00:06:09.690> layer

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
between pattern and color through layer

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:18.340 
between pattern and color through layer
style<00:06:10.560> effects
