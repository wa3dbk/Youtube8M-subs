on<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> concerns<00:00:56.879> me<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.390> bit

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
on it so that concerns me a little bit

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
on it so that concerns me a little bit
but<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.469> point<00:00:58.739> I'd<00:00:59.070> highly<00:00:59.370> recommend

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
but at this point I'd highly recommend

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.139 
but at this point I'd highly recommend
it<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.000> planting<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> East<00:01:02.149> the

second cherry I want to talk about was

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.380 
second cherry I want to talk about was
is<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.510> Benton<00:01:07.580> Benton<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.820> formerly

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
is is Benton Benton was formerly

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
is is Benton Benton was formerly
Columbia<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.770> Washington<00:01:11.280> State<00:01:11.670> couldn't

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
Columbia but Washington State couldn't

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.359 
Columbia but Washington State couldn't
get<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.380> trademark<00:01:13.380> patent<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.159> name

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
get a trademark patent on that name

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.929 
get a trademark patent on that name
probably<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.060> obvious<00:01:15.390> reasons<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.939> Benton

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
probably for obvious reasons but Benton

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.609 
probably for obvious reasons but Benton
also<00:01:18.240> seems<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.960> nice<00:01:19.140> cherry

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
also seems like a really nice cherry

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.570 
also seems like a really nice cherry
it's<00:01:20.520> had<00:01:20.729> very<00:01:20.759> high<00:01:21.390> soluble<00:01:21.930> solids<00:01:22.430> for<00:01:23.430> us

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's had very high soluble solids for us

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
it's had very high soluble solids for us
here<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:23.939> 19<00:01:24.540> 20<00:01:24.869> percent<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> very

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
here about 19 20 percent which is very

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.530 
here about 19 20 percent which is very
odd<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.330> also<00:01:27.509> impressed<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.170> Benton<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
odd so I'm also impressed with Benton I

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.460 
odd so I'm also impressed with Benton I
should<00:01:30.540> mention<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.960> I've<00:01:31.140> already

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
should mention that I've already
