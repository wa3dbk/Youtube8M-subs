about<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:17.609> sar-21<00:00:18.609> assault<00:00:19.480> rifle<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.050> how

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
about the sar-21 assault rifle and how

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.350 
about the sar-21 assault rifle and how
to<00:00:20.650> control<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.580> recoil<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:24.250> sar-21<00:00:24.820> is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
to control the recoil the sar-21 is

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.939 
to control the recoil the sar-21 is
quickly<00:00:25.660> becoming<00:00:26.110> one<00:00:26.260> of<00:00:26.380> my<00:00:26.560> favorite

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
quickly becoming one of my favorite

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.100 
quickly becoming one of my favorite
assault<00:00:27.310> rifles<00:00:27.730> despite<00:00:28.449> having<00:00:28.690> the<00:00:28.930> low

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
assault rifles despite having the low

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.650 
assault rifles despite having the low
rate<00:00:29.320> of<00:00:29.350> fire<00:00:29.740> coming<00:00:30.400> in<00:00:30.580> at<00:00:30.730> 600<00:00:31.240> rounds<00:00:31.390> per

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.729 
rate of fire coming in at 600 rounds per
minute<00:00:32.020> it's<00:00:32.590> actually<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:34.090> good<00:00:34.449> if<00:00:35.170> you

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
minute it's actually really good if you

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.500 
minute it's actually really good if you
get<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.039> jump<00:00:36.280> on<00:00:36.430> your<00:00:36.640> opponents<00:00:37.120> or<00:00:37.210> if<00:00:37.359> you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
get the jump on your opponents or if you

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.189 
get the jump on your opponents or if you
play<00:00:37.750> with<00:00:38.500> a<00:00:38.559> slower<00:00:38.979> pace<00:00:39.579> on<00:00:40.510> specific<00:00:41.050> game

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
types like domination now I actually

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.869 
types like domination now I actually

trying to run and gun with the SAR I

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.200 
trying to run and gun with the SAR I
tried<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.469> early<00:00:51.069> on<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.489> it<00:00:51.819> doesn't

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
tried that early on and it doesn't

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.099 
tried that early on and it doesn't
really<00:00:52.569> bode<00:00:52.929> well<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:54.579> anyone<00:00:55.510> that's<00:00:55.659> going

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
really bode well for anyone that's going

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.709 
really bode well for anyone that's going
up<00:00:56.319> against<00:00:56.739> you<00:00:56.829> know<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.949> famas<00:00:57.339> or<00:00:57.670> ace<00:00:58.149> 23

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
up against you know a famas or ace 23

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.979 
up against you know a famas or ace 23
which<00:00:59.199> you<00:00:59.350> typically<00:00:59.649> see<00:00:59.769> in<00:00:59.949> down<00:01:00.309> games

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
which you typically see in down games

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.380 
which you typically see in down games
the<00:01:01.989> recoil<00:01:02.409> on<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.799> SAR<00:01:03.190> kicks<00:01:03.519> almost

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
the recoil on the SAR kicks almost

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.480 
the recoil on the SAR kicks almost
directly<00:01:04.839> upwards<00:01:05.530> compensating<00:01:06.310> for<00:01:06.430> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
directly upwards compensating for the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.370 
directly upwards compensating for the
recoil<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.090> fairly<00:01:07.390> straightforward<00:01:07.810> I

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
recoil is fairly straightforward I

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.380 
recoil is fairly straightforward I
typically<00:01:09.070> shoot<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:09.490> four<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:09.940> six<00:01:09.970> shot

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
typically shoot in four to six shot

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.100 
typically shoot in four to six shot
burst<00:01:10.690> while<00:01:11.560> holding<00:01:12.280> down<00:01:12.460> word<00:01:12.910> on<00:01:13.750> the

there<00:01:17.290> tactics<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.160> I<00:01:18.280> utilize<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:19.120> most

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
there tactics that I utilize the most

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.150 
there tactics that I utilize the most
whenever<00:01:20.140> i'm<00:01:20.260> using<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.590> sar-21<00:01:21.390> for

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
whenever i'm using the sar-21 for

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.710 
whenever i'm using the sar-21 for
offense<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:24.340> capturing<00:01:24.760> points<00:01:25.330> for

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
offense and capturing points for

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.350 
offense and capturing points for
domination<00:01:26.440> specifically<00:01:27.220> involve<00:01:28.000> going

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
domination specifically involve going

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.390 
domination specifically involve going
the<00:01:28.660> route<00:01:28.900> less<00:01:29.290> traveled<00:01:29.860> as<00:01:29.980> i<00:01:30.370> mentioned

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
the route less traveled as i mentioned

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.850 
the route less traveled as i mentioned
previously<00:01:30.790> i<00:01:31.150> don't<00:01:31.510> really<00:01:31.750> like<00:01:32.080> going

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
previously i don't really like going

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.370 
previously i don't really like going
head-on<00:01:33.690> specifically<00:01:34.690> for<00:01:34.900> domination

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
head-on specifically for domination

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.100 
head-on specifically for domination
because<00:01:35.950> i<00:01:35.980> tend<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.430> find<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.300> rate<00:01:38.080> of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
because i tend to find that the rate of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.500 
because i tend to find that the rate of
fire<00:01:38.410> really<00:01:39.190> hinders<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.820> performance<00:01:40.390> of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
fire really hinders the performance of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.670 
fire really hinders the performance of
the<00:01:40.720> weapon<00:01:41.050> you<00:01:41.920> run<00:01:42.100> up<00:01:42.190> against<00:01:42.520> age<00:01:42.670> 23<00:01:43.300> s

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the weapon you run up against age 23 s

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.620 
the weapon you run up against age 23 s
m249<00:01:44.680> s<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.700> lot<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.090> other<00:01:46.210> weapons

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
m249 s and a lot of the other weapons

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.890 
m249 s and a lot of the other weapons
that<00:01:46.750> have<00:01:46.810> basically<00:01:47.740> all<00:01:48.150> have<00:01:49.150> higher

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
that have basically all have higher

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.990 
that have basically all have higher
rates<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.290> fire<00:01:50.350> than<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:50.920> SAR<00:01:51.370> so<00:01:51.610> you'll<00:01:51.790> see

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
rates of fire than the SAR so you'll see

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.300 
rates of fire than the SAR so you'll see
that<00:01:52.150> you'll<00:01:52.360> end<00:01:52.659> up<00:01:52.930> getting<00:01:53.230> like<00:01:53.470> 75

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
that you'll end up getting like 75

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.430 
that you'll end up getting like 75
points<00:01:54.640> worth<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.150> damage<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.810> other<00:01:56.230> guy

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
points worth of damage and the other guy

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.460 
points worth of damage and the other guy
gets<00:01:56.740> away<00:01:56.980> clean<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.640> he<00:01:58.030> kills<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.840> got<00:01:59.440> a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
gets away clean and he kills you I got a

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.290 
gets away clean and he kills you I got a
lot<00:01:59.650> of<00:01:59.680> engagements<00:02:00.310> where<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.790> couldn't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
lot of engagements where I couldn't

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.149 
lot of engagements where I couldn't
quite<00:02:01.630> get<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.990> kill<00:02:02.200> before<00:02:02.380> they<00:02:02.710> killed<00:02:02.979> me

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
quite get the kill before they killed me

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.190 
quite get the kill before they killed me
whenever<00:02:03.820> we<00:02:04.030> were<00:02:04.210> in<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.479> stalemate

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
whenever we were in a stalemate

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.140 
whenever we were in a stalemate
situation<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:06.250> we<00:02:06.310> both<00:02:06.490> saw<00:02:06.670> each<00:02:06.820> other<00:02:06.940> at

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
situation and we both saw each other at

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.640 
situation and we both saw each other at
about<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.540> same<00:02:07.570> time<00:02:09.060> defense<00:02:10.260> I'd<00:02:11.260> say<00:02:11.620> that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
about the same time defense I'd say that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.339 
about the same time defense I'd say that
I'm<00:02:11.890> mostly<00:02:12.310> playing<00:02:12.640> as<00:02:12.819> own<00:02:13.090> style<00:02:13.659> of<00:02:13.959> play

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
I'm mostly playing as own style of play

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.309 
I'm mostly playing as own style of play
when<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> have<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.310> SAR<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.299> if<00:02:16.629> I'm<00:02:16.810> at<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:16.989> point

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
when I have the SAR so if I'm at a point

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.190 
when I have the SAR so if I'm at a point
and<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:17.859> have

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
and we have

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.510 
and we have
control<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.980> don't<00:02:19.190> really<00:02:19.310> feel

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
control of it and I don't really feel

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.430 
control of it and I don't really feel
like<00:02:19.550> moving<00:02:20.030> too<00:02:20.180> much<00:02:20.209> I'm<00:02:20.720> going<00:02:21.319> to

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
like moving too much I'm going to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.140 
like moving too much I'm going to
basically<00:02:21.920> play<00:02:22.250> zone<00:02:22.489> defense<00:02:22.550> which

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
basically play zone defense which

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.270 
basically play zone defense which
involves<00:02:23.569> roaming<00:02:23.930> around<00:02:24.019> different<00:02:24.379> access

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
involves roaming around different access

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.330 
involves roaming around different access
points<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.849> capture<00:02:26.420> site<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.739> SAR

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
points to that capture site with the SAR

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.119 
points to that capture site with the SAR
that<00:02:28.790> way<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.330> jump<00:02:29.569> on<00:02:29.690> people<00:02:30.129> they

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
that way I get the jump on people they

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.550 
that way I get the jump on people they
