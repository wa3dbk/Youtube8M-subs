00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.840
 in this video we will solve the equation 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.530
 trigonometric of xx x thing 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.290
 equal to following three match by four 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.900
 if one has reviewed and practiced with 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.599
 the formulas of some double angles 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.689
 half then if you think in sine of x by 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.780
 cosine of x something very similar appears in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.820
 one of those formulas 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:31.180
 appears 2x by consumption of x2 xx 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.180
 x 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 is the breast 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.890
 of 2 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.940
 then if we pass this 2 dividing the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.250
 another part we will have to notice x by 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:54.160
 cosine of x which is the first part 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.680
 of the equality that they raise us of the 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.140
 equation these would be 92 x 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.510
 matches so this is two 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 trigonometric ratios transforms into 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 an econometric reason even if it's 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.400
 a double angle that's not going to come right 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.300
 of us from here we would have to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:21.070
 of x by thing not of x is sin of 2x 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.570
 from two is equal to the root of three 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.610
 match of 4 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.130
 we passed the 2 that is dividing into another 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.580
 part multiplying we would have where 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.390
 2x equals 2 root of 3 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.240
 party by four 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.810
 simplifying the 24 we have left to us 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.500
 give 2x 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.550
 is root of 3 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.550
 match of 2 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.510
 once we have arrived here that 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.640
 angles we will first work with the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.520
 first round good comment that the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.430
 trigonometric ratios are periodic and 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.770
 of period 2 pique means that 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.590
 every 2 feet every turn we give to the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.110
 circle because the reasons are repeated 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.650
 trigonometric we are going to look for what 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.390
 angles have by the root sine of three 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.790
 matches of two triangles have 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.660
 breasts root of three parties organizes 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.660
 three matches 2 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.280
 the first 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.460
 in which quadrant will be an angle whose 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.550
 breast is the root of three parties 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.740
 for the breast as we know is the and 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.740
 and root of three parties is positive 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 and positive you have the first 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.200
 quadrant and in the second quadrant 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.790
 the 2x will belong with the angle in 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.530
 question will be in the first 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.880
 quadrant in the second quadrant 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.880
 in the first quadrant 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.160
 it's about three matches for two not 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.920
 only the reasons are known 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.650
 trigonometric of the remarkable angles 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.210
 of the first quadrant that are 0 30 degrees 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.550
 45 60 and 90 degrees and in 33 match by 2 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.990
 corresponds to 60 degrees then we passed 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.150
 to the radial 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.370
 in the second quadrant what angle has 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.370
 by sine root of three parties by 2 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.430
 is an angle that has chenoa 33 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.910
 short matches is an angle that at 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.450
 reduce it to the first quadrant gives us 60 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.130
 degrees let's suppose that this angle 70 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.790
 detects to reduce the first quadrant 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.070
 gives us 60 the reduction formula of 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.340
 second first quadrant is 180 less 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:59.590
 tec is equal to 60 of that we have 180 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.800
 minus 60 equal ate-cta this is left you 120 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.800
 degrees 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.770
 then those are the two angles of the 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.270
 first turn up to 360 degrees whose 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.030
 breast is the root of three parties by two 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.820
 let's move the radials if we do not 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.900
 by the rule of three we are left peter 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.340
 uncles radian and 180 so I'm going to do 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.520
 120 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:32.880
 we apply in 180 xx equals 120 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:35.580
 pi x equals 120 pips 180 00 that we 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.800
 up and down by 6 and we have two left 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.800
 feet thirds and radial 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.039
 perfect 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.350
 we still have then what angles 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.510
 they have as their sine of three parties 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.200
 by two because they are pi thirds and two 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:59.960
 thirds then this 2x will be equal to 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.410
 pi thirds 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.199
 and also two thirds, that is, they are given 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.870
 those two possibilities or one or the other 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:12.979
 but as they spin around, they repeat 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.370
 results this is more 2 cap and be this 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.920
 and any when spinning this more 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.430
 anyone while spinning 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:27.020
 where it belongs az we already have what 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:31.900
 which is worth 2x then x would be equal to pitt 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:36.130
 thirds plus 2 capi split by 2 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.850
 and from here x x would be all these 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:43.509
 possibilities two powers plus two capi 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.310
 split by two where they vary z this 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.199
 that we have left, we have to divide we and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.199
 thirds between two that remains picks these 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.410
 plus two layers of 22 when it goes 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.680
 and here would be 2 between 22 and thirds 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.770
 between 2 because of pi thirds plus cab and 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.050
 then all the values ​​of the form 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.240
 pixels tomás capi and page third more cab 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.129
 and where they would end up are solutions 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.520
 of the equation raised then this is 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:17.389
 the set of all the solutions of 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.389
 the equation raised
