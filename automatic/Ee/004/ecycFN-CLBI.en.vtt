probably have heard of that and most

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.679 
probably have heard of that and most
likely<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.280> definitely<00:01:23.689> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
likely have it but this is definitely a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.260 
likely have it but this is definitely a
lot<00:01:25.470> better<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.009> graphics<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.729> look<00:01:26.970> much

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
lot better the graphics to look much

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.929 
lot better the graphics to look much
nicer<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.560> some<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.189> good<00:01:29.400> songs<00:01:29.640> on

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
nicer they got some really good songs on

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730 
nicer they got some really good songs on
this<00:01:30.060> which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> another<00:01:30.869> good<00:01:31.530> thing<00:01:31.560> about

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
this which is another good thing about

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
this which is another good thing about
this<00:01:32.159> compared<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:33.180> other<00:01:33.390> ones

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
this compared to all those other ones

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.100 
this compared to all those other ones
like<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:35.119> but<00:01:36.119> I'll<00:01:36.509> try<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.930> these

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
like this but I'll try to do these

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.600 
like this but I'll try to do these
sliding<00:01:37.320> ones<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.159> see<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
sliding ones and as you can see what you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
sliding ones and as you can see what you
do<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:38.970> slide<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.479> finger<00:01:39.780> once

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
do is you just slide your finger once

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.789 
do is you just slide your finger once
they<00:01:40.170> pop<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:42.079> but<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.530> tell<00:01:43.680> I'm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
they pop up but as you can tell I'm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
they pop up but as you can tell I'm
missing<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.540> yeah<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
missing all of them but yeah I think you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.020 
missing all of them but yeah I think you
guys<00:01:46.950> pretty<00:01:47.220> much<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> point

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
guys pretty much do get the point

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.219 
guys pretty much do get the point
there's<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.360> too<00:01:48.540> much<00:01:48.689> else<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
there's not too much else in the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
there's not too much else in the
gameplay<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.329> most<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> have

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
gameplay but I know most of you have

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
gameplay but I know most of you have
heard<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.229> Guitar<00:01:52.740> Hero<00:01:53.009> before<00:01:53.689> it's
