really<00:01:22.920> only<00:01:23.070> need<00:01:23.159> three<00:01:23.670> notes<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.270> form<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
really only need three notes to form it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
really only need three notes to form it
in<00:01:24.900> its<00:01:25.710> entirety<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.880> called<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.240> triad<00:01:27.540> so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
in its entirety it's called a triad so

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.130 
in its entirety it's called a triad so
in<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:29.460> case<00:01:30.500> here's<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.720> chord<00:01:33.720> rather

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
in this case here's a see a chord rather

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
in this case here's a see a chord rather
than<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.560> being<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.920> single<00:01:35.189> note<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.790> like

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
than just being a single note is like

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.920 
than just being a single note is like
this<00:01:37.909> see<00:01:38.909> how<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> whole<00:01:39.509> bunch<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
this see how it's a whole bunch of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
this see how it's a whole bunch of
things<00:01:40.400> three<00:01:41.400> notes<00:01:41.640> played<00:01:42.000> together<00:01:42.950> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
things three notes played together and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.999 
things three notes played together and
then<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.000> also<00:01:45.180> throw<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.890> can

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
then you can also throw in and you can

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
then you can also throw in and you can
play<00:01:47.220> those<00:01:47.460> three<00:01:47.700> notes<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.149> many<00:01:48.360> places<00:01:48.990> as

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
play those three notes as many places as

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.280 
play those three notes as many places as

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
all C chord so that's what a chord is

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.160 
all C chord so that's what a chord is
it's<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.780> collection<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.640> notes<00:02:43.640> that

have a similar structure no matter what
they're<00:02:56.360> based<00:02:56.600> on<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.620> then<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:58.250> we<00:02:58.970> talked

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
they're based on but then as we talked

is structured around a scene so that's
