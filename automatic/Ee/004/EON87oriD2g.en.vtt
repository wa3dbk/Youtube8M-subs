00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
down and up but I like to just basically

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.780 
down and up but I like to just basically
take<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> water<00:00:34.770> path<00:00:35.010> down<00:00:35.190> where<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.610> just

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
take the water path down where you just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.080 
take the water path down where you just
fall<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> way<00:00:36.329> down<00:00:36.510> into<00:00:37.790> two<00:00:38.790> black

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
fall all the way down into two black

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
fall all the way down into two black
thing<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.420> water<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.770> block<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
thing of water it can be one block but I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
thing of water it can be one block but I
kind<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> black<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.690> what

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
kind of like to black more because what

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.720 
kind of like to black more because what
if<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.739> block<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.309> harder<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
if it's one block then it's harder to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.360 
if it's one block then it's harder to
get<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.149> any<00:00:46.050> way<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> my

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
mine through wait three blocks and then

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.750 
mine through wait three blocks and then
dig<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> nice<00:01:12.270> tunnel<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.040> then<00:01:14.040> wait<00:01:14.580> another

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
dig a nice tunnel and then wait another

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
dig a nice tunnel and then wait another
three<00:01:15.030> black<00:01:15.240> explored<00:01:15.600> torch<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:16.080> dig<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
three black explored torch there dig a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.609 
three black explored torch there dig a
nice<00:01:16.500> tunnel<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:19.259> normally

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
nice tunnel down then I would normally

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.800 
nice tunnel down then I would normally
take<00:01:20.460> another<00:01:20.700> three<00:01:20.970> blocks<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.479> way<00:01:21.540> or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
take another three blocks this way or

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.359 
take another three blocks this way or
four<00:01:21.990> blocks<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.350> guess<00:01:22.500> technically<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:25.369> then

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
four blocks I guess technically and then

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.950 
four blocks I guess technically and then
I<00:01:26.580> would<00:01:26.759> dig<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> tunnel<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.299> basically

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
I would dig a tunnel just basically

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
I would dig a tunnel just basically
straight<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.759> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
straight down now you do have to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.060 
straight down now you do have to
remember<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.240> use<00:01:30.390> torches<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> otherwise

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
remember to use torches it is otherwise

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.280 
remember to use torches it is otherwise
it<00:01:32.220> gets<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:32.640> dark<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.360> most<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.530> so

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
it gets pretty dark and most of these so

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
it gets pretty dark and most of these so
yeah<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> set<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.820> my

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to set these up at y 14 the X and Z

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.030 
to set these up at y 14 the X and Z
don't<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.520> matter<00:01:50.670> at<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.180> whatsoever

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.889 
don't really matter at all whatsoever
so<00:01:53.040> yeah<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.119> reason<00:01:54.240> though<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
so yeah the reason though you want to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.370 
so yeah the reason though you want to
set<00:01:55.049> them<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.409> Y<00:01:55.560> 14<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.840> because<00:01:57.840> lava

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
set them up at Y 14 is because lava

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.670 
set them up at Y 14 is because lava
pools<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.950> spawn<00:01:59.219> lower<00:01:59.610> than<00:02:00.420> Y<00:02:00.780> 14<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.469> y

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
pools will spawn lower than Y 14 and y

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.499 
pools will spawn lower than Y 14 and y
12<00:02:02.040> even<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.670> believe<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.659> Y<00:02:03.990> 14<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> best

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
12 even I believe so Y 14 is the best

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.240 
12 even I believe so Y 14 is the best
place<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.540> finding<00:02:07.079> diamonds<00:02:07.290> because<00:02:07.860> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
place for finding diamonds because you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.490 
place for finding diamonds because you
will<00:02:08.399> spawn<00:02:08.700> above<00:02:09.060> lava<00:02:09.390> pools<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.050> you'll

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
will spawn above lava pools and you'll

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.000 
will spawn above lava pools and you'll
