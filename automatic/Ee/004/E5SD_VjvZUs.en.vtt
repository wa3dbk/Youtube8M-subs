I<00:00:05.480> first<00:00:06.480> heard<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.990> larks<00:00:07.230> ending<00:00:07.529> at<00:00:07.770> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
I first heard the larks ending at the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.080 
I first heard the larks ending at the
Royal<00:00:08.340> College<00:00:08.490> music<00:00:08.849> when<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.090> was<00:00:09.300> 15

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.550 

I<00:00:16.490> like<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.610> meditative<00:00:18.450> aspect<00:00:19.200> of<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I like the meditative aspect of it I

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.050 
I like the meditative aspect of it I
like<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.790> the<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.270> freedom

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.370 

there<00:00:28.060> is<00:00:28.210> I<00:00:28.630> mean<00:00:28.990> there's<00:00:29.110> a<00:00:29.140> kind<00:00:29.260> of

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
there is I mean there's a kind of

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.590 
there is I mean there's a kind of
yearning<00:00:29.560> for<00:00:29.950> something<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:31.360> don't<00:00:31.540> know

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
yearning for something you don't know

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.200 
yearning for something you don't know
what<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.840> is<00:00:31.870> something<00:00:32.620> that's<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.910> feel

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
what it is something that's you feel

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:50.190 
what it is something that's you feel
it's<00:00:34.990> a<00:00:35.080> nostalgia

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.240 

it<00:00:51.200> seemed<00:00:51.380> that<00:00:51.410> an<00:00:51.560> orchestra<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.100> it's

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
it seemed that an orchestra is that it's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.390 
it seemed that an orchestra is that it's
not<00:00:52.520> an<00:00:52.880> instrument<00:00:53.660> in<00:00:54.350> one<00:00:54.650> say<00:00:54.830> it's<00:00:54.950> it's

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
not an instrument in one say it's it's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.170 
not an instrument in one say it's it's
it's<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.880> group<00:00:56.120> of<00:00:56.300> people<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:58.150> they<00:00:59.150> are

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
it's a group of people and they are

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.880 
it's a group of people and they are

musicians<00:01:01.550> what<00:01:02.510> gets<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.900> best<00:01:03.140> out<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.410> it

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
musicians what gets the best out of it

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.450 
musicians what gets the best out of it
is<00:01:04.250> if<00:01:04.280> they<00:01:04.670> feel<00:01:05.000> they<00:01:05.660> can<00:01:05.870> give<00:01:06.650> who<00:01:07.250> they

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
is if they feel they can give who they

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
yet at the same time there has to be a

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.540 
yet at the same time there has to be a
focus<00:01:13.640> or<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.910> vision<00:01:14.540> of<00:01:14.720> what<00:01:15.080> kind<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.920> style

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
is just play with a certain speed of bow

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.420 
is just play with a certain speed of bow
or<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.030> certain<00:01:23.330> color<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.840> then<00:01:24.380> everyone<00:01:25.009> can

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
or a certain color and then everyone can

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.370 
or a certain color and then everyone can
sort<00:01:25.759> of<00:01:25.790> know<00:01:25.970> what<00:01:26.000> what<00:01:26.540> we're<00:01:26.930> aiming<00:01:27.229> for

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
sort of know what what we're aiming for

sort of know what what we're aiming for
you<00:01:28.280> can<00:01:28.400> go<00:01:33.280> or<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.729> be<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.890> different

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
you can go or you can be the different

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
you can go or you can be the different
speed<00:01:37.160> of<00:01:37.369> bow<00:01:40.660> for<00:01:41.660> one<00:01:41.900> when<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:42.259> first<00:01:42.880> saw<00:01:43.880> it

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
speed of bow for one when I first saw it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.570 
speed of bow for one when I first saw it
but<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.300> know<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.509> reminded<00:01:44.990> me<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.550> like<00:01:46.550> a

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
but you know it reminded me of like a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.780 
but you know it reminded me of like a
Roman<00:01:47.770> amphitheatre<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:48.950> walking<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:49.460> and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
Roman amphitheatre just walking in and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.000 
Roman amphitheatre just walking in and
then<00:01:49.940> when<00:01:50.180> we<00:01:50.330> finally<00:01:50.710> started<00:01:51.710> actually

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
then when we finally started actually

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.610 
then when we finally started actually
played<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.400> there<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:53.420> mean<00:01:53.990> first<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.440> all<00:01:54.500> this

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
played in there I mean first of all this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.320 
played in there I mean first of all this
is<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.860> clarity<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.640> can<00:01:55.909> hear<00:01:56.120> everything

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
is the clarity you can hear everything

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.140 
is the clarity you can hear everything
so<00:01:56.479> clearly<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.260> there's<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.159> warmth<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.909> I

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
so clearly and there's a warmth and I

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.000 
so clearly and there's a warmth and I
think<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.450> mixture<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.140> being<00:02:00.470> able<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.620> hear

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
think that mixture of being able to hear

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.289 
think that mixture of being able to hear
be<00:02:01.760> able<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.000> play<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:02.510> quietly<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.260> yet<00:02:03.620> still

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
be able to play so quietly and yet still

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.650 
be able to play so quietly and yet still
it<00:02:05.299> be<00:02:05.570> heard<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:07.400> think<00:02:08.179> it's<00:02:08.269> affected

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
it be heard and I think it's affected

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.120 
it be heard and I think it's affected
the<00:02:08.720> orchestra<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.200> way<00:02:09.290> we<00:02:09.500> play<00:02:09.739> because

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
the orchestra the way we play because

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.640 
the orchestra the way we play because
you<00:02:10.340> know<00:02:10.459> what<00:02:10.850> we<00:02:10.940> get<00:02:11.060> what<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.420> hear<00:02:11.810> can

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
you know what we get what you hear can

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.920 
you know what we get what you hear can
influence<00:02:12.920> what<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.549> play<00:02:13.910> next<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:14.660> it's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
influence what you play next and so it's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.170 
influence what you play next and so it's
like<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.290> circle<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:16.030> imagination<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
like a circle of imagination and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.830 
like a circle of imagination and
receiving<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> lot<00:02:18.140> yeah

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.550 

what<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:23.960> have<00:02:24.140> here<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.010> place<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.000> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
what we have here is a place and a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.760 
what we have here is a place and a
working<00:02:27.560> condition<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.760> we<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:29.060> actually

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
working condition that we can actually

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.620 
working condition that we can actually
explore<00:02:30.770> like<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.940> highest<00:02:32.950> musical

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
explore like the highest musical

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.900 
explore like the highest musical
imagination<00:02:35.630> with<00:02:36.170> great<00:02:36.670> musicians<00:02:37.670> who

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
imagination with great musicians who

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.660 
imagination with great musicians who
lead<00:02:38.360> us<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.780> know<00:02:38.900> great<00:02:39.890> conductance<00:02:40.430> I

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
lead us you know great conductance I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.810 
lead us you know great conductance I
think<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.630> that's<00:02:41.810> really<00:02:42.220> something<00:02:43.220> very

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
think that that's really something very

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.010 
think that that's really something very
very<00:02:43.970> unusual<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> chamber<00:02:46.640> orchestra<00:02:47.020> it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
very unusual in a chamber orchestra it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.110 
very unusual in a chamber orchestra it
everything's<00:02:48.500> much<00:02:48.650> closer<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.730> it's<00:02:49.880> more

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
everything's much closer so it's more
