00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
dreams like that you can just pick them
all<00:01:36.180> I've<00:01:36.659> used<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.049> spot<00:01:37.640> probably

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
all I've used that spot probably

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.749 
all I've used that spot probably
anywhere<00:01:39.540> from<00:01:39.600> five<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.200> ten<00:01:40.590> times<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.250> like

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
anywhere from five to ten times in like

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.120 
anywhere from five to ten times in like
real<00:01:42.180> matches<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.040> definitely<00:01:44.220> useful
