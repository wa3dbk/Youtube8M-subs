00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.040
 this time we are going to take the boxes 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.760
 one step further making them 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.220
 slight modifications that then of some 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.170
 way they will take you out of doing 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.779
 pure little boxes and doing things a little 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.820
 more interesting here I'm going to lower the 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.710
 opacity a little bit of this that was already 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.519
 drawn so that it is only as 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.050
 reference and let's start with this 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.850
 by this cube this box from the side 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.150
 left I'm going to make a modification 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.060
 simple I'm just going to trace the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.790
 centers of the opposite face and its 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.190
 respective face behind you can not see 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.500
 actually but here we start to see the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.910
 importance of drawing faces with 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.570
 everything and its transparency 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.330
 ok I connect the centers and we can leave 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.190
 this time so this form although it seems 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:03.409
 be very simple but look once 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.479
 that we trace the important parts 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 you will see that this form changed a little 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 then we come here we come towards 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.490
 above 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.350
 we trace this part here and I'm going to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.530
 change the size remember that always 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.500
 you must mark the difference very well 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.770
 between the line value of the outside and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.079
 the inside then we mark this 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.330
 and our form has completely changed 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:35.360
 this time we have 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.640
 so a kind of could be a 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.500
 bench lying down I do not know in a way that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.840
 you want to find it totally depends 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.270
 of you then then add a little bit of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.000
 color and we move on to the next one for this 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.950
 figure let's do the process 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.770
 let's say opposite ok I'm going to extend this 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.770
 figure towards this direction or towards this 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.620
 top side and I'll do like 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.720
 following the leaks 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.020
 this measure that I have here I am going to 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.270
 duplicate to the front calculating what to 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.850
 eye although as we saw there is a way 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.110
 a little more accurate to calculate it 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.570
 but right now I do not worry so much 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.510
 that because only because I'm 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.360
 approaching the sizes then here the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.050
 double up here to here 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.340
 here for here since I have this what 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.280
 I'm going to do is look for the center and I do 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.080
 a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.930
 a cross 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.650
 since I have that cross going through that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.670
 center 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.430
 I'm going to draw a line that goes to the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.750
 on the run, too, and with that I already have 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.420
 Obviously then the escape from the sides ok 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.569
 here what I can do is trace the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.110
 same figure that deals in the other that 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.690
 it would be something like this on each side or what 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.239
 I can do inverted if I want it to be 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.920
 the other way around, so a peak 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.750
 instead of having a peak trimmed 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.620
 then we're going to do it the other way around 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.560
 to vary the figure a little 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.409
 to the rectangle on the right side and to this 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.049
 let's do something a little different 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.349
 let's remove a section here from the 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.290
 top part very well then you 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.250
 we remove a section following again 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.230
 the leaks we can take out the center 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.030
 here in the face in front because as 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.190
 I tell you it's such a big face that and if 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.960
 it 's worth it, so do not risk it because 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.330
 it's going to be very obvious if we commit some 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.780
 error that then here I follow the flight 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.580
 back here I follow it towards the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.070
 right that I think I was wrong 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.819
 little then it's not up and where 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.079
 come together I come down 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.189
 next to this part / is half and I'm going 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.400
 to take advantage of it already says that a 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.109
 vertical I'll upload it a little bit more 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.560
 here I will come 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:03.380
 following the leak on this side 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.599
 one of those pieces and now I added a 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.160
 triangle on the top if you already 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.069
 we remove a triangle from it we can 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.630
 look for another triangle to remove or that 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.430
 add then let's add one 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.930
 here in this plane that we created we are going to 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.650
 add one here maybe a little more 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.340
 small not so high where is a 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.720
 little part down here 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.730
 even if the divisions are small 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.700
 you have to notice very well that you are 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:36.080
 following the leak ok then there already 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.180
 the figure was quite modified and 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.580
 I think we can go with the color 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.100
 black to define well all those 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.080
 surfaces 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.340
 for the prism that is down to the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.640
 left that looks like it's flying 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.890
 I'm going to draw a picture in the part of 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.010
 down on your face down and I'm going to 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.810
 connect to the top face once you 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.360
 add the shadows I think it's going to 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.569
 the intention becomes clearer then 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.759
 I'm going to do that, add the colors 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.210
 with some colors and not shadows and 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.990
 lines 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.360
 we continue with this prism that looks like a 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.449
 building but with a very perspective 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.530
 exaggerated and we go back to our technique 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.099
 initial to mark the two centers ok ya 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.289
 that we do this we can mark a 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.560
 vertical line that divides the prism into 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.590
 two parts we can bring it back 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.080
 this must match the line of 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.330
 center that was there perfect and now yes 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.090
 we can start making modifications 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:43.020
 for example if I divide this back to 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.000
 half I bring it to the other side and 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.150
 I divided the part of 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.860
 back I'm going to put a peak or I'm going to 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.930
 do the same technique that I did in the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.199
 first but this time the peak is going to 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.760
 stay down ok the frame of this 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.370
 towards here 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.670
 and then I can make two peaks towards 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.550
 up in the center I'll find it 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.340
 intuitively then here I come 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.000
 upwards then down towards the center 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.270
 I go up again and it came down again I do it in 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.420
 the face in front I climb under the center 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:22.830
 rise again and back down 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:25.560
 frame lines and I do shadows 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.620
 we finished the exercise making a 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.430
 modification to the prism of poses the only 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.220
 that is missing ok and you're good I remember you 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.900
 the intention of this exercise 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.840
 basically you see that starting from 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.070
 very simple figures you can get 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.370
 things a little more elaborate ok in this 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:50.280
 case I will do as a box it 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.500
 I could say ok for 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.510
 to do something different, not because 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.730
 all the pieces have more or less the 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:01.139
 same technique then here the only thing that 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:03.090
 I'm doing is to use guide lines to 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.340
 make a modification in the figure 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.380
 I hope it has been clear what 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.590
 is the technique here that 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:14.040
 basically it 's using centers and using 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.510
 guidelines for not to leave 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.240
 of perspective not that's the most 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:23.060
 important then I see them in the 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.060
 next video and keep drawing
