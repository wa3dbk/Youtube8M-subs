00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 sometimes manufacturers make a tricky move and 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.940
 writes that the drink is made based 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.400
 pure cultures only this is not ether at all 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.010
 in the production of the present labor 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.890
 kefir fungi and from should be indicated 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.600

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.600
 purchase warns 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.660
 this drink is made from milk but 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.790
 for its healing properties, it is much 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.860
 surpasses its progenitor 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.380
 they drink it to prevent a whole bunch 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.220
 disease but all magic properties 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.500
 kefir 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.980
 disappear as soon as it turns into 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.750
 kefir product us the most important thing is that we 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.019
 must understand that kefir is a product 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.030
 100% guaranteed made of 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.500
 milk and 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:04.120
 painted over based on live 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.100
 kefir fungus kefir product is 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.479
 a product that can be like 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.310
 From milk so and can be with adding 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.460
 let's say vegetable fat 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.530
 but this is not the only assumption that 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.750
 kefir has changed its status enough 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.729
 replace kefir fungus dry 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.790
 leaven proper and well 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.630
 many manufacturers of kefir production 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.630
 from real live kefir fungi 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.829
 this is a very expensive production and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.509
 human factor plays very 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.780
 a serious role if god forbid 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:45.060
 error or something else you can ruin both 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.109
 dry yeast and fungus 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.450
 dairy product guaranteed 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.759
 after all, unlike kefir 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.260
 fungi living their lives this 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.810
 dried strains of dairy grandma 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.700
 eventually get a drink to taste 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.760
 qualities are like kefir 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.800
 but in terms of content there are some outcomes. 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.590
 manufacturers do not stop and 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 this is without ferment use thermophilic 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.140
 yeast are those yeasts that are high 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.140
 temperatures don't die accordingly 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.300
 as in our body temperature is 36 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.390
 and 6 in our body, they also do not 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.790
 dies and continues to live and develop 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.310
 and multiply it is dangerous because 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.440
 acidification occurs 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.180
 may result in stone formation 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.400
 gall bladder and various other 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.990
 diseases 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.660
 it would seem one way to cook kefir 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.540
 whole house but the process is complicated 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.490
 so we decided to buy home-made kefir 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.740
 Grandma's cooking in the market 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.709
 he was offered to try buyers 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.390
 the store without comparison on the table is not 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.180
 kefir methods true 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.390
 the respondents don't know by that number he 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.120
 hiding I think kefir at number 2 i 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.459
 real kefir kefir under us vadim this 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.940
 kefir product number one sour 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.810
 but this is generally a great number two 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.750
 sample number 1 is artificial 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.620
 product and only one person 2 dozen 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.880
 the respondents chose the real home 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.250
 it resembles the taste of childhood village 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.290
 sample number one which means that all 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.250
 long forgotten what should be real 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.380
 kefer 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.030
 it should be noted that experts 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.330
 homemade product 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.410
 refer spare if it is not done 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.870
 yourself then you must be very sure of 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.269
 the grandmother with whom you settled 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.250
 regular buying relationships and and 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:46.430
 but remember to buy something 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.580
 buy in a store from a famous 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.580
 manufacturer 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.410
 to understand kefir in front of you or 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.110
 kefir product read the composition 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.030
 any deviation from formula milk plus 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.040
 yeast on kefir fungi 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.460
 says that before you on tee 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.780
 and remember kefir can not be stored for a long time 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:12.220
 ether is usually the most useful in 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.780
 first week of your life and optimal 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.940
 shelf life from one week to two weeks 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.890
 out west and the manufacturer has specified
