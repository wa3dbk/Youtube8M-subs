00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.480
 the first one is march 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.890
 innovation in the 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.400
 and indeed 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:20.570
 replaces this picture as you can see 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.220
 So the the pine against the against 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.710
 pine registration through the crash up 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.130
 that means a silicone must be included 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 knead or knead and silicone on the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.100
 press option and then against it 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.940
 the antagonists in africa gate together 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.970
 bite 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.810
 Peter is clearly visible on the left 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.970
 the green beetle here became the 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.829
 both skis stay against each other 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.260
 fixed as they are also in the article 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.300
 30 may still bite in the article breath 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.199
 check it out 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.510
 possibly the better if needed 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.320
 officially lower more steam the two 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.230
 teams up and scan them for me 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.780
 then to a so-called well knows 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.460
 in my multicar software and have 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.060
 then in connection the possibility this 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.950
 both beetles yes there against each other 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.080
 So register here in the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.620
 middle of the gray beetle is only mine 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.509
 Mandible always busy traffic 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.159
 I have positioned it exactly like that 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.930
 again lower jaw also in the small one 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.720
 window is there I 'm looking for two 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.150
 small reference points and the software 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 match more then you position one 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.320
 They show pine to the identical one 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.570
 put that mostly with upper and 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.759
 lower jaw and therefore I have like 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.009
 in my two articles are pine 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.079
 on again digital in the software and 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.820
 can so against my original 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.820
 upper jaw the bridge construction 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 to construct 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.439
 here you can see the whole now times out 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.899
 so the upper jaw of the reader first 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.950
 antagonist multicard software 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.740
 was selected 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.689
 the gray beetle is my mandible and 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.030
 the priority my went that was it 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.460
 my franc who has scanned separately 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.070
 just for the reason that then 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.710
 have the implants exposed again 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.660
 can leave and the landrat 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.360
 positioning and implant position there 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 also constant 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.840
 So this positioning is not from the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.200
 fat especially here the festival the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.450
 first is really a whole for me 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.520
 great update just for the reason me 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.830
 So see my actual fan I 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.010
 I really have an original pine 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.210
 have in the software I entered 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.370
 can be much nicer the scene fuller 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.210
 anatomically against the goal 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.580
 put up 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.040
 it was now the things he went throughout 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.870
 Missed I did not have that now 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.610
 full aesthetic picture with me on the 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.770
 monitor supports users the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.780
 Possibility to simply add 7 articles to a gate 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.060
 model and here in the exhibition 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.580
 easy to set up the teeth fitting 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.530
 So that's really what I can tell everyone 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.410
 just to heart because it delivers in one 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.930
 to make more and investor first 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.870
 it is much more accurate to take a reading 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.400
 as if it all fits together 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.470
 realize big source of error 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.480
 if it is selected to produce 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.070
 if it is not supplied to the dentist 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.890
 and I have to be sure that 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.990
 he's taking care of me here 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.910
 of course, the possibility clearly 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.680
 better and more precise positioning 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.800
 and that's where I'm at 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.720
 Full of NATO people work absolutely 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.720
 has better mountings
