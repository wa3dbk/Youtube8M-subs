modern<00:02:22.890> computer<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.890> know<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.040> really

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
modern computer and you know you really

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.690 
modern computer and you know you really
don't<00:02:27.240> have<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.510> worry<00:02:27.810> about<00:02:28.020> whether<00:02:28.700> you

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
don't have to worry about whether you

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.920 
don't have to worry about whether you
know<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.200> performs<00:02:32.150> for<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.209> test<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
