video<00:00:17.270> on<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.600> truck<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.050> get<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> code<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:20.340> a

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
video on this truck we get a code for a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.880 
video on this truck we get a code for a
malfunctioning<00:00:22.500> knock<00:00:23.369> sensor<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> we'll

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
malfunctioning knock sensor and so we'll

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.960 
malfunctioning knock sensor and so we'll
show<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.400> went<00:00:26.580> went<00:00:26.730> underneath

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
show you we went went underneath

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849 
show you we went went underneath
investigated<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.869> found<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> wire<00:00:28.619> was

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
investigated and found that the wire was

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.440 
investigated and found that the wire was
broken<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.119> went<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.420> got<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> new

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
broken so we just went out got a new

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.010 
broken so we just went out got a new
connection<00:00:33.450> end<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.820> then<00:00:35.820> spliced<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.840> back

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
connection end and then spliced it back

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
connection end and then spliced it back
in<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> set<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.100> back<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> truck

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
in and set it back up and now the truck

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.119 
in and set it back up and now the truck
runs<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:40.290> no<00:00:40.590> codes<00:00:40.890> flashing<00:00:45.230> ok<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.289> right

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
runs with no codes flashing ok so right

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.360 
runs with no codes flashing ok so right
up<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:49.110> Centaur<00:00:50.070> we'll<00:00:50.250> be

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
up here is the Centaur we'll be

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
up here is the Centaur we'll be
replacing<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> 7/8<00:00:54.770> kind<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
replacing and I have a 7/8 kind of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
replacing and I have a 7/8 kind of
fitting<00:00:56.160> wrench<00:00:57.680> up<00:00:58.699> on<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:01.820> o2<00:01:02.820> sensor<00:01:03.420> ok

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
fitting wrench up on to the o2 sensor ok

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:18.070 
fitting wrench up on to the o2 sensor ok
and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> eat<00:01:04.500> another<00:01:04.739> wrench

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.109 

put<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.259> there<00:01:19.500> give<00:01:20.490> me<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.759> extra<00:01:20.880> leverage

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
put on there give me some extra leverage

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.210 
put on there give me some extra leverage
and<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> exhaust<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.900> hot<00:01:25.229> still<00:01:28.009> does<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and the exhaust is hot still does that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.810 
and the exhaust is hot still does that
will<00:01:29.369> hopefully<00:01:29.610> help<00:01:29.970> me<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:31.380> more

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
will hopefully help me get some more

00:01:31.820 --> 00:02:00.070 
will hopefully help me get some more
help<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> break<00:01:33.210> free

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.290 

from<00:02:01.080> here<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.940> our<00:02:03.060> knock

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
from here we can see this is our knock

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.150 
from here we can see this is our knock
sensor<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> problem<00:02:05.010> right<00:02:05.100> off

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
sensor and you see the problem right off

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.730 
sensor and you see the problem right off
the<00:02:05.369> bat<00:02:05.550> there's<00:02:05.850> no<00:02:05.970> wire<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the bat there's no wire this is the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.180 
the bat there's no wire this is the
insulation<00:02:09.170> pull<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.290> wire<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.530> there's<00:02:11.070> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
insulation pull the wire out there's a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.570 
insulation pull the wire out there's a
wire<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.940> wire<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.120> broken<00:02:13.250> okay<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.310> we'll

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
wire so the wire is broken okay so we'll

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.870 
wire so the wire is broken okay so we'll
just<00:02:14.610> remove<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.350> squeeze<00:02:16.350> here<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.700> both

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
just remove this squeeze here with both

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.740 
just remove this squeeze here with both
fingers<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.690> comes<00:02:21.989> off<00:02:23.420> okay<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.480> we

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
fingers and that comes off okay so we

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.420 
fingers and that comes off okay so we
got<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> new<00:02:25.110> connection<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.160> we're<00:02:26.280> going<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
got a new connection and we're going to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.360 
got a new connection and we're going to
splice<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.020> we've<00:02:28.140> got<00:02:28.320> our<00:02:28.440> wire<00:02:28.650> strip

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
splice it on so we've got our wire strip

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.060 
splice it on so we've got our wire strip
just<00:02:29.580> about<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.880> quarter<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.270> an<00:02:30.360> inch<00:02:30.420> off<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
just about a quarter of an inch off and

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.350 
just about a quarter of an inch off and
set<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.280> into<00:02:32.640> our<00:02:32.670> splice<00:02:35.000> okay<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.090> take

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
set that into our splice okay so take

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
set that into our splice okay so take
our<00:02:37.130> crimping<00:02:38.130> pliers<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.970> put<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> nice<00:02:39.989> crimp

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
our crimping pliers and put a nice crimp

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.130 
our crimping pliers and put a nice crimp
in<00:02:40.640> both<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.910> connector<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.600> well<00:02:42.720> as<00:02:43.049> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
in both the connector as well as the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.300 
in both the connector as well as the
insulation<00:02:43.880> that's<00:02:44.880> nice<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.299> secure<00:02:46.310> okay

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
insulation that's nice and secure okay

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.750 
insulation that's nice and secure okay
so<00:02:47.370> here's<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.790> wire<00:02:48.090> here<00:02:49.340> you've<00:02:50.340> stripped

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
so here's your wire here you've stripped

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.259 
so here's your wire here you've stripped
off<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.560> same<00:02:52.860> thing<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.760> end<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.640> insert

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
off the same thing on the end and insert

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:17.449 
off the same thing on the end and insert
that<00:02:57.330> into<00:02:59.510> our<00:03:00.510> splice

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.920 

okay<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.640> wire<00:03:18.909> insulation<00:03:19.239> actually

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
okay this wire insulation actually

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.309 
okay this wire insulation actually
really<00:03:20.140> shouldn't<00:03:20.530> be<00:03:20.709> wire<00:03:21.220> tied<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.730> there

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
really shouldn't be wire tied on there

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.350 
really shouldn't be wire tied on there
it<00:03:23.319> causes<00:03:23.739> too<00:03:23.890> much<00:03:24.040> stress<00:03:24.549> on<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.030> wire

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
it causes too much stress on this wire

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.660 
it causes too much stress on this wire
and<00:03:25.629> that's<00:03:25.720> why<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.129> broke<00:03:27.129> in<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.400> first

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
and that's why it broke in the first

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.660
