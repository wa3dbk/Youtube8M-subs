00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 would like material that has been adapted and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.340
 developed essentially for the m 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.889
 I mean rather typed type and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.630
 simply because we have 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.940
 chosen because the device on pen exists 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.440
 also within the rabbo society 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.730
 present essentially today on 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.090
 that the cots because necessarily because 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.279
 now mainly at the level of 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.510
 cuma at the level of farmers it remains 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.289
 the telescopic becomes a tool 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 essential 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.060
 so we found this process allowing 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.779
 versatility in the various 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.030
 farms 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.010
 it's still easier to 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.559
 carry only one device that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
 can be dropped on a street hand and then 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 that we can move in 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.350
 different games in different 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.329
 sites as said I read that it's 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.680
 important all that makes the yield 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.000
 of a device like this is the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.879
 driver dexterity as a death of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.399
 told he 'll cut he'll cut up 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.230
 30 cm in diameter 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.180
 so that's for sure that the text inherited from 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 the user she important 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.670
 he insisted that for 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.170
 not working to the maximum of him says 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.869
 go for it is still a small 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.500
 margin only to return to the clamp 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.509
 mechanically so we had the task a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.799
 interface that fits and wear 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.960
 okay then all brands combined 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.820
 yolande everything you want from 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.490
 manitou 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.080
 this device which kate team and you do not 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.020
 holding thoughts and a pincer 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.250
 I would say back and rage to guide the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.930
 not really wood because like you 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.610
 have been able to observe 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.240
 we only have one lady 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.820
 who comes to cut the wood on a 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.800
 capacity I repeat it by 30 cm and that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.960
 pushed by had a strand can then 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.310
 interest interest this segment tons 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.690
 on the soul of a centimeter already wanted 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 what you can crack with a 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.590
 traditional braid with a push 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.600
 of 15 systems 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.790
 you already imagine twenty on 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
 the thickness of one centimeter and there is the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.730
 particularity of this device 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.700
 oklahoma a montage that is very very 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.800
 direct 8 is that on the device you 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.479
 only needed to have one 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.080
 couple and so does not have any complexity of 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.820
 san relics health appliances installed 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.330
 and easy to use because when we 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.640
 knows how to use the wolf says the wearer he 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.100
 has suffered so see 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.130
 the device with the hydraulic inlet 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.150
 did we have a sequence system 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.360
 120 hydraulics at the pliers 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.270
 the pass happens to hold so once 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.400
 that she comes to some pressure 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.519
 this pressure tells us ok we can 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.100
 to go we send the hydraulic on the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.400
 holding claws this claw of 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.860
 forgiveness forgiveness once she's 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.480
 mechanically closed once they 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.540
 mechanically closed at that moment 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.030
 we 'll say ok I 'm safe I can 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.670
 send the hydraulics to the cylinder 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.040
 so we send the hydraulics a level 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.640
 of cylinders and we will see precisely 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.320
 push the blade on the on the on 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.750
 30 cm which is guided inside or 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.130
 of course from the lower jaw to 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.810
 level of development of this product there 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.489
 we still have a request for a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.350
 power supply to power 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.590
 electrical and serves what is all 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.050
 simply add a hydraulic line 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.320
 additional in the drama that we 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.780
 gave a little head and the group 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.040
 inseme pennec 326 voiceover is worried 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.209
 by titeuf 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.560
 when we give a hydraulic pulse 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.989
 on top of a poster or electrical on it 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.900
 we simply have to hydraulics that 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.920
 goes out on the field and so the straw 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.880
 bowing -5 degrees 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.620
 85 cases of next of course why 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.750
 because these devices like 2010 which 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.090
 are intended to be mounted only on 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.459
 telescopic and telescopic cabinda 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.630
 center you left so like that 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.690
 the operator always has a good 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.069
 visibility on his place of cut 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.880
 here I have nothing particular if this 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.940
 is still to say anyway 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.670
 if it's not the same 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.170
 you ride surprising sky then 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.459
 the interest of his the interest of that he is 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.500
 simple as I told you it is 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.060
 able to cut up to 30 centimeters 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.180
 it also means that you can 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.200
 complete art of 15 cm so his weapons of 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.870
 15 cm it is necessary to avoid precisely the 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.940
 efforts or point changes of 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.900
 gravity we're going to have on the tree where the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.490
 boom where the branch we are going to cut 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.979
 just have to avoid that so for 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.590
 to avoid that we have the knife that comes in 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.970
 support on the wood when we closed the 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.010
 clip it remains six inches 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.530
 behind the forceps so for that the 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.450
 knife makes his effort well his 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.250
 work and not created just desert 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:54.110
 while the weight of pandas 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:57.590
 rain on the jaw close the knife 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.210
 will not penetrate the wood here 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.180
 it's totally mechanical that comes out 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.979
 of detention are there to make up for 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.050
 to overcome that so that's also a 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.210
 important argument and that allows when 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.700
 even to value the story even if 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.770
 I totally agree with the 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.229
 Mr. Chamber of Agriculture Township 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.300
 when we love we reverse or other and 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.789
 that we want to leave generated is better the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.560
 still cut 50 or 60 cm higher 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.060
 he will finish the chainsaw properly 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.289
 this is for once 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.690
 the burst it is done that one says oneself 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.030
 shit in front of him what's that so 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.400
 I endorse everything totally what has 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.990
 been told just now 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.380
 that's why not cooper on 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.070
 telescopic ounces to a material that is 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.340
 designed to do a lot 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.560
 especially from the pole the stalls of the stall 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.080
 of fresnes the state of dunk and support of 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.930
 river support all these kinds of 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.460
 things and then I adjust myself in jalles to 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.040
 because I wonder mostly in 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.100
 parks and castles to them or that it's 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.370
 we are tarred parts 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.530
 in sand and all that so ben you have 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.530
 your comments are false especially not bubbled 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.470
 so that's why we tried to 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.890
 put that on telescopic other dead 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.120
 must be careful must not go 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.430
 the telescopic which is 10 meters 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.040
 top but hey you never forget sought 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.450
 a branch said m must stay 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.700
 I'm pretty sure if m six 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.100
 at seven meters it is already well following the 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.440
 branch is seen that the charger must 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.470
 still absorbs everything at all 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.010
 charge 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.670
 all the load then the crutches 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.440
 it's the same thing is a good gear after so 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.840
 the agricultural I guess we can 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.380
 put also but for me will be 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.040
 telescopic agricultural is better 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.000
 have a telescopic 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.590
 tp with skates it's more reassuring 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.560
 that we have branches to his guests as 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.770
 we put it on crutches we go down the 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.450
 branch are kings I saw from him the 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.780
 side of a road provides sidewalks 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:05.870
 on the city of craon we will search on 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.270
 go get the branch to go to 5 6 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.990
 meters high and we go down there is a 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.990
 Used link 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.129
 although
