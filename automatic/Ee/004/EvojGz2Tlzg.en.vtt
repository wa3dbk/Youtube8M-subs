00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.210
 how about youtube today I come with the 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.120
 new lego that I just bought is the 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.320
 transport 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 return by truck transport 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 transport of imperial troops very well 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.169
 this is then quite a father more than 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.579
 nothing for the figures if what they want 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.460
 is to make an army or apologize if 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.270
 what you want is to have a how 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.270
 say it a 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.990
 It is so trooper, this is the right one 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.910
 for example here are four mini figures 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.910
 exactly all the same 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.100
 there it was well focused 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.560
 they are very very parents these figures are 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.350
 Exactly the same thing, I'm going to take the 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.350
 helmet to one of them won 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.449
 what we are going to have here are going to be 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.449
 two 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.460
 angry soldiers 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.409
 Two other soldiers with a serious face 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.140
 Let's see 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.590
 this then, as you will see 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.820
 for the cost it should be quite small 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.310
 ay says 239 pesos in iron palace 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.110
 and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 he has missile launchers here 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.800
 to see the real 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.420
 Well I do not like missile launchers 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.080
 but good and you see that they are 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.759
 missile launchers and it's pretty basic 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.530
 this layman only has the place to 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:02:00.119
 put the 4 mini figures and they are what 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.119
 who wanted to try here forward 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:09.910
 well this in life at real size in 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.490
 this space fit the one figure and those 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.520
 are your cannons and well 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.750
 steele goes 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.690
 Pretty father has 141 pieces and more 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.960
 that nothing I would recommend for the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.180
 figures since the pieces that it brings then 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.050
 they are gray color is nothing out of what 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.680
 normal and well it's pretty basic this 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.790
 lego since what they wanted to do 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.930
 here is not bad but for the cost 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.930
 it's pretty good 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.940
 besides that something very good about this 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.100
 lego is that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:55.250
 the comparison of the previous ones 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:57.500
 Each package of troops includes two 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.840
 soldiers one type and the other two others 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.140
 two soldiers of another type and this one the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.530
 includes all exactly the same so 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.470
 if they want to make an army of 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.010
 stormtroopers this is the ideal ego in 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.690
 well then now yes this would be all 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:21.270
 only the 15 to teach to see is 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.680
 very very basic this lego 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:29.099
 all he has is the detail and in it 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.160
 for the four figures and here I do not know if 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.950
 they can see 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.740
 a space to put a box of 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.550
 supply that in this case is going to have 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.070
 a little bit of ammunition since it almost did not bring 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.960
 extra ammunition of red color as in 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.750
 previous new ones 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.530
 well then 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.790
 this is this would be all times for there 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.150
 times to see the video please 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.710
 comment subscribe and tell me how 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.300
 it seemed and wait for more star videos 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.930
 wars when of the laymen who have just 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.359
 leave soon 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.359
 and well then until the next and greetings
