can<00:01:03.179> I<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.659> around<00:01:03.929> and<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.100> look<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.580> mine

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
can I get around and if you look at mine

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.260 
can I get around and if you look at mine
I<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> down<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.560> bare<00:01:07.770> pan<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:09.030> also

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I got it down to the bare pan and I also

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
I got it down to the bare pan and I also
if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.660> look<00:01:09.810> at<00:01:09.990> some<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.230> my<00:01:10.350> older<00:01:10.620> videos<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
if you look at some of my older videos I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.930 
if you look at some of my older videos I
also<00:01:11.730> have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> wood<00:01:12.390> floor<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.640> lays<00:01:14.640> down

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
also have a wood floor that lays down

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.450 
also have a wood floor that lays down
basically<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.930> grooves<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.250> would

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
basically in these grooves so that would

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.450 
basically in these grooves so that would
bring<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:17.820> level<00:01:18.300> up<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> first

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
bring your level up to there so first

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
bring your level up to there so first
we're<00:01:21.240> gonna<00:01:21.300> do<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> measurement<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
we're gonna do a measurement of the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.400 
we're gonna do a measurement of the
basic<00:01:23.370> how<00:01:23.700> tall<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> pan<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.290> if

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
basic how tall it is from the pan so if

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
basic how tall it is from the pan so if
you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:26.450> I've<00:01:27.450> got<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.230> I've<00:01:28.650> put<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you can see I've got it I've put the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.220 
you can see I've got it I've put the
tape<00:01:29.640> measure<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.780> ceiling

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
tape measure in at the very ceiling

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.990 
tape measure in at the very ceiling
right<00:01:31.410> tucked<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> under<00:01:32.130> where<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.460> fan<00:01:32.790> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
right tucked it under where the fan is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.260 
right tucked it under where the fan is
can<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:33.960> follow<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.410> down<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> where<00:01:36.030> we're<00:01:36.240> at

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can we follow it down and where we're at

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.430 
can we follow it down and where we're at
is<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.010> can<00:01:38.160> read<00:01:38.370> that<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:40.140> is

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
is know if you can read that that is

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.630 
is know if you can read that that is
saying<00:01:40.740> 75<00:01:41.520> inches<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:43.080> that's<00:01:43.590> six<00:01:43.950> foot<00:01:44.220> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
saying 75 inches so that's six foot you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.690 
saying 75 inches so that's six foot you
can<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:45.000> around<00:01:45.300> in<00:01:45.690> this<00:01:46.470> front<00:01:46.800> cap<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
can move around in this front cap so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.230 
can move around in this front cap so
then<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.000> take<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.480> an<00:01:48.720> inch<00:01:49.320> off<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.240> for

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
then you take about an inch off to for

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
then you take about an inch off to for
the<00:01:51.720> shower<00:01:51.960> curtain<00:01:52.470> rod<00:01:52.650> so<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.400> hangs

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the shower curtain rod so that hangs

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.020 
the shower curtain rod so that hangs
down<00:01:54.210> about<00:01:55.110> an<00:01:55.350> inch<00:01:55.610> now<00:01:56.610> when<00:01:56.760> you<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:56.970> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
down about an inch now when you get to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
down about an inch now when you get to
the<00:01:57.210> back<00:01:57.360> section<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.140> I've<00:01:58.350> hooked<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the back section of it I've hooked the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.880 
the back section of it I've hooked the
tape<00:01:58.950> measure<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.550> the<00:02:00.000> light<00:02:00.770> following<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
tape measure to the light following it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.690 
tape measure to the light following it
down<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:04.070> just<00:02:05.070> above<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.670> floor<00:02:05.940> pan<00:02:06.240> and

that's<00:02:08.700> about<00:02:09.119> 70<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> half<00:02:09.780> inches<00:02:10.349> right

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that's about 70 and a half inches right

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.239 
that's about 70 and a half inches right
there<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.749> section<00:02:13.200> where<00:02:13.469> it's

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:14.249 
there so this this section where it's

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:16.670 
there so this this section where it's
raised<00:02:14.579> up<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.909> little<00:02:15.090> bit<00:02:15.269> where<00:02:15.420> you're<00:02:15.599> not

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
raised up a little bit where you're not

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.880 
raised up a little bit where you're not
in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.400> floor<00:02:17.670> pan<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.269> about<00:02:19.200> five<00:02:19.470> foot<00:02:19.620> ten

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
in the floor pan is about five foot ten

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.100 
in the floor pan is about five foot ten
and<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.239> barely<00:02:21.950> clear<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.690> okay<00:02:24.690> now

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and I just barely clear that okay now

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.350 
and I just barely clear that okay now
i've<00:02:25.409> hooked<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.400> tape<00:02:26.640> measure<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
i've hooked the tape measure to the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.050 
i've hooked the tape measure to the
bottom<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> AC<00:02:27.989> unit<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.940> followed<00:02:29.940> that

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
bottom of the AC unit and followed that

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.970 
bottom of the AC unit and followed that
down<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.319> bed

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
down and to the bed

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.089 
down and to the bed
it's<00:02:32.459> 34<00:02:33.120> inches<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.989> just<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.829> share

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
it's 34 inches so just just to share

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.369 
it's 34 inches so just just to share
under<00:02:35.280> three<00:02:36.060> feet<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.690> top<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:37.079> my<00:02:37.200> bed

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
under three feet to the top of my bed

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.520 
under three feet to the top of my bed
from<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.459> that's<00:02:38.610> three<00:02:39.000> feet<00:02:39.299> from<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
from that so that's three feet from the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.920 
from that so that's three feet from the
AC<00:02:40.709> unit<00:02:41.340> down<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> top<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.450> bed<00:02:42.659> and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
AC unit down to the top of the bed and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.050 
AC unit down to the top of the bed and
if<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> bed<00:02:44.069> down<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.640> bottom

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
if you do the bed down to the bottom

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.699 
if you do the bed down to the bottom
it's<00:02:46.640> right<00:02:47.640> about<00:02:47.849> another<00:02:48.120> two<00:02:48.390> feet<00:02:48.709> 26

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
it's right about another two feet 26

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.610 
it's right about another two feet 26
inches<00:02:50.010> or<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.540> it's<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:51.900> close<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.319> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
inches or so it's pretty close to the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.890 
inches or so it's pretty close to the
same<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.220> most<00:02:53.459> class<00:02:53.819> B's<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.420> might<00:02:54.660> differ

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
same on most class B's you might differ

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.589 
same on most class B's you might differ
in<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.290> couple<00:02:55.620> inches<00:02:55.769> here<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.310> there<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:57.299> I

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
in a couple inches here and there but I

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.530 
in a couple inches here and there but I
think<00:02:57.989> this<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.670> relatively<00:02:59.670> standard<00:03:00.299> type

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
think this is a relatively standard type

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.530 
think this is a relatively standard type
of<00:03:00.720> height<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.319> inside<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:02.010> Class<00:03:02.250> B<00:03:02.540> so

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
of height for the inside of a Class B so

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.080 
of height for the inside of a Class B so
now<00:03:03.780> we<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:04.140> how<00:03:04.379> tall<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.819> mean<00:03:05.970> how

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
now we know how tall it is I mean how

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.670 
now we know how tall it is I mean how
tall<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.690> let's<00:03:06.900> see<00:03:07.019> how<00:03:07.140> wide<00:03:07.379> you

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
tall you can be let's see how wide you

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.059 
tall you can be let's see how wide you
can<00:03:07.859> get<00:03:08.569> okay<00:03:09.569> so<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.959> got<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.349> tape<00:03:10.650> touching

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
can get okay so I got the tape touching

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.589 
can get okay so I got the tape touching
the<00:03:11.190> back<00:03:11.400> wall<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.879> is<00:03:12.000> where<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.269> bed<00:03:12.420> area

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
the back wall this is where the bed area

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.740 
the back wall this is where the bed area
is<00:03:12.840> following<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:13.950> across<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:15.299> it's<00:03:15.510> touching

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
is following it across and it's touching

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.780 
is following it across and it's touching
the<00:03:15.959> wall<00:03:16.140> there<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.109> 78<00:03:19.859> inches<00:03:20.310> so

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
the wall there and that is 78 inches so

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.699 
the wall there and that is 78 inches so
that's<00:03:21.030> pretty<00:03:21.269> good<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.510> mean<00:03:21.750> 78<00:03:22.230> inches<00:03:22.530> is

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
that's pretty good I mean 78 inches is

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.220 
that's pretty good I mean 78 inches is
pretty<00:03:22.980> pretty<00:03:23.730> good<00:03:24.000> that's<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.419> six-six<00:03:24.810> I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
pretty pretty good that's like six-six I

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.659 
pretty pretty good that's like six-six I
have<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.440> queen-size<00:03:25.919> bed<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.310> here<00:03:26.489> and

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
have a queen-size bed in here and

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.349 
have a queen-size bed in here and
there's<00:03:27.359> a<00:03:27.450> little<00:03:27.720> bit<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.870> room<00:03:29.239> now<00:03:30.239> we'll

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
there's a little bit of room now we'll

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.339 
there's a little bit of room now we'll
do<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.480> galley<00:03:30.900> area

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
do the galley area

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.789 
do the galley area
I<00:03:31.380> got<00:03:32.010> tape<00:03:32.220> hooked<00:03:32.489> into<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.299> edge<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
I got tape hooked into the edge of the

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.699 
I got tape hooked into the edge of the
other<00:03:35.069> where<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.790> kitchen<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:37.049> stove<00:03:37.349> and

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
other where the kitchen is the stove and

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.599 
other where the kitchen is the stove and
the<00:03:37.769> sink<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.970> running<00:03:39.540> tape<00:03:39.810> across<00:03:40.609> and

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
the sink and running tape across and

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.589 
the sink and running tape across and
then<00:03:41.730> we<00:03:41.879> got<00:03:43.280> 28<00:03:44.280> inches<00:03:44.639> should<00:03:45.060> be<00:03:45.239> ample

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
then we got 28 inches should be ample

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.599 
then we got 28 inches should be ample
for<00:03:45.840> most<00:03:46.019> people<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.919> sense<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.400> show

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
for most people it's in a sense to show

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.360 
for most people it's in a sense to show
off<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.120> storage<00:03:48.599> on<00:03:48.840> mine<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.379> put<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.190> tape

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
off the storage on mine I put the tape

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.159 
off the storage on mine I put the tape
all<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.639> way<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.150> back<00:03:51.329> wall<00:03:51.599> under<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
all the way to the back wall under the

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:57.289 
all the way to the back wall under the
bed<00:03:52.349> and<00:03:54.049> out<00:03:55.049> here<00:03:55.319> I'm<00:03:55.590> over<00:03:55.799> 5<00:03:56.190> feet<00:03:56.459> I'm

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
bed and out here I'm over 5 feet I'm

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.839 
bed and out here I'm over 5 feet I'm
like<00:03:57.569> 66<00:03:58.260> inches<00:03:58.620> from<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:58.980> back<00:03:59.129> feet<00:03:59.489> to

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
like 66 inches from the back feet to

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.000 
like 66 inches from the back feet to
where<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.930> edge<00:04:01.889> of<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.190> bathroom<00:04:02.699> is<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
where the edge of the bathroom is so and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.339 
where the edge of the bathroom is so and
again<00:04:05.760> there's<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.030> lot<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.540> storage<00:04:06.840> on<00:04:07.169> there

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
again there's a lot of storage on there

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.670 
again there's a lot of storage on there
so<00:04:07.650> storage<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.190> important<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.500> that's<00:04:10.500> a

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
so storage is important and that's a
