Matt talk about that I'll turn it over
to<00:00:40.949> you<00:00:41.629> there's<00:00:42.629> there's<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.460> first<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
to you there's there's the first one is

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.310 
to you there's there's the first one is
vision<00:00:45.299> is<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.570> clear<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.170> that's

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
vision is not clear and I think that's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.590 
vision is not clear and I think that's
big<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.589> in<00:00:47.010> most<00:00:47.790> churches<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.299> they're<00:00:48.449> not

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
big in in most churches if they're not

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.680 
big in in most churches if they're not
growing<00:00:48.870> there's<00:00:49.260> probably<00:00:49.650> no<00:00:49.860> vision<00:00:50.690> very

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
growing there's probably no vision very

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.840 
growing there's probably no vision very
very<00:00:52.199> few<00:00:52.440> times<00:00:52.650> do<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:52.949> find<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.370> church<00:00:53.610> with

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
very few times do you find a church with

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.460 
very few times do you find a church with
a<00:00:53.879> real<00:00:54.269> compelling<00:00:54.690> vision<00:00:55.080> and<00:00:55.350> good

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
a real compelling vision and good

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.930 
a real compelling vision and good
leadership<00:00:55.769> on<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.190> vision<00:00:56.400> that<00:00:56.549> isn't

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
leadership on that vision that isn't

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.969 
leadership on that vision that isn't
growing<00:00:57.269> or<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.470> good<00:00:58.619> type<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979

going<00:01:48.359> to<00:01:48.420> keep<00:01:48.539> yourself<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.530> nights

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
going to keep yourself on the nights

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.789 
going to keep yourself on the nights
over<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.069> one<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:52.590> ties

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
over that one and then that I think ties

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
over that one and then that I think ties
into<00:01:53.069> number<00:01:53.429> four<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.149> his<00:01:54.390> list<00:01:54.630> you'll<00:01:54.929> see

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
into number four on his list you'll see

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
into number four on his list you'll see
if<00:01:55.200> he<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> look<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> link<00:01:56.249> down<00:01:56.490> below

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
if he if you look at the link down below

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.109 
if he if you look at the link down below
it's<00:01:57.390> called<00:01:57.899> manufacturing<00:01:58.200> energy<00:01:59.069> and<00:01:59.999> he

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
it's called manufacturing energy and he

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090 
it's called manufacturing energy and he
just<00:02:00.329> talks<00:02:00.509> about<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.439> program<00:02:01.889> in<00:02:02.069> your

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
just talks about if a program in your

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.459 
just talks about if a program in your
church<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> dead<00:02:02.999> there<00:02:03.990> needs<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.319> be<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
church is dead there needs to be a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.020 
church is dead there needs to be a
funeral<00:02:04.920> people<00:02:05.100> need<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> move<00:02:05.609> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
funeral people need to move on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
funeral people need to move on
and<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> lot<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.749> churches<00:02:06.929> just<00:02:07.289> are

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and I think a lot of churches just are

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.120 
and I think a lot of churches just are
so<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:08.880> over<00:02:09.390> programmed<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.110> there's<00:02:10.740> so

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
so so over programmed and there's so

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.009 
so so over programmed and there's so
much<00:02:11.340> energy<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.909> they're<00:02:12.209> manufacturing

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
much energy that they're manufacturing

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.449 
much energy that they're manufacturing
for<00:02:13.200> these<00:02:13.319> programs<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.890> are<00:02:14.010> really<00:02:14.220> no

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
for these programs that are really no

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.630 
for these programs that are really no
longer<00:02:14.640> doing<00:02:15.180> what<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.510> were<00:02:16.640> envisioned

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
longer doing what they were envisioned

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.399 
longer doing what they were envisioned
when<00:02:17.819> they<00:02:17.970> were<00:02:18.120> started<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.140> do<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:20.269> think<00:02:21.409> it

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
when they were started to do I think it

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.140 
when they were started to do I think it
drains<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.769> life<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.370> lot<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.670> lot<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
drains the life out of a lot of lot of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.089 
drains the life out of a lot of lot of
things<00:02:24.330> yeah<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.530> line<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.950> he

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
things yeah I think the line that he

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.890 
things yeah I think the line that he
that<00:02:26.370> he<00:02:26.430> uses<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.450> says<00:02:27.599> it<00:02:27.629> all

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that he uses and that just says it all

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.930 
that he uses and that just says it all
you<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:28.170> quit<00:02:28.650> trying<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.069> fire<00:02:29.370> people<00:02:29.610> up

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
you know quit trying to fire people up

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.880 
you know quit trying to fire people up
over<00:02:30.269> events<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.959> would<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.290> attend<00:02:31.769> if

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
over events that you would not attend if

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.850 
over events that you would not attend if
you<00:02:32.040> were<00:02:32.129> not<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.370> staff<00:02:32.819> yeah<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.590> just

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
just just let that one soak in right

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.429 
just just let that one soak in right
there<00:02:37.799> because<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.189> think<00:02:38.370> that's<00:02:39.110> that's<00:02:40.110> huge

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439

want to be at I think for me the passion
is<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.840> number<00:03:10.170> three<00:03:10.409> passion<00:03:10.890> less

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870
