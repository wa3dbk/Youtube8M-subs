but I'm using this for my living room so
it's<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.480> quiet<00:02:59.959> gaming<00:03:00.739> setup<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.850> to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
it's just a quiet gaming setup and to

it's just a quiet gaming setup and to
watch<00:03:02.989> movies<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:04.570> also<00:03:05.570> stuff<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:07.489> is

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
watch movies and also stuff in this is

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.280 
watch movies and also stuff in this is
the<00:03:07.880> noise<00:03:08.030> at<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> lowest<00:03:08.840> fan<00:03:09.020> speed

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
the noise at the lowest fan speed

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:23.110 
the noise at the lowest fan speed
setting<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.190> let's<00:03:10.670> have<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> listen

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.250 

not<00:03:23.720> seeing<00:03:23.989> that<00:03:24.170> much<00:03:24.849> let's<00:03:26.049> crank<00:03:27.049> it<00:03:27.200> up

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
not seeing that much let's crank it up

00:03:27.260 --> 00:04:01.010 
not seeing that much let's crank it up
to<00:03:27.549> maximum<00:03:28.549> volume

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.710 

yeah<00:04:02.020> now<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.320> can<00:04:02.590> hear<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.700> that's<00:04:04.210> the

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
yeah now you can hear it so that's the
