00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.109 
problem we wearing these jokers
that<00:01:24.049> video<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.770> shirt<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.220> slim<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.880> fits

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
that video the shirt is slim and it fits

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.880 
that video the shirt is slim and it fits
really<00:01:26.360> especially<00:01:27.229> if<00:01:27.500> you've<00:01:27.619> got<00:01:27.649> your

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
really especially if you've got your

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.160 
really especially if you've got your
torso<00:01:28.189> like<00:01:28.430> me<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.880> helps<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.329> serve<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.930> well

torso like me it helps to serve you well

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.109 
torso like me it helps to serve you well
because<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.619> elongates<00:01:30.770> your<00:01:31.220> torso<00:01:31.280> they

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
because it elongates your torso they

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.679

coalitional is or if you're running away

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.730 
coalitional is or if you're running away
from<00:02:20.320> cops

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
from cops

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.010 
from cops
well<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.370> guess<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.910> could<00:02:22.270> these<00:02:22.900> are

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
well I guess you could these are

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.200 
well I guess you could these are
daughters<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.740> they're<00:02:23.920> stretchy<00:02:24.490> which<00:02:25.090> is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
daughters so they're stretchy which is

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.449 
daughters so they're stretchy which is
perfect<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.570> American<00:02:25.990> cops<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.709> wouldn't

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
perfect for American cops but I wouldn't

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.220 
perfect for American cops but I wouldn't
run<00:02:27.580> away<00:02:27.640> from<00:02:27.850> those<00:02:28.000> don't<00:02:28.780> wanna<00:02:28.930> don't

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
run away from those don't wanna don't

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.260 
run away from those don't wanna don't
want<00:02:29.440> my<00:02:29.560> thing<00:02:29.709> cops<00:02:29.970> don't<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.090> caught<00:02:31.240> by

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
want my thing cops don't get caught by

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.840 
want my thing cops don't get caught by
cops<00:02:31.600> Oh<00:02:31.990> take<00:02:32.800> me<00:02:32.920> there<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.160> call<00:02:33.580> zero

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
cops Oh take me there that call zero

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.880 
cops Oh take me there that call zero
anywhere<00:02:34.090> from<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.330> best<00:02:34.480> weights<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.650> this

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
anywhere from the best weights like this

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.340 
anywhere from the best weights like this
so<00:02:36.670> pretty<00:02:36.760> much<00:02:37.000> nothing<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.660> wearable<00:02:38.170> for

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
so pretty much nothing is wearable for

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.220 
so pretty much nothing is wearable for
everyday<00:02:38.890> wear
