00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.810
 hello how about my name is lloyd 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.900
 celluloid and nobody should be recommended 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.000
 what I believe that I already have a new 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.210
 favorite movie 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.050
 that's how it's done side almodóvar scorsese 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.620
 liz gilbert this movie is about two 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.650
 not three but eight very sensitive issues 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.410
 important that's when they've seen that 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.500
 another movie is about more than one or two of 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.470
 these issues however the pulqueria 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.430
 touches everyone in 130 minutes is a 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.220
 wonder 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.380
 it's so complex that for the first time 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.660
 I will have to divide this criticism in two 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.660
 parts let's start with the first 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.830
 he is a merolico who sells medicines 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 miraculous makes impossible promises of 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.450
 believe the election santacruz comes 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.149
 when the famous cancer 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.539
 this elixir is infallible against the 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.659
 impotence today to you but for this 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.869
 public there are no impossible said another by 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.869
 here 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.930
 I am going to tell the truth 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.070
 and that elixir does not cure anyone of anything 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.020
 shortly after it arrives at the pulquería where 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.100
 the ideal market abounds for its 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.860
 business 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.280
 perhaps he will pay for his lies and for the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.230
 damage caused to their supposed patients 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.230
 the answer is that you never know 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:56.260
 yes so you say they are manu 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.260
 or no no no no it is an open end 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.690
 he is the skinny me and she is the corcholata 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.209
 it accumulates alcohol and accumulates faults 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.209
 of transit but of respect 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.570
 good 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.620
 the less legal side is soon discovered 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.620
 of this character 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.830
 how skinny is my father no longer 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.350
 you are burning with the good society 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.610
 municipal president full- page 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.950
 of the average 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.300
 and who no more when they join you 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.160
 ministers accompany the oscar h nothing 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.319
 will get the support to go up in the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.319
 police force and achieve their dreams 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.330
 but dressed as a policeman is an unhappy 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.510
 next fear 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.370
 the conflict of the movie starts with 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.370
 this character the ayate is 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.820
 because it improves the romareda 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.820
 I give it an elixir 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.480
 and let's concentrate our drawer 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.480
 nacho problems 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:43.160
 well more like seven or eight 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.160
 madras conflicts with whoever 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.360
 of destination yes that is good for the most 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.170
 for the most for the mothers that then 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.910
 we put 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.910
 we would never tell ourselves to see 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.730
 and a lot 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.980
 Grandpa Kiko is chronically ill 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.319
 and his loving grandchildren 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.140
 chavela and machito do everything possible 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.540
 to keep it alive 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.329
 chavela because macho wants to be 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.000
 boxer there's manito again thinking about 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.450
 the box where you are going so perfumed 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.810
 I'm going to see my girlfriend and you're going to win 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.930
 no no no no try to return from boxer 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.870
 we never know his girlfriend either but 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.570
 It's good to know that both work a lot 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.850
 so that the grandfather continues to live but he 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.490
 does not agree the xerecista says 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.540
 little garlitos I do not think that because we are that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.890
 all fucked up bad faith between the wounded in 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.700
 the dying missile piloted what 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.700
 I'm going to leave 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.400
 the toad owner of the pulquería wants 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:08.780
 dance the mambo horizontal with chavela 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.389
 sorry it hits me and as I said 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.789
 know it in the biblical sense but 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.889
 she keeps him at a distance I say it for 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.900
 your practical that raised and educated you with 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.630
 great sacrifices and that is being 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.630
 dying and you're going to let him die for 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.780
 walk tight one day the very 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.940
 miserable day in this hoax and 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.520
 I need to take the medicines to Dad 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.560
 kiko looks 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.870
 what do you think if to make amends 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.050
 with you from the purchase and took them to 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.139
 your house 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:44.650
 is that you know I want to be your friend 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.650
 and as you do not know do not fall for the other 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.539
 here are the medicines but this is 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:56.180
 just the beginning sure your plan is 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.180
 gradually gain their confidence 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:02.060
 you will not deny that he tries to convince you with 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.060
 good reasons 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.830
 because this always happens to me 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.360
 well no way do we continue in this 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.050
 tested let's take a break 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.409
 for more of the best of the worst of cinema 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.409
 Mexican
