00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.110
 hello you love today we tinker times 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.619
 a fragrance mixes 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:26.210
 Let 's take a orange some 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:29.090
 cloves to place small 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.220
 cookie cutters and what do we need 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:41.240
 otherwise maybe a felt marker on 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:47.060
 definitely Qatar and off you go as 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.890
 Of course, the first one has to be orange 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.490
 to be selected you look like 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.300
 she stands best 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:59.860
 Okay, so I cut here now 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.860
 top off a lid 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:17.490
 and would the industry now from so so 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.650
 is a fraction of the the well 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.480
 rauskriegt goes with a knife 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:29.100
 Carefully pure argues now 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:31.490
 not through and cuts once left 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490
 rum 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.479
 then the oranges are very easy 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.479
 choose 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.080
 so and so on continue until the orange 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.080
 whole house is filled 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.760
 now that the orange is selected 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.780
 Can you clove 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.629
 so easy up where once left 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:43.260
 change depending on how much you put in 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.620
 want to stick close or with 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.390
 further distance that is actually 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.920
 left to each one 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.920
 There you can run your imagination free 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 give 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.680
 if the next to not right 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.940
 You can also go in with 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.940
 Imagine the holes in a toothpick 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.409
 that looks pretty nice 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.370
 Now that's a really nice one 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.760
 tealight is still possible with small ones 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.760
 ramekins 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.120
 punch holes I'll do it 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:41.200
 So I lie down the forms 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:45.160
 and we draw the culture 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.930
 with a pen and cuts that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.930
 whole then with a cutter knife 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.400
 I have a very sharp scalpel here 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.110
 that is also excellent who 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.580
 No paypal can of course have one 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.580
 take the normal cutter 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.590
 important is just careful cutting 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.130
 That's our heart shape 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.319
 and now 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.950
 I'll show you another star 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.950
 when the formal ones are cut out 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:21.550
 then our tealight is already 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.770
 finished and so sees the finished 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:30.800
 wind light out if you are beautiful in the dark 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:34.970
 burns through the orange peel 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:39.710
 beautiful the light and also by the 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.720
 recess after a short time already if 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.220
 the heat reaches the cloves 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.070
 a great smell flows from the 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.290
 ramp out I think that's a nice one 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.660
 Bastelanleitung just tried it out
