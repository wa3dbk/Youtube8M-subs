00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.020 
pouring aquarium water and get them used
to<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:45.810> water<00:01:45.990> parameters<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.030> I'm

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to you know your water parameters so I'm

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.490 
to you know your water parameters so I'm
gonna<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.540> these<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.020> fish<00:01:49.259> because

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
gonna do these with this fish because

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.780 
gonna do these with this fish because
the<00:01:49.619> water<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.979> they're<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.310> seemed<00:01:50.640> pretty

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the water that they're in seemed pretty

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
the water that they're in seemed pretty
cold<00:01:51.090> already<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.200> feels<00:01:52.439> about

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
cold already so it actually feels about

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.039 
cold already so it actually feels about
the<00:01:52.979> same<00:01:53.159> temperature<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.880> tank<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.360> they

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the same temperature as my tank so they

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.450 
the same temperature as my tank so they
shouldn't<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:55.680> big<00:01:55.890> transition

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
shouldn't have a really big transition

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.649 
shouldn't have a really big transition
but<00:01:56.729> I'm<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> uh<00:01:59.180> I'm<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.299> let<00:02:00.390> them

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
but I'm going to uh I'm gonna let them

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.020 
but I'm going to uh I'm gonna let them
