should check out stop Oz's channel to
figure<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> URL<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
figure out what that URL is and you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.759 
figure out what that URL is and you
probably<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> ask<00:01:03.899> him<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.290> he's<00:01:04.500> getting

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
probably want to ask him if he's getting

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
probably want to ask him if he's getting
any<00:01:04.890> money<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.790> first<00:01:05.939> thought<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
any money from it so my first thought is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
any money from it so my first thought is
it<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.260> money<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.590> want

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
it you don't really want money you want

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.350 
it you don't really want money you want
the<00:01:07.920> things<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.280> money<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.909> which<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the things that money can get which is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
the things that money can get which is
kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> obvious<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.530> sort<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> weird

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
kind of obvious but it's sort of a weird

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
kind of obvious but it's sort of a weird
concept<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
concept so what you can do is if you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.640 
concept so what you can do is if you
have<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> friend<00:01:12.840> who<00:01:12.990> has<00:01:13.080> those<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
have a friend who has those things you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.980 
have a friend who has those things you
just<00:01:13.729> get<00:01:14.729> adopted<00:01:15.210> by<00:01:15.330> his<00:01:15.540> family<00:01:15.900> or

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
just get adopted by his family or

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.210 
just get adopted by his family or
