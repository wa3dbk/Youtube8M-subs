00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to make the conversion there's a couple

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.120 
to make the conversion there's a couple
of<00:00:31.679> used<00:00:31.890> items<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.399> here<00:00:32.669> reused<00:00:33.210> items<00:00:34.130> and

custom straps made and I'm referring to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.139 
custom straps made and I'm referring to
the<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.219> call<00:00:44.370> riser<00:00:44.610> straps<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the what they call riser straps and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.979 
the what they call riser straps and
nylon<00:00:45.420> riser<00:00:45.629> straps<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
nylon riser straps the this is going to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.010 
nylon riser straps the this is going to
be<00:00:52.050> flown<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:54.829> ASAP<00:00:55.829> Thunderbolt<00:00:57.020> 280

square<00:00:58.170> foot<00:00:58.940> which<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.270> believe<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> about<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
square foot which I believe is about a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.100 
square foot which I believe is about a
26<00:01:01.680> meter<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> conversion<00:01:03.110> but

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
26 meter if you do the conversion but

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
26 meter if you do the conversion but
that's<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.379> elliptical<00:01:04.830> wing<00:01:05.299> made<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that's an elliptical wing made for a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
that's an elliptical wing made for a
powered<00:01:06.810> parachute<00:01:09.830> one<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> first

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
powered parachute one of the first

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.929 
powered parachute one of the first
changes<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:13.100> power<00:01:14.100> parachutes<00:01:14.520> I've<00:01:14.670> steered

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
changes is power parachutes I've steered

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.620 
changes is power parachutes I've steered
with<00:01:15.299> rudder<00:01:15.900> bars<00:01:17.210> that's<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> see

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
with rudder bars that's what you see

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.039 
with rudder bars that's what you see
here

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.359 

show<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:27.040> mechanism<00:01:28.040> it's<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.190> very

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
show you the mechanism it's a very

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.430 
show you the mechanism it's a very
bright<00:01:28.580> day<00:01:28.820> out<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.360> Michigan<00:01:29.840> about<00:01:29.930> 22

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
bright day out in Michigan about 22

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.240 
bright day out in Michigan about 22
degrees<00:01:30.560> no<00:01:31.130> wind<00:01:31.400> quite<00:01:31.760> nice<00:01:31.909> actually

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
degrees no wind quite nice actually

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.790 
degrees no wind quite nice actually
here's<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.400> Rutter<00:01:34.580> bar<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.119> see<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.800> the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
here's the Rutter bar and see that the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.390 
here's the Rutter bar and see that the
motion<00:01:37.159> back<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.340> forth<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.000> stops<00:01:39.400> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
motion back and forth and it stops the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.790 
motion back and forth and it stops the
Rutter<00:01:40.640> bar<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.030> mounted<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.810> front<00:01:42.500> wheel

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
Rutter bar is mounted to the front wheel

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.460 
Rutter bar is mounted to the front wheel
so<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.399> slides<00:01:43.869> fore-and-aft<00:01:44.869> about<00:01:45.200> 12

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
so it slides fore-and-aft about 12

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.850 
so it slides fore-and-aft about 12
inches<00:01:46.930> there<00:01:47.930> Rutter<00:01:48.110> bars<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.649> front

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
inches there Rutter bars and the front

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:58.169 
inches there Rutter bars and the front
wheel<00:01:50.140> also<00:01:51.140> go<00:01:51.860> around<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.100> other<00:01:52.159> side<00:01:52.250> here

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.200 

this<00:01:59.179> is<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.600> steering<00:02:00.259> mechanism<00:02:01.210> selected

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
this is the steering mechanism selected

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.410 
this is the steering mechanism selected
that<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.170> built<00:02:04.360> up<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.600> down<00:02:06.940> set<00:02:07.940> lacks<00:02:08.209> in

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
that I built up and down set lacks in

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.999 
that I built up and down set lacks in
the<00:02:08.509> middle<00:02:08.750> that's<00:02:08.899> straightforward<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.739> if

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
the middle that's straightforward so if

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.160 
the middle that's straightforward so if
you<00:02:10.130> land<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.700> don't<00:02:10.940> wish<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.019> any

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
you land and don't wish you do any

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.020 
you land and don't wish you do any
steering<00:02:12.470> they'll<00:02:13.310> basically<00:02:13.459> go<00:02:13.730> straight

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
steering they'll basically go straight

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.190 
steering they'll basically go straight
down<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.330> runway<00:02:15.070> probably<00:02:16.070> will<00:02:17.019> also<00:02:18.019> work

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
down the runway probably will also work

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:28.150 
down the runway probably will also work
for<00:02:18.260> most<00:02:19.100> launches<00:02:26.769> something<00:02:27.769> else<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:27.980> came

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
for most launches something else I came

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.530 
for most launches something else I came
up<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.489> for<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> throttle<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.120> throttle

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
up with for the throttle is the throttle

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.170 
up with for the throttle is the throttle
here<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.930> got<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.700> adjustable<00:02:34.700> resistance

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
here it's got a adjustable resistance

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.140 
here it's got a adjustable resistance
built-in<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.810> can<00:02:36.049> set<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.530> forget<00:02:36.620> it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
built-in so you can set it and forget it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.000 
built-in so you can set it and forget it
Killswitch<00:02:38.380> here<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:41.810> adjustable<00:02:42.140> in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
Killswitch here this is adjustable in

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.120 
Killswitch here this is adjustable in

down here I have this is where the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.240 
down here I have this is where the
steering<00:03:16.700> foot<00:03:17.209> certain<00:03:17.450> rings<00:03:17.690> were<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:19.190> I

steering foot certain rings were but I

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.920 
steering foot certain rings were but I
just<00:03:19.430> put<00:03:19.610> on<00:03:19.730> some<00:03:19.970> good<00:03:20.209> ball<00:03:20.690> bearing

from<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.160> wing<00:03:25.819> down<00:03:26.090> through<00:03:26.330> here<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.370> to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
from the wing down through here and to

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:38.220 
from the wing down through here and to
the<00:03:28.459> rudder<00:03:28.610> bars<00:03:35.200> here<00:03:36.200> kind<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.069> show<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
the rudder bars here kind of show the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.860 
the rudder bars here kind of show the
spreader<00:03:39.230> bar<00:03:39.440> with<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:41.590> ASEP<00:03:42.790> ASAP

thunderbolt<00:03:44.870> series<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.400> true<00:03:46.549> of

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
thunderbolt series and this is true of

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.360 
thunderbolt series and this is true of
most<00:03:46.790> PPC<00:03:47.510> wings<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.709> they<00:03:48.860> need<00:03:49.040> about<00:03:49.160> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
most PPC wings is that they need about a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.839 
most PPC wings is that they need about a
60<00:03:49.819> inch<00:03:49.849> spreader<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.220> had<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.730> add

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
60 inch spreader and so I had to add

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.569 
60 inch spreader and so I had to add
this<00:03:53.060> piece<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.540> top<00:03:54.099> also<00:03:55.099> I<00:03:55.280> had<00:03:55.549> to

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
this piece to the top also I had to

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.900 
this piece to the top also I had to
raise<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:57.640> chicken<00:03:58.640> bars<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:01.819> can

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
raise the chicken bars and so you can

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.569 
raise the chicken bars and so you can
see<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.840> can<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:07.250> design

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
see the you can see the the design

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.059 
see the you can see the the design
change<00:04:07.879> here<00:04:08.269> went<00:04:09.079> up<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.940> then<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.239> added<00:04:12.069> the

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
change here went up and then I added the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.740 
change here went up and then I added the
spreader<00:04:13.400> bar<00:04:13.639> on<00:04:13.760> top<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.120> spreader<00:04:14.359> bar<00:04:14.540> is
