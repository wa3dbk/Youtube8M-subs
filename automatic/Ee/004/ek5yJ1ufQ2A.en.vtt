 [Music] 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello I'm stÃ©phane for how 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.370
 picture someone like today you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.820
 talk about the important accessories for the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.949
 amateur photographer or not these are the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.400
 soft triggers and the trigger 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.680
 flexible 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 kesa course and good when you have some 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
 shots to do long poses 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.150
 take pictures either from 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.060
 timelapse be having all the time the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.000
 same framing without moving either if you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.949
 have to do night shots with a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 foot as here the camera is placed on 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.410
 my tripod if you have pictures of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.390
 fireworks for example so for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.399
 avoid from grabbing the device is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.470
 to support even if he is on the foot you 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.790
 can still risk to move so 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.190
 we have an accessory that is very practical 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.360
 called the soft trigger 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 then the soft trigger during a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.260
 peculiarity is that there is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.200
 cannon material so here is a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.199
 flexible brand trigger 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.240
 cannon we will adapt it on the side we 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.950
 remove the small rubber hatch and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.530
 we have a crisis really adapted to this 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.909
 model so I just clip me hop 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.240
 this is my soft trigger device 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.590
 eclipsed to my device and there I have my 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 button to trigger 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.110
 so if I press on it you see the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.140
 photo is taken I can also when I 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.780
 do the goal break or bulbs mode 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.520
 up and I block like this the device 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 he'll stay open and I can firmly 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 the device if I'm resting so that's it 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.900
 what's the trigger for 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 really flexible to be able to shoot without 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.790
 to move the same thing that's very 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.500
 convenient 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.390
 on the other hand trigger systems 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.360
 we will see different models 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.950
 syndicate the basic calonne auction you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 will have exactly the same models for 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.439
 nikon depending on your sony hardware 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.780
 olympus pentax according to brands 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.430
 that you use it I encourage you 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
 you return to your dealer 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.290
 favorite and ask him for accessories 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
 adapted to your equipment 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.619
 because that will not affect all 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.420
 other even rank a soft trigger 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.709
 kahn will not necessarily go on others 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.880
 canon cases you really have to do 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.470
 attention to the claw 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.680
 this is where you have to be vigilant 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.500
 other flexible trigger it exists 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.450
 you have another trigger system 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.530
 flexible still cannon much more 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.140
 sophisticated since it is digital 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.660
 so he plugs in the same place 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.920
 that's what we will have 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.690
 he will power must be able to control the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.410
 time with that will serve as an interval to 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.690
 m it'll be able to serve for 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.920
 trigger if I want to make a photo 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.150
 in an hour for example I can the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.910
 program and for him to make a photo 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.340
 in an hour if I want to do for them 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.450
 time lapse make a photo every 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.230
 ten seconds every five seconds 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.090
 every second 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.730
 I want the program and a fram and 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.010
 time lapse photos without problems and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.660
 lots of other things so that's it 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.880
 is really part of the material too 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.459
 very interesting very important to have 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.660
 if we want to make the photo ja in the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.489
 monks a little more expert than we are going 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.519
 to please and landscape or that kind 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.579
 of things that's branded material 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.370
 cannon but you also have less 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.950
 expensive hardware with two brands 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.959
 generics that are going to be a lot less 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.030
 expensive it's exactly the same 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.579
 still a few differences 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.989
 this is where we will be limited in term 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.480
 number of shots there I go 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.000
 not be able to go beyond 399 taken from 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.269
 view so if I want to make a thousand photos 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.579
 I will have to be present 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.579
 arriving to deliver it from 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.370
 that my 399th picture and done so here it is 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.130
 is there is a little bit limited compared to 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.040
 branded material but it remains very 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.760
 effective still we will see too 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.200
 in terms of trigger it's going to be 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.440
 remote shutter it's going to be very 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.510
 practice you have a small model 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.530
 Always barrel mark how they 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.720
 listen 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.000
 I bought them worth less than 10 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.390
 euros and that it can trigger at 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.120
 distance 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.819
 but you have to be in the act 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.110
 of the device it is for example if you 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.209
 did want to do group photos 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.919
 is present on the photo that's 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.690
 the ideal because you are in the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.459
 tail of the camera you have that 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.870
 in front you trigger a way 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.389
 discreet and it works very well 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.150
 so this little model so you have 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:34.370
 just to put yourself at your level 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:38.160
 device in remote mode 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:44.490
 that's what is done and you put in 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.020
 face here I can remotely triggered 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.380
 however, it is very limited in terms of 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.150
 distance 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.850
 it's material that does not cost 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.680
 dear who is very practical but who is going 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.330
 to be very limited in terms of distance 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.130
 after we have material that will be more 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.380
 effective in terms of distance we will 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.460
 to be able to take pictures one way 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.440
 more effective I will show you 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.130
 what is this a system of 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.380
 remote shutter on a device 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.760
 photo reflex your reflexes or no 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.050
 anyway I think it's going to be able 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.060
 operate on different types like 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.700
 bridge where hybrids just have to have 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.550
 a hoof so here you see here I'm going 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.010
 get on the device judge she 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:29.580
 locks on the flash shoe and 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:34.220
 parisian collector here I come to me m I 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.220
 I plugged into the device 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:50.030
 and I have a small order here so 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.460
 equipped with an antenna and I will be able to 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.139
 trigger the device and there you see 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.180
 it's really there it's a very 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.979
 very effective that's what I use 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.240
 most of the time I have a foot for 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.070
 to shoot high and 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.199
 my device will go up with what he has 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.449
 more than 4 meters fifty in height and 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.639
 I use this remote that 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.500
 works perfectly 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.610
 that's in terms of remote controls 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.190
 this type of material is very effective 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.740
 you will obviously find links 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.580
 to this material if you want it 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.229
 without problem on the article on 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.460
 the blog page you will find some 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.669
 links to all these products 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.260
 and if you have comments from 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.600
 questions do not hesitate use the 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.210
 form at the bottom of this page is managed 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.770
 during a peak 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.110
 thank you for your attention was very 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:48.509
 soon
