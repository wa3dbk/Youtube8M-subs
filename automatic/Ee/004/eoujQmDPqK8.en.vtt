for a long time asking me to make some
more<00:00:04.200> sign<00:00:04.410> videos<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:06.150> had<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.509> because<00:00:06.750> I

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
more sign videos and I had it because I

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.770 
more sign videos and I had it because I
was<00:00:06.960> kind<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.649> ideas<00:00:08.030> too<00:00:09.030> lazy<00:00:09.269> kind

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
was kind of out of ideas too lazy kind

was kind of out of ideas too lazy kind
of<00:00:09.840> out<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> idea<00:00:10.290> sirens<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.190> no<00:00:11.639> money

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
of out of the idea sirens and no money

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.250 
of out of the idea sirens and no money
but<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.490> kind<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.480> another<00:00:15.750> project<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
but I kind of have another project to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.990 
but I kind of have another project to
show<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.650> my<00:00:16.800> siren<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.369> here's<00:00:17.820> another

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
show you with my siren so here's another

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.769 
show you with my siren so here's another
side<00:00:18.240> video<00:00:18.539> um<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:20.029> was<00:00:21.029> reading<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> sign

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
side video um I was reading the sign

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.679 
side video um I was reading the sign
board<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.289> other<00:00:22.380> day<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.949> uh<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.570> don't<00:00:24.570> know

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
board the other day and uh I don't know

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
board the other day and uh I don't know
I<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.779> kind<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> got<00:00:25.320> back<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.740> siren<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
I just kind of got back to my siren I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
I just kind of got back to my siren I
was<00:00:26.189> thinking<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.660> wonder<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.869> there<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> way

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
was thinking I wonder if there is a way

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.150 
was thinking I wonder if there is a way
to<00:00:28.349> make<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:29.039> siren<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> longer<00:00:30.660> line<00:00:30.900> down

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
to make my siren have a longer line down

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.020 
to make my siren have a longer line down
I've<00:00:32.160> been<00:00:32.279> trying<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.520> figure<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.880> way<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
I've been trying to figure out a way for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.270 
I've been trying to figure out a way for
a<00:00:33.270> long<00:00:33.420> time<00:00:33.750> try<00:00:34.170> capacitors<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.100> motor

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
a long time try capacitors the motor

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.860 
a long time try capacitors the motor
this<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:35.969> motor<00:00:36.180> didn't<00:00:36.510> work

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this with this motor didn't work

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.990 
this with this motor didn't work
and<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.739> I've<00:00:37.800> been<00:00:37.920> thinking<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> ways

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
and so I've been thinking of a ways

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.630 
and so I've been thinking of a ways
using<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.480> flywheel<00:00:39.930> or<00:00:40.170> something<00:00:40.640> are

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
using a flywheel or something are

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.040 
using a flywheel or something are
attaching<00:00:42.059> bolts

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
attaching bolts

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.619 
attaching bolts
none<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> those<00:00:43.739> ways<00:00:44.010> seem<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.550> logical<00:00:44.789> or

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
none of those ways seem very logical or

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.160 
none of those ways seem very logical or
easy<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> getting<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.809> centered

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
easy to do and getting it centered

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.880 
easy to do and getting it centered
really<00:00:49.440> well<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.730> too<00:00:50.940> hard<00:00:51.890> like

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
really well would be too hard like

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.549 
really well would be too hard like
making<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.489> didn't<00:00:53.699> vibrate<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.149> anything

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
making it so didn't vibrate or anything

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.840 
making it so didn't vibrate or anything
but<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.739> had<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.280> give<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.579> try<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but I just had to just give it a try and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.680 
but I just had to just give it a try and
I<00:00:57.030> came<00:00:57.980> across<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.250> washers<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.879> had<00:01:00.030> used

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
I came across these washers I had used

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.070 
I came across these washers I had used
for<00:01:00.840> making<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:02.030> Thunder<00:01:03.030> cane<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.600> thousand

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
for making the Thunder cane one thousand

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
for making the Thunder cane one thousand
four<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.439> yes<00:01:06.140> first<00:01:07.790> set<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> collect<00:01:09.119> rings

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
four so yes first set of collect rings

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
four so yes first set of collect rings
wouldn't<00:01:09.720> work<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.110> their<00:01:10.409> washers<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.250> they

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
wouldn't work but their washers and they

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
wouldn't work but their washers and they
have<00:01:11.520> quite<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> good<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.140> weight<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> them

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
have quite a good bit of weight to them

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.640 
have quite a good bit of weight to them
and<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.700> decided<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> first<00:01:15.360> try<00:01:16.320> putting<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and so I decided to first try putting on

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
and so I decided to first try putting on
the<00:01:16.710> top<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.100> chopper<00:01:17.750> sorry<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> can't

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the top of the chopper sorry I can't

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.679 
the top of the chopper sorry I can't
take<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.380> off<00:01:19.560> those<00:01:19.799> two<00:01:20.180> was<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.540> big

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
take this off those two was a really big

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.710 
take this off those two was a really big
pain<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.380> onto<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:23.130> right<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> put

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pain to get back onto just right but put

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.499 
pain to get back onto just right but put
try<00:01:24.960> putting<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.560> top<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.509> decided

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
try putting that on top and I decided

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.240 
try putting that on top and I decided
instead<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.200> gluing<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:28.979> which

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
instead of just gluing it on there which

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
instead of just gluing it on there which
was<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.640> too<00:01:29.850> risky<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.659> could<00:01:31.290> as

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
was just too risky and kind of could as

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.120 
was just too risky and kind of could as
a<00:01:31.579> fly<00:01:32.579> off<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.140> glued<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.619> bolted<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
a fly off I glued it and then bolted it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.550 
a fly off I glued it and then bolted it
on<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> bolted<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.439> was

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
on there but when I bolted it was it was

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
on there but when I bolted it was it was
uh<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:38.729> kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> warped<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> chopper<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
uh it kind of warped the chopper and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
uh it kind of warped the chopper and
didn't<00:01:40.229> make<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.650> spin<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.299> was

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
didn't make it a spin right and that was

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.370 
didn't make it a spin right and that was
too<00:01:42.630> top-heavy

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
too top-heavy

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.179 
too top-heavy
and<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.220> thinking<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.640> else<00:01:44.909> could<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:46.189> put

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and I was thinking what else could I put

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.580 
and I was thinking what else could I put
it<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.750> noticed<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.500> was

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it on there and I noticed that there was

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
it on there and I noticed that there was
a<00:01:49.649> little<00:01:49.860> bit<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> cavity<00:01:50.759> under<00:01:51.600> the
