home we're going to have to go over

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.930 
home we're going to have to go over
exactly<00:02:21.230> what<00:02:21.769> our<00:02:21.799> issue<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.489> but<00:02:22.730> this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
exactly what our issue is but this

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.560 
exactly what our issue is but this
tournament<00:02:23.450> we've<00:02:23.630> been<00:02:23.870> kind<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.260> famous<00:02:25.130> for

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
tournament we've been kind of famous for

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.940 
tournament we've been kind of famous for
letting<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.690> team<00:02:26.930> make<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.320> huge<00:02:27.680> comeback

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
letting the team make a huge comeback

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.400 
letting the team make a huge comeback
and<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.790> have<00:02:29.299> no<00:02:29.540> idea<00:02:29.660> what<00:02:29.989> happened

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
and I have no idea what happened

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.229 
and I have no idea what happened
yesterday<00:02:30.620> we<00:02:31.070> lost<00:02:31.340> two<00:02:31.519> mousesports<00:02:31.730> on

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
yesterday we lost two mousesports on

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.650 
yesterday we lost two mousesports on
nuke<00:02:32.930> after<00:02:33.620> winning<00:02:33.829> eleven<00:02:34.250> for<00:02:34.489> auntie<00:02:34.970> I

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
nuke after winning eleven for auntie I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.600 
nuke after winning eleven for auntie I
think<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.380> what<00:02:36.769> happens<00:02:37.160> is

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
think that what happens is

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.090 
think that what happens is
we<00:02:38.570> have<00:02:38.720> young<00:02:38.960> players<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.470> our<00:02:39.530> team<00:02:39.650> and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
we have young players on our team and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.040 
we have young players on our team and
you<00:02:40.400> know<00:02:40.520> we<00:02:40.700> get<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.570> tend<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.870> get<00:02:41.990> excited

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
you know we get we tend to get excited

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.130 
you know we get we tend to get excited
when<00:02:42.980> we're<00:02:43.160> winning<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.990> gets

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
when we're winning and I think it gets

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.860 
when we're winning and I think it gets
to<00:02:45.380> our<00:02:45.410> head<00:02:45.710> so<00:02:46.430> we<00:02:47.120> need<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.360> work<00:02:47.510> on<00:02:47.660> that

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
to our head so we need to work on that

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.590 
to our head so we need to work on that
and<00:02:48.170> we<00:02:48.380> need<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.800> be<00:02:48.950> more<00:02:49.100> patient<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.850> get

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
and we need to be more patient and get

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.660 
and we need to be more patient and get
some<00:02:50.840> more<00:02:50.990> experience<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.400> doesn't

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
some more experience so that it doesn't

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.360 
some more experience so that it doesn't
happen<00:02:52.880> again<00:02:53.120> will<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.140> see<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.860> same<00:02:55.100> team

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
happen again will we see the same team

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.370 
happen again will we see the same team
at<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.730> next<00:02:55.910> event<00:02:56.230> definitely<00:02:57.700> Jay<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.380> she

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
at the next event definitely Jay so she

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.230 
at the next event definitely Jay so she
has<00:03:00.560> some<00:03:00.980> stuff<00:03:01.250> going<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.640> her<00:03:01.820> life<00:03:01.850> but
