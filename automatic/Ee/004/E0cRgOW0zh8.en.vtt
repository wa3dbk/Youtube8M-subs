they're not cheap they're close to about

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
they're not cheap they're close to about
$100<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.600> an<00:01:00.690> unlock<00:01:00.930> code<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.410> iPhone

$100 to get an unlock code for an iPhone

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
$100 to get an unlock code for an iPhone
and<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> changes<00:01:02.850> depending<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and that changes depending on the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
and that changes depending on the
country<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> iPhone<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
country that the iPhone is from and the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.100 
country that the iPhone is from and the
carrier<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.549> locked<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.960> keep

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
carrier that it's locked to so just keep

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.149 
carrier that it's locked to so just keep
that<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.290> mind

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that in mind

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
that in mind
and<00:01:08.430> again<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> prices<00:01:09.840> might<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.170> down<00:01:10.380> at

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and again the prices might go down at

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.719 
and again the prices might go down at
some<00:01:10.530> point<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.010> remember<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.490> they<00:01:11.580> used

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
some point I do remember when they used

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.090 
some point I do remember when they used
to<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.909> $0.99<00:01:17.270> anywho<00:01:18.320> now<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.680> cost<00:01:19.860> closer

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to be $0.99 anywho now they cost closer

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
to be $0.99 anywho now they cost closer
to<00:01:20.220> 100<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> still<00:01:21.780> worth<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to 100 but if that is still worth it to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.450 
to 100 but if that is still worth it to
you<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.590> cheaper<00:01:23.009> than<00:01:23.040> buying<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you because it is cheaper than buying a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.620 
you because it is cheaper than buying a
new<00:01:23.610> iPhone<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> use<00:01:24.479> another

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
new iPhone if you want to use another

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.440 
new iPhone if you want to use another

out<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.280> SIM<00:04:08.520> tray<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.050> my<00:04:10.170> t-mobile

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
out the SIM tray so this is my t-mobile

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.680 
out the SIM tray so this is my t-mobile
SIM<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:11.069> device<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.519> locked<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.880> t-mobile<00:04:11.910> at

SIM the device is locked to t-mobile at

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.320 
SIM the device is locked to t-mobile at
the<00:04:12.780> moment<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:14.160> I'm<00:04:14.370> going<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.580> take<00:04:14.760> now<00:04:15.060> an

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
the moment so I'm going to take now an

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.470 
the moment so I'm going to take now an
unauthorised<00:04:16.049> sim<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> SIM<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:17.639> not<00:04:17.910> the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
unauthorised sim so a SIM that's not the

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.789 
unauthorised sim so a SIM that's not the
one<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.660> originally<00:04:19.139> came<00:04:19.290> with<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.620> device

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
one that originally came with the device

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.289 
one that originally came with the device
so<00:04:20.040> in<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.220> case<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.730> be<00:04:20.790> 18<00:04:20.940> T

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
so in this case it's going to be 18 T

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.810 
so in this case it's going to be 18 T
and<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:23.100> I'm<00:04:23.190> going<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.340> put<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:24.660> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
and then I'm going to put that in and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.690 
and then I'm going to put that in and
turn<00:04:26.820> on<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.450> phone<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:29.250> wait<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.639> to

turn on the phone and wait for it to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.210 
turn on the phone and wait for it to
start<00:04:29.880> up<00:04:30.139> and<00:04:31.139> once<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.500> reboots<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.919> may<00:04:32.040> ask

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
start up and once it reboots it may ask

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.860 
start up and once it reboots it may ask
you<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.610> activate<00:04:33.000> which<00:04:33.570> you'll<00:04:33.690> need<00:04:33.780> to

connect to a Wi-Fi network to do that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.840 
connect to a Wi-Fi network to do that
and<00:04:36.660> then<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.139> should<00:04:37.380> just<00:04:37.680> say<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.729> new
