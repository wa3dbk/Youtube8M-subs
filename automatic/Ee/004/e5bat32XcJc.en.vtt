00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.920
 we will talk now about the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.660
 liposuction and liposculpture 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.360
 Let's first talk about the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.650
 difference between that denomination 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.840
 liposuction liposuction 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.360
 Usually liposuction is when we 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.880
 we simply take away fat 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.210
 liposculpture is when we use 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.760
 this fat removal to add 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.920
 a little of that fat that is say 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.800
 thus filtered after being removed from the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 body to reject it in some 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.570
 other parts to achieve 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.300
 better harmonize the body silhouette or 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.379
 facial for fat removal 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.850
 we use canes like these that 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.570
 consist of a cylindrical structure 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.940
 with a few holes and these 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.670
 connected to a power source. 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.160
 vacuum going on this side of the cannula here 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.399
 end up causing the fat between 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.399
 here and get out of your body this way 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.530
 so we do this surgery like 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.140
 playing a violin with several 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.180
 repetitive movements so always 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.670
 taking care not to lose boring 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 internal structures always taking 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 careful not to leave the plane of the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.820
 to avoid accidents during 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.159
 this procedure 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 this type of surgery was for many 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.430
 the most performed surgery within the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.439
 Brazil, she is no longer the first 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.869
 place within the aesthetic surgeries in the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.960
 Brazil losing its position for prosthesis 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 of silicone but continues today as the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 second most performed surgery 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.450
 and undoubtedly it is a procedure 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.979
 surgical treatment most people have 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.869
 afraid to perform 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.600
 it is important to note that the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.970
 liposuction when performed by 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.240
 doctors with surgery training 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.560
 in the hospital environment 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.720
 conducive to this is a procedure 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.360
 extremely secure with a 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 complications and mortality 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.659
 low 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.509
 it is very important to differentiate the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.810
 liposuction performed at the hospital with a 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.000
 anesthesia usually epidural or local 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.640
 with an anesthetist together making a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.369
 celebration of that clean call lipo 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.010
 light olympic berlin 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.769
 and the mini lipo hydrolipo alone 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.250
 aspiration a number of trade names 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.980
 launched to do liposuction with 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.450
 local anesthesia in own practice 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.940
 Brazilian society of surgery 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.560
 has already positioned itself against 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.780
 this type of procedure is a 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.269
 procedure that generates much more risks 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.420
 the patient pointed out that anesthesia 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.120
 place placed in large nuts can give 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.450
 toxicity and cause a series of 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.239
 both brain and heart damage 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.250
 which can lead to undesirable events 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.530
 strange as it may sound like 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.870
 lipo in the environment 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.450
 hospital with anesthesiologist is a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.849
 a much safer procedure than 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.950
 a lipo performed under local anesthesia 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.620
 it is important to emphasize in the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.720
 that in the postoperative period of the lipo the care 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.329
 It is fundamental that it is important to 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.459
 lymphatic drainage and it is important 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.340
 Follow- up with doctor 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.769
 using a compressor belt one 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.010
 modeling strap for at least two 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.010
 weeks
