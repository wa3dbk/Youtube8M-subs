hi everyone sink here this video is

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi everyone sink here this video is
about<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.840> senses<00:00:04.200> i'm<00:00:04.350> considering<00:00:04.890> to

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
about the senses i'm considering to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.430 
about the senses i'm considering to
using<00:00:05.310> my<00:00:05.400> power<00:00:05.609> system<00:00:06.000> i<00:00:06.330> am<00:00:06.990> still<00:00:07.350> not

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
using my power system i am still not

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.410 
using my power system i am still not
completely<00:00:08.010> sure<00:00:08.160> but<00:00:08.340> whether<00:00:08.880> i'm<00:00:09.090> going<00:00:09.120> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
completely sure but whether i'm going to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.180 
completely sure but whether i'm going to
use<00:00:09.599> them<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.870> lot<00:00:09.900> other<00:00:10.349> side<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.830> later

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
use them a lot other side on that later

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.499 
use them a lot other side on that later
when<00:00:11.400> i<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.639> test<00:00:11.849> them<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.179> actually

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
when i can test them for actually

let's<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.680> small<00:00:53.100> for

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
let's get going so this is small for

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.209 
let's get going so this is small for

direction<00:01:29.280> sensor<00:01:29.689> meaning<00:01:30.689> i<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:30.990> need

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
direction sensor meaning i will need

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.310 
direction sensor meaning i will need
another<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.920> decrease<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> position

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
another one to decrease the position

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
lightly pressing on the sensor will

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
lightly pressing on the sensor will
slowly<00:01:35.729> increase<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.420> position<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.380> putting

slowly increase the position but putting

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.980 
slowly increase the position but putting
more<00:01:37.890> fortune<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.610> increase<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.570> position

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
more fortune will increase the position

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.830 
more fortune will increase the position
more<00:01:40.200> rapidly

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.780

related<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.040> reading<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.700> from<00:01:59.909> them

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
related to the reading I get from them

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.450 
related to the reading I get from them
this<00:02:00.900> will<00:02:01.080> obviously<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.590> used<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.100> safety

this will obviously be used for safety

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.820 
this will obviously be used for safety
reasons<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.900> quickly<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.440> position

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
reasons now that quickly the position

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.219 
reasons now that quickly the position
goes<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:05.790> long<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.180> takes<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> cool

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
goes up and how long it takes to cool

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
goes up and how long it takes to cool
down<00:02:07.259> again<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.640> shut<00:02:08.819> down<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> power

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
down again this will shut down the power

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.479 
down again this will shut down the power
system<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.929> render<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.289> inactive<00:02:11.100> until<00:02:11.250> it

system and render it inactive until it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:30.229 
system and render it inactive until it
is<00:02:11.610> sufficiently<00:02:12.150> cool<00:02:12.420> down

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.869 

this<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> flex<00:02:31.780> sensor<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:33.280> reading

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
this is a flex sensor it's reading

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.360 
this is a flex sensor it's reading

one<00:02:39.190> direction<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.909> reading<00:02:40.180> goes<00:02:40.360> up<00:02:40.599> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
one direction the reading goes up the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.280 
one direction the reading goes up the
other<00:02:40.989> way<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.379> goes<00:02:41.620> down<00:02:42.659> this<00:02:43.659> is<00:02:43.810> also<00:02:43.989> set

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
other way it goes down this is also set

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.110 
other way it goes down this is also set
up<00:02:44.379> as<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.610> directional<00:02:46.049> sensor<00:02:48.000> bending<00:02:49.000> it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
up as a directional sensor bending it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.440 
up as a directional sensor bending it
that<00:02:49.329> way<00:02:49.510> they<00:02:49.690> read<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.140> petition<00:02:50.409> goes<00:02:50.739> up

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that way they read the petition goes up

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.149 
that way they read the petition goes up
it's<00:02:52.450> pretty<00:02:52.840> good<00:02:53.110> controller<00:02:53.560> position

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
it's pretty good controller position

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.830 
it's pretty good controller position
pinning<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.730> backwards<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.569> goes<00:02:55.900> off<00:02:57.510> I'm<00:02:58.510> not

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
pinning it backwards it goes off I'm not

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.509 
pinning it backwards it goes off I'm not
completely<00:02:59.260> sure<00:02:59.530> what<00:02:59.709> I'm<00:03:00.010> gonna<00:03:00.129> do<00:03:00.370> with

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
completely sure what I'm gonna do with

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.099 
completely sure what I'm gonna do with
this<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.060> probably<00:03:01.720> going<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.049> be

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
this but it's probably going to be

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.369 
this but it's probably going to be
implemented<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.220> PI<00:03:03.459> system<00:03:04.140> because<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.290> a

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
implemented in PI system because it's a

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.680 
implemented in PI system because it's a
pretty<00:03:05.620> accurate<00:03:06.010> way<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.000> controlling

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
pretty accurate way of controlling

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:17.339 
pretty accurate way of controlling
system<00:03:09.000> yet<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.329> we'll<00:03:10.690> see<00:03:10.870> about<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:16.349> so

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
system yet so we'll see about that so

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.809 
system yet so we'll see about that so
these<00:03:17.590> are<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.829> sensors<00:03:18.159> I'm<00:03:18.430> good<00:03:18.609> news

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
these are the sensors I'm good news

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.080 
these are the sensors I'm good news
thanks<00:03:19.810> for<00:03:19.840> watching<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:21.220> hope<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.970> enjoyed
