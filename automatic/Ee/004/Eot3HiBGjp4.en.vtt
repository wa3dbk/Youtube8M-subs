I'm capturing all the speakers so it's

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.980 
I'm capturing all the speakers so it's

gonna have more versatility they all

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.320 
gonna have more versatility they all
sound<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.440> bit<00:01:16.470> different<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.250> cool<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.180> their

own way and definitely have that flavor
in<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:22.229> don't<00:01:22.440> limit<00:01:22.590> yourself<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> all

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420
