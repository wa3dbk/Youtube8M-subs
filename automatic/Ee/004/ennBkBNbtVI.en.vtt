00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.289

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.820
 a leading group of the seven participants, including this niels koole 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.660

 follow the pace 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 but everyone in the leading group still has to follow at that time 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.920
