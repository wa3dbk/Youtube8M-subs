00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:15.030
 3 video course lesson how easy it is to enlarge 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.279
 jump and the third block is 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.520
 systematic or coordination work 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.769
 muscle meaning that we must learn 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.439
 control muscles and how to make 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.609
 work our muscles improve the connection between 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.279
 brain and muscle 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.289
 performing an exercise from this unit is ours 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 the main task is speed communication 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.739
 signals sent from the brain directly to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 our muscles 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.960
 to increase our jump is very important 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.180
 feel and understand which 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.430
 groups work while doing 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 exercise and very important to learn 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.539
 use the greatest amount 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.480
 muscle fibers that is completely whole 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.309
 male muscle group and they are parts of them we 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.289
 forget to use some groups 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.890
 who are directly responsible for 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.680
 bounce 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 like buttocks hamstrings or 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.149
 quadriceps muscle while losing 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.710
 extra force which is so 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.470
 we need to jump 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 so this unit is based on how 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 teach you the key include buttocks 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.979
 quadriceps popliteal 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.590
 tendons and how to do it simultaneously 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.409
 so that as efficiently and simply as possible 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.740
 increase the jump is also another important 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.689
 block aspect is consistency 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.170
 corrected muscle imbalance lower 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.759
 body parts of many athletes 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.030
 quadriceps more developed than 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.979
 buttocks and hamstrings this 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.710
 big problem when you try 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.140
 jump so our program is aimed 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.689
 on activating our buttocks 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.119
 quadriceps and proper function 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.119
 to coordinate these muscle groups 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.960
 the first 3-4 weeks can bring big 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.600
 increases in leap strength 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.390
 this is probably due to improving your 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.390
 connections between the brain and muscles for 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.270
 the third unit of system I will give you three 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.399
 basic 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.729
 birth for training buttocks and 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.450
 quadriceps now we 'll talk about 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.950
 two functional motion models 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.310
 first exercise to help us include 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.739
 buttocks and she's called buttock squeezing 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.560
 stand up straight and all you need is 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.110
 periodically compress the buttocks thereby 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.440
 making them work the most important thing is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.110
 feels like they work second 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.660
 exercise is the bridge of the buttocks lie on 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.560
 half back and you have to make a bridge out 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.319
 legs and back 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.180
 while trying to squeeze the muscles of the buttocks 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.069
 as in the first exercise you should 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.230
 feel like these muscle groups 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:46.269
 shrink and work is very important 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.579
 the third exercise is a variation of the bridge 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.010
 buttocks and it's called the bridge 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.280
 hamstrings all you need 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.380
 lie on your back and push your legs a little 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.319
 further from the body getting up on the heels and 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.000
 repeat the bridge again from 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.879
 focus on popliteal work 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.950
 tendons by completing these three exercises we 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.690
 moving towards the functional model 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.609
 movements and i'm talking about squats and lunge 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.370
 let's start with squats but why are we 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.799
 doing these exercises we don't squat with 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.989
 weighing on our shoulders we work only with 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.389
 your weight you should not sharpen 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.220
 attention to the number of repetitions you 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.810
 should focus on 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.750
 muscle group work 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.239
 by the way legs are shoulder-width apart and start 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.970
 crouch like a chair below us 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.950
 after we straighten we must 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.319
 compress the buttocks as previous 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.840
 exercises to learn to 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.410
 learn how to incorporate this muscle group into 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.840
 while we straighten your body 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.030
 the most important thing you have to learn from 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.270
 this exercise is necessary 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.880
 connect to this 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.860
 birth still work muscles buttocks you 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.460
 should feel how these work 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.380
 muscles and hamstring muscles this 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.170
 very simple but extremely important 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.480
 exercise to teach the brain to include muscles 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.560
 legs and buttocks at the same time or 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.260
 consistently 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.960
 during the jump play an important role and 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.540
 buttocks and hamstrings after all 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.000
 it is not stored much of that 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.570
 energy forces that play an important role 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.330
 high jump last 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.930
 exercise 3 block consistency is 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.970
 lunges deep and shallow to 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.610
 make payments you need to set 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.670
 right foot forward and lower left 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.970
 knee to the floor your back and arms should 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.400
 be straight and in the same plane 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.650
 moving upright deep shallow 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.300
 lunge focuses on quadriceps 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.070
 muscles under the knee tendon and buttocks 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.710
 let's talk about the work of the quadriceps 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.930
 for this you need to perform a small lunge 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.780
 you need to take a very small step 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.760
 forward and lower the knee to the ground 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.250
 changing this exercise and start working 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.860
 buttocks need to do a deeper 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.690
 step forward and repeat for right and for 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.820
 left foot using these 5 basic ones 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.810
 exercise three exercise gain and two 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.790
 functional 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.950
 you really teach yourself 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.290
 use your muscles correctly and 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.290
 effectively to increase your jump
