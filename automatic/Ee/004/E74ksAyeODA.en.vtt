00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:34.150 

it's<00:01:21.740> right<00:01:21.890> over<00:01:21.920> here<00:01:22.189> somewhere

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.560 

let's<00:01:35.160> keep<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.370> hit<00:01:35.580> with<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.760> call<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.390> we

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
let's keep a hit with the call see we

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:52.000 
let's keep a hit with the call see we
can<00:01:36.780> come<00:01:37.050> this<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:49.790> got<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> nice<00:01:51.030> narrow<00:01:51.360> down

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
can come this way got a nice narrow down

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.690 
can come this way got a nice narrow down
in<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.220> tree<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:55.430> it's<00:01:56.430> hard<00:01:56.610> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
in that tree right there it's hard to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.790 
in that tree right there it's hard to
see<00:01:56.910> that's<00:01:57.810> why<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> used<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> shock<00:01:58.560> them

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
see that's why I used to shock them

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.820 
see that's why I used to shock them
because<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.340> those<00:01:59.490> leaves<00:01:59.760> start<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.830> if

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
because all those leaves start to see if

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:13.250 
because all those leaves start to see if
not<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.220> least<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.700> 22

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.289
