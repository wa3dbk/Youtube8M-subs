let's check the clip it's actually quite
big<00:04:16.700> I<00:04:17.289> happen<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:19.700> is<00:04:19.820> my<00:04:19.940> first<00:04:20.239> elite

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
blaster it's quite big

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.990 
blaster it's quite big
it<00:04:23.420> feels<00:04:23.690> like<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.900> 18<00:04:24.140> thought<00:04:24.620> clip<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.250> on

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
it feels like a 18 thought clip and on

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.500 
it feels like a 18 thought clip and on
the<00:04:26.380> weird<00:04:27.380> thing<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:28.040> think<00:04:28.280> no<00:04:29.000> it's

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
the weird thing that I think no it's

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.840 
the weird thing that I think no it's
like<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:30.050> don't<00:04:30.200> really<00:04:30.350> like<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:30.890> one

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
like I don't really like is that one

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.900 
like I don't really like is that one
side<00:04:32.090> is<00:04:32.120> like<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.510> on<00:04:32.630> one<00:04:32.660> side<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:32.990> clear

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
side is like that on one side is clear

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.550 
side is like that on one side is clear
it's<00:04:34.910> quite<00:04:35.120> good<00:04:35.150> but<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:36.110> just<00:04:36.380> don't<00:04:36.470> really

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
it's quite good but I just don't really

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.120 
it's quite good but I just don't really
like<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:37.010> but<00:04:37.550> still<00:04:37.790> it's<00:04:37.910> okay<00:04:38.920> okay

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.700 

yep<00:04:43.130> there's<00:04:43.430> still<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.910> Cesc<00:04:44.260> it's<00:04:45.260> quite<00:04:45.440> hard

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
yep there's still a Cesc it's quite hard

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.840 
yep there's still a Cesc it's quite hard
to<00:04:45.770> open<00:04:46.300> compared<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.510> weak<00:04:47.660> on<00:04:47.780> one<00:04:47.960> and

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
to open compared to the weak on one and

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.700 
to open compared to the weak on one and
the<00:04:49.850> inside<00:04:50.270> just<00:04:50.480> doesn't<00:04:50.840> look<00:04:50.960> that<00:04:51.020> like

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
the inside just doesn't look that like

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.470 
the inside just doesn't look that like
the<00:04:51.920> weak<00:04:52.040> are<00:04:52.190> because<00:04:53.000> it's<00:04:53.150> since<00:04:53.360> its

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
the weak are because it's since its

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.940 
the weak are because it's since its
direct<00:04:53.810> plunder<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:56.660> yeah<00:04:56.840> it's<00:04:57.110> pretty<00:04:57.200> cool

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
direct plunder and yeah it's pretty cool

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.990 
direct plunder and yeah it's pretty cool
but<00:04:58.760> now<00:04:58.940> let's<00:04:59.360> make<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.080> dots<00:05:00.350> worse<00:05:01.000> check

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
but now let's make the dots worse check

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.080 
but now let's make the dots worse check
some<00:05:02.240> more<00:05:02.330> range<00:05:02.600> yes<00:05:03.370> check<00:05:04.370> out<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.610> darts

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
some more range yes check out the darts

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.600 
some more range yes check out the darts
I<00:05:05.390> do<00:05:06.170> not<00:05:06.350> know<00:05:06.500> how<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.710> open<00:05:06.920> this<00:05:07.190> and<00:05:07.550> I'm

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
I do not know how to open this and I'm

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:20.940 
I do not know how to open this and I'm
scared<00:05:07.760> if<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.090> cut<00:05:08.360> those<00:05:08.570> don't<00:05:09.550> tear<00:05:10.550> it

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.090 

yep<00:05:21.950> so<00:05:22.280> this<00:05:22.670> is<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:22.970> dart<00:05:23.890> these<00:05:24.890> are<00:05:25.040> the

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
yep so this is the dart these are the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.190 
yep so this is the dart these are the
only<00:05:25.250> dark<00:05:25.550> they're<00:05:26.030> quite<00:05:26.270> it's<00:05:26.930> just

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
only dark they're quite it's just

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.480 
only dark they're quite it's just
similar<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.710> streamline<00:05:27.980> ones<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:30.490> it's

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
similar to the streamline ones and it's

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:39.430 
similar to the streamline ones and it's
just<00:05:36.040> okay<00:05:37.040> and<00:05:37.250> then<00:05:38.150> I've<00:05:38.270> gotta<00:05:38.450> get<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.780> UM

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440

just okay and then I've gotta get the UM
the<00:05:40.130> 18.1<00:05:40.970> since<00:05:41.660> it<00:05:41.840> looks<00:05:42.200> cooler<00:05:55.120> for<00:05:56.120> those

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
the 18.1 since it looks cooler for those

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.630 
the 18.1 since it looks cooler for those
people<00:05:56.570> who<00:05:56.720> like<00:05:56.930> adding<00:05:57.650> an<00:05:57.770> extra<00:05:58.130> dart<00:05:58.430> to

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
people who like adding an extra dart to

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.880 
people who like adding an extra dart to
the<00:05:58.670> 17<00:05:59.270> darts

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
the 17 darts

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.400 
the 17 darts
looks<00:06:01.460> like<00:06:01.640> there's<00:06:01.880> space<00:06:02.750> but<00:06:03.140> I<00:06:03.230> could

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
looks like there's space but I could

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.890 
looks like there's space but I could
hear<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.680> clicking<00:06:04.010> sound<00:06:04.400> so<00:06:04.700> I<00:06:04.970> don't<00:06:05.750> think

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
hear the clicking sound so I don't think

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.350 
hear the clicking sound so I don't think
it's<00:06:06.020> best<00:06:06.260> to<00:06:06.380> put<00:06:06.590> another<00:06:06.950> extra<00:06:07.250> Dart<00:06:07.640> yeah
