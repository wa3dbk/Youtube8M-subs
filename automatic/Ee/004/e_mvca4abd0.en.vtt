00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.850
 do not 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.720
 ah 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.650
 9na we are all in other languages ​​of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.200
 minecraft we are classes nap sot3 w 41 a 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.810
 so that hernán mulch by day is worth 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.000
 we are with you well here and the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.189
 first change that we see the largest of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.900
 stand up shot are the crystals already 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.090
 we can say goodbye to these crystals 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.830
 that we are all tired of him and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 he asked the welcome to all this range 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.199
 of colors of the crystals both of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.480
 crystal like crystal panel voucher 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.640
 As you can see we have a pretty variety 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.350
 as many as dyes there are 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.950
 any with clays and everything 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.170
 It has a variety of color, good and good 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.750
 because with this, the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 Minecraft decoration we can decorate 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 much more and we will see how it 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.410
 cartea is quite always as you see 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 here it would be all glass and the dye in 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.390
 we're going to do the demonstration like this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.729
 and the dye that we want in this case that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.590
 I have the blue here by hand then if 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.149
 you want to make honeycombs 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 that has been said plus the panels are three 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.290
 down and three in the middle we have the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.140
 panels and so with each color 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.080
 more changes to see the transparencies in 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.490
 improved the transparencies and now by 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.990
 example as you see the block of ice has 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.360
 been to improve transparency we can 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 see the water through what would happen 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.260
 if we put a portal on the other side of a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.660
 block of these is worth and then there is another 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.550
 thing that puts I do not know very well to what it 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.590
 they report that they have improved what is 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.200
 online code 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.460
 and that now they use something called having 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.250
 one point over here 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.289
 called netiq so I just do not know 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.210
 what do they mean but there's the 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.630
 code has been restructured or something by 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.700
 the style 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.179
 then here we have what the bars are 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.069
 the iron bars and panels are worth 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.819
 of glass have improved what is the 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:12.840
 union vale moix joins has been better 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.900
 everything more like saying it an improver that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.480
 in the union before we did not join and the one that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.849
 more little things like that the list of servers 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.920
 story they teach and also the adjustments 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.019
 of videos I do not notice big change because 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.660
 I have not played minecraft for a month 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.099
 for the computer but enter and have 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.030
 changed some of the video options 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.240
 it's not exactly what options 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.069
 and now we go to the multiplayer here 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.610
 anonymous as I am the snap 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.900
 where we have servers but in theory 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.400
 here when you put the people there 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.230
 connected let's say for example that there are 10 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.180
 people on a server that put 10 of 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.770
 I do not know how many of you have over 10 and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.959
 in theory it will show you who they are 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.300
 you know people are connected at least 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.390
 they just put the update blog to 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.260
 improve also the mtd is the message of the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.940
 day puts face support multiple lines 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.790
 and something from a server icon of ours 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.590
 30 who are concerned could not do in a 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.570
 kind of test but it seems that we could 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.330
 get to have icons in what is the 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.690
 list of servers is worth but at least 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.120
 That's what it says and what I think 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.240
 nothing else is nothing else is a snapshot 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.340
 as there is quite a short but that brings 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.640
 an improvement in terms of decoration 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.080
 quite important because it's something that 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.390
 we had hoped for a while now it's something 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.090
 pretty simple to implement in 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.760
 minecraft and they have waited long enough 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.320
 time to put it worth and well then 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.240
 that's all, many times to see 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.480
 the video see you in the next up 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.480
 soon
