00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.870
You ever walk into your Sunday morning
worship service and realize, "Hey look the

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.310
colors have changed!"

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.339
Weren't they green and now they're all blue?

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.700
How come they are never taupe?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.969
That's why this time we're talking about

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.789
liturgical colors on

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:21.789
Chuck Knows Church [fun intro music]

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.940
Adorning your church sanctuary with
different colors is actually done for a reason

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.200
based upon the liturgical calendar.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.360
you see the Christian year contains two cycles,
the Christmas cycle which includes

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.149
Advent, Christmas and the Epiphany

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.800
and the Easter cycle that includes Lent,
Easter

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.290
and Pentecost.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.160
It's a little confusing isn't it uh... maybe
these charts will help.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.660
Within each cycle is a preparatory
season symbolized by the color purple.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.090
And also a festival season symbolized
by the color white.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.150
And after each season there's an
ordinary season or time of growth

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.470
symbolized by the color

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.360
green.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.220
Thus there's a sequence of seasons using
purple,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.600
white and green in that order twice a year.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.570
[hum hum hum as points]

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.060
Now purple is the color of both
penitence

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.000
and royalty, used

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.160
during the preparatory seasons of Advent and Lent.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.740
Get that? Now white is the joyous or festive
color used during the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.630
Christmas or

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.920
Easter seasons. Uh... except on the day
of Pentecost.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.720
which, uh, we'll get to that in a minute.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.700
uh... Now green is the color of growth

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.030
used in the season's after the Epiphany, and after Pentecost.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.070
Except when

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.680
you know, special days call for..

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.700
white.. or..

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.379
uh...

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.880
red, which I've..

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.719
Red, being the color of

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.430
fire symbolizing the Holy
Spirit right is only used on the day of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.469
Pentecost and, uh,..

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.569
[whispering to self] slide this one over

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.729
You saw on the day.. We use is occasionally, sparingly more likely

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.200
so it's more effective and along enough

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.700
um...

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.940
Now creativity

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.359
when using color from a different days
and seasons

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.369
is encouraged.

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.329
Be sure to check with your pastor if you want to learn more.

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.619
And tell them Chuck sent ya'.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.220
I don't even know where to start.
