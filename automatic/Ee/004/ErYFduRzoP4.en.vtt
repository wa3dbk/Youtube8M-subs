00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 You are and I have no sword 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.049
 age I walked the streets 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 okay we are everywhere monster my god 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.559
 ok i come to you wait wait years 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.970
 everywhere the sun rises again 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:24.570
 the sun goes back to old, what's up 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:28.380
 and here is also we play today 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.880
 together with the adventure map why with 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:38.540
 minecraft sachs was you doing everything 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:41.700
 broken really cool really 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.559
 we discovered ourselves, so to speak 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.239
 So there is no map like the dropper for 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.649
 example everyone already knows I do 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.750
 here always at the beginning that we are not with 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.860
 start from hunger that's not really 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 thought so in the beginning 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 hours then tells us always 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.860
 cake a bit but we will 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.670
 Of course we are reluctant with 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.989
 decided here in the recording 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.699
 Accordingly , I was right in 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.830
 Game Mode 0 and I would say that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 look at the box of books with two books 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.520
 in it just once 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 but before we read the books here 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.580
 first little explanation in advance 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.100
 this sequence he sees is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 Probability on both channels 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.240
 and the next episode will say it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.240
 just on my channel that ok 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.600
 next episode will be his channel for this 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.579
 then the one after the other could prove that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.689
 is relatively widespread that 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.189
 principle and and say already starts 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.189
 the intro or the rules 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.030
 By the way, that means as much as the plague 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.820
 A deadly plague has a world 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.570
 reached and all people are people 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.760
 transform all people 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 everyone is slowly turning into 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.260
 crazy meat eating monster you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.979
 you have to find a way your world and 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.600
 to save the planet from the plague 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.160
 I think that creates team disease 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.400
 easy that is the rules completely 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.110
 simply we are not allowed any blocks 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.470
 just destroy or break down 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.709
 unless they belong to quest or to 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.900
 task no mods speak no mini map 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.310
 or bells and whistles everything possible so whether 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:42.120
 the fine so natural is clear though 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:43.530
 no and a player or more are 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.430
 we allow play on the normal 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.900
 Definitely away we'll be in 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.400
 outside and then we teleport to the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 start again a piece of cake 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.019
 eaten 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.100
 Are you ready for the big adventure? 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.590
 starts the adventure 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.799
 okay we are here in front of this weird one 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.390
 haus believes that it seems like the door 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.190
 to the house seems to be closed 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.690
 maybe one is maybe one 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:15.570
 spear no idea maybe one is 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 key around the house with the shots 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.890
 as clear goes directly in because it yes 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.690
 after content and the story and yes 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.610
 already we have already noticed that 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.410
 there are some gods everywhere 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.410
 already such a monster in front 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.989
 There is a bit faster here than here 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.480
 lewis is about it again I have 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 already two score points lukas I hope 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.989
 on points 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.519
 i expect scorepoints i have and 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.500
 a sword jamies player 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.420
 okay, who enjoys that 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.980
 no idea so I think we ignite 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.220
 but still get a book somewhere 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.440
 or so year two piece home course 1 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.140
 So our first quest and jamie story 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:14.670
 what you read before 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:17.570
 I want to read jamie story read aloud 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.269
 he yesterday first fourth 13 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.740
 everyone I knew is dead no that 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.580
 is stupid that if you literally 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.140
 So everyone wants to translate the English 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.500
 map play and just no english 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.510
 can 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.910
 you can you namely each as each of the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.169
 i knew died from the plague 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.540
 I should I should 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.040
 probably break down i leave mine 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.200
 house now so the next day 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:45.419
 I leave my house is every one of that 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.820
 everyone who reads this should know that me 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.000
 most likely in the city 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.669
 serve the wall because they say that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.710
 they have them because they say they are 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.450
 have a cure i hope for that 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.729
 best that is not translated literally 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.740
 but so I think that then 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.570
 already infected or that starts in 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.960
 berlin have a cure civil 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:13.290
 That's why we look for the best west 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:18.150
 Jamie finds in the city before doing 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:21.210
 wanted and find out what the situation 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.280
 is the plant then the question I would 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:32.160
 let me go to sleep that 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:38.790
 outside 1010 was on top of that both in 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:40.770
 correspond to the night on the monster 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.990
 the monster as I got away ages 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.310
 I cash in here right in hÃ¼ls from ok 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.490
 I think just go away 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.120
 along the street or long waiting lists 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.410
 pigs 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.430
 I think we can just be one 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.229
 a little something to eat and if you already 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.210
 out in the country are true 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.570
 already that benefits directly at home 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.180
 that's something to come with the cellar 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.320
 We're walking along the way 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.700
 There is some bridge in front with one 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.590
 sign right away 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.449
 So you can in any case already 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.550
 in the lot 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.680
 Indicator write in the comments 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.580
 read here on the right track are 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.229
 ever write the comments 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.729
 why the first impression of the map 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.289
 So I think it is definitely 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.479
 really cool 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.219
 So that was still a new card 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.870
 download links I think we'll pack 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:26.839
 you in the description and directly 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:28.039
 order with lukas behind it because the 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.289
 Above all, see war as well as when 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.779
 one this one if one the motion blur 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:36.650
 Ultra shader in it and it's all 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.839
 then set to dark in rudow plates 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.279
 but we have the nation war in kryta 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:45.229
 by kripo and lukas literally 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.539
 Maybe you are I do not have any 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.969
 sword age i am the street long 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.960
 Run and they are everywhere 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.969
 monster my god 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.889
 ok I could wait you wait everywhere 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:07:04.699
 But the sun often goes back to the sun 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:06.259
 goes back to the pig comes 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.729
 quickly fast further further fast 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.620
 further condition before using the lord 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:13.659
 instead of and there is the city in front 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.659
 we survived lukas the first night 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:21.800
 spot we say keep the parts all 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.300
 so 10 minutes since we 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.300
 probably neat neat 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.439
 So we both have to do that a lot 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.300
 means i will just go 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.520
 let's say we make a little one 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.689
 cut and what's in there in the city or 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.050
 so that already expects you in the 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:38.659
 make second episode or something 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.159
 yes that's right it's an interesting one 

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:41.419
 and there is really beautiful 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.759
 but the sun on it would say mine 

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:45.800
 dear friends the next episode again 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:48.589
 which will then appear with me 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.099
 next to lukas channel so white 

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:54.999
 channel looks so well and then are tuned 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:54.999
 so exactly
