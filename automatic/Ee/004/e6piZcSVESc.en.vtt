take very regular measurements of their

take very regular measurements of their
chlorophyll<00:02:45.170> fluorescence<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:45.980> the

chlorophyll fluorescence and the

chlorophyll fluorescence and the

measurements that I get back point eight
for<00:02:49.639> example<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.530> indicative<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.829> very

for example is a indicative of a very

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.199 
for example is a indicative of a very
healthy<00:02:52.340> plant<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.030> zero<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
healthy plant and zero is the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.670 
healthy plant and zero is the
measurement<00:02:56.599> that<00:02:56.810> you'll<00:02:56.989> get<00:02:57.200> with<00:02:57.349> a<00:02:57.409> plant

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
measurement that you'll get with a plant

measurement that you'll get with a plant
that's<00:02:57.769> dead<00:02:58.400> or<00:02:59.379> fully<00:03:00.379> desiccated<00:03:01.099> we<00:03:01.280> can

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
that's dead or fully desiccated we can

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.250 
that's dead or fully desiccated we can
find<00:03:01.669> out<00:03:01.819> which<00:03:02.150> species<00:03:02.480> here<00:03:03.049> are

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
find out which species here are

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.830 
find out which species here are
desiccation<00:03:04.040> tolerant<00:03:04.519> which<00:03:05.299> aren't<00:03:05.629> and

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
desiccation tolerant which aren't and

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.890 
desiccation tolerant which aren't and
which<00:03:06.379> ones<00:03:06.620> are<00:03:06.769> somewhere<00:03:07.069> in<00:03:07.129> between

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
which ones are somewhere in between

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.900 
which ones are somewhere in between
thanks
