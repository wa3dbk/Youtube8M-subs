00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
handmade here in Seattle Washington

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.380 
handmade here in Seattle Washington
these<00:00:24.770> are<00:00:25.009> roughly<00:00:25.310> about<00:00:25.490> three<00:00:25.759> inches<00:00:26.150> and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
these are roughly about three inches and

these are roughly about three inches and
about<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.660> half<00:00:26.990> an<00:00:27.140> inch<00:00:27.200> in<00:00:27.380> diameter<00:00:28.000> no<00:00:29.560> I'm

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
about a half an inch in diameter no I'm

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.929 
about a half an inch in diameter no I'm
going<00:00:30.739> to<00:00:30.770> I'm<00:00:30.950> going<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.189> kind<00:00:31.579> of<00:00:31.610> explain<00:00:31.910> a

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
going to I'm going to kind of explain a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.729 
going to I'm going to kind of explain a
little<00:00:32.119> bit<00:00:32.300> why<00:00:32.480> either<00:00:32.660> must-have<00:00:33.320> for<00:00:33.500> any

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
little bit why either must-have for any

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.010 
little bit why either must-have for any
artist<00:00:34.160> now<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:34.970> biggest<00:00:35.420> difference<00:00:35.809> is

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
artist now the biggest difference is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.020 
artist now the biggest difference is
you've<00:00:36.590> seen<00:00:36.770> other<00:00:36.980> like<00:00:37.250> colored<00:00:37.579> pencils

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
you've seen other like colored pencils

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.139 
you've seen other like colored pencils
which<00:00:38.690> are<00:00:38.960> binded<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:40.550> make<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.760> little<00:00:41.000> bit<00:00:41.120> a

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
which are binded to make a little bit a

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.810 
which are binded to make a little bit a
little<00:00:41.510> bit<00:00:41.800> harder<00:00:42.800> inside<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.489> actual

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
little bit harder inside the actual

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.730 
little bit harder inside the actual
pencil<00:00:44.030> itself<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:45.080> they<00:00:45.170> don't<00:00:45.350> melt<00:00:45.530> as

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
pencil itself so they don't melt as

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.860 
pencil itself so they don't melt as
nicely<00:00:45.920> on<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.250> paper<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:47.540> might<00:00:47.720> also

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
nicely on the paper and you might also

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.040 
nicely on the paper and you might also
see<00:00:48.230> let's<00:00:48.920> say<00:00:49.130> watercolor<00:00:50.000> cran<00:00:50.390> which<00:00:50.870> is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
see let's say watercolor cran which is

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.130 
see let's say watercolor cran which is
binded<00:00:51.470> by<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.680> clay<00:00:52.480> which<00:00:53.480> again<00:00:53.780> doesn't

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
binded by a clay which again doesn't

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.500 
binded by a clay which again doesn't
melt<00:00:54.350> as<00:00:54.530> nicely<00:00:54.850> now<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.910> biggest<00:00:56.270> dis

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
melt as nicely now the biggest dis

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.480 
melt as nicely now the biggest dis
between<00:00:56.840> these<00:00:57.050> is<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.040> fact<00:00:58.190> these<00:00:58.430> are

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
between these is the fact these are

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.550 
between these is the fact these are
abundant<00:00:58.820> with<00:00:58.880> pure<00:00:59.150> gum<00:00:59.390> arabic<00:00:59.630> gum<00:01:00.350> arabic

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
abundant with pure gum arabic gum arabic

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.400 
abundant with pure gum arabic gum arabic
is<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.490> binder<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.180> binds<00:01:02.600> all<00:01:02.840> watercolors

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
is the binder that binds all watercolors

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.280 
is the binder that binds all watercolors
together<00:01:03.790> it<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:05.119> just<00:01:05.449> enough<00:01:05.689> gum<00:01:05.840> arabic<00:01:06.049> to

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
together it is just enough gum arabic to

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.710 
together it is just enough gum arabic to
hold<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.710> nice<00:01:06.890> stick<00:01:07.579> so<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.540> nice
