00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:23.869
 we take for this hexagon then it 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.640
 process from each vertex to 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.840
 opposite top through the center and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.469
 draw a guide line due to this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.960
 we'll find the center 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:41.090
 exactly the direction to lay 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.530
 petals of a single layer of us 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.610
 we process all cuts 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.670
 singe them so that they could not 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:58.489
 so start taking the lower edge 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:07.880
 iron guided to the center 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:16.619
 clearly along the line to the center 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.560
 that is, the previous one again serve so 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.560
 and iron out 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.100
 our next actions will be such 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:57.220
 take any petal that is edge 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:11.140
 petals of the future and the middle of it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:15.430
 spread center fixing little corner too 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.989
 we fix the center we turn down too 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:26.519
 we fix as far as possible 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:35.769
 it turns out somewhere 05 needle secured 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:40.739
 iron fixed the next petal 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:44.489
 all the same repeat also 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.489
 fasten and bending down 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.250

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:08.200
 we got here right in the middle 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:14.680
