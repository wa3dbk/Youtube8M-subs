00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.820
 how to deal with it is a dish based 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.379
 fine vermicelli steamed 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 for that you will need an inch 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.600
 dust if you do not have any you can 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.900
 use included electric steam 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 I start with about 2 liters 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 of water in the couscous pot 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.960
 play the fnac on fire for the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 vermicelli will have to choose the variety the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.399
 finer or usually find it 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.219
 either in supermarkets or in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.930
 shops at the level there I want a package 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.510
 of 500 grams that I pour into a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.980

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.159
 mixing while making sure to separate 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.039
 vermicelli to prevent them 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.140

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.539
 with your fingers or if it's too hot to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.909
 using a fork is used mostly 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:58.009
 not a spoon because it may 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.009
 break the angel hair 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.230
