those funny answers coming in and this
is<00:00:46.300> what<00:00:46.450> these<00:00:46.600> things<00:00:46.840> look<00:00:46.989> like<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
is what these things look like and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.590 
is what these things look like and
they're<00:00:50.500> really<00:00:50.620> made<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:51.040> two<00:00:51.280> pieces

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
they're really made of two pieces

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.090 
they're really made of two pieces
there's<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.660> little<00:00:52.899> spring<00:00:53.890> here<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.890> is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
there's a little spring here that is

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.810 
there's a little spring here that is
held<00:00:57.670> in<00:00:57.940> these<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:59.320> retainer<00:00:59.800> but<00:01:00.579> all<00:01:00.789> I

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
held in these this retainer but all I

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.549 
held in these this retainer but all I
could<00:01:01.180> get<00:01:01.390> from<00:01:01.719> all<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.079> answers<00:01:02.530> are

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
could get from all of the answers are

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.620 
could get from all of the answers are
this<00:01:02.890> is<00:01:03.100> some<00:01:03.370> type<00:01:03.879> of<00:01:04.560> aircraft<00:01:05.560> panel

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this is some type of aircraft panel

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040 
this is some type of aircraft panel
fastener<00:01:08.009> applicator<00:01:09.009> tools<00:01:09.369> so<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.090> believe

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
fastener applicator tools so I believe

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.030 
fastener applicator tools so I believe
these<00:01:11.410> were<00:01:11.890> used<00:01:12.369> on<00:01:12.670> aircraft<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:13.690> hold

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
these were used on aircraft to hold

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.320 
these were used on aircraft to hold
access<00:01:15.040> panels<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.700> different<00:01:16.060> things<00:01:16.180> like

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
access panels and different things like

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.570 
access panels and different things like
that<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.020> suppose<00:01:17.260> other<00:01:17.740> applications

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
that on and I suppose other applications

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.179 
that on and I suppose other applications
as<00:01:18.850> well<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.600> somebody<00:01:19.810> suggested<00:01:20.500> brand

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
as well and somebody suggested brand

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.060 
as well and somebody suggested brand
names<00:01:21.520> such<00:01:21.790> as<00:01:21.820> tried<00:01:22.330> air<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.619> on<00:01:23.799> but<00:01:24.040> I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
names such as tried air and so on but I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.469 
names such as tried air and so on but I
never<00:01:24.340> could<00:01:24.580> find<00:01:24.790> anything<00:01:25.119> on<00:01:25.360> the

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
never could find anything on the

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.240 
never could find anything on the
internet<00:01:25.900> but<00:01:26.080> we're<00:01:26.530> gonna<00:01:26.619> have<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.890> let<00:01:27.070> it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
internet but we're gonna have to let it

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
internet but we're gonna have to let it
go<00:01:27.400> with<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:28.540> it<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:29.430> aircraft<00:01:30.430> panel

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
go with that that it is a aircraft panel

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.149 
go with that that it is a aircraft panel

and someone said that it is a tool used

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.289 
and someone said that it is a tool used
our<00:02:01.990> range<00:02:02.590> finder<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.939> don't<00:02:04.000> know<00:02:04.210> if

our range finder and I don't know if

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.139 
our range finder and I don't know if
that<00:02:04.450> meant<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.899> was<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> gun<00:02:05.439> or<00:02:06.149> some

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
that meant that it was on a gun or some

that meant that it was on a gun or some
other<00:02:07.299> military<00:02:07.869> application<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:08.709> but

other military application but but

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.990 
other military application but but
somebody<00:02:09.459> said<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.790> was<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.910> rangefinder<00:02:10.540> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
somebody said it was a rangefinder and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.310 
somebody said it was a rangefinder and
I'll<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.269> have<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.540> take<00:02:13.690> your<00:02:13.900> word<00:02:14.049> for

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
that because this is rather obscure and

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.820 
that because this is rather obscure and
it<00:02:17.950> isn't<00:02:18.190> really<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> tool<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.030> don't<00:02:19.450> believe

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
it isn't really a tool I don't believe

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.060

anybody<00:02:37.310> would<00:02:37.490> get<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.720> had<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> lot

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
anybody would get this but I had a lot

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.940 
anybody would get this but I had a lot
of<00:02:40.160> positive<00:02:40.960> correct<00:02:41.960> answers<00:02:42.440> on<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:42.770> as

by<00:02:43.190> Boston<00:02:43.760> Scientific<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.110> were<00:02:45.260> right

by Boston Scientific and you were right

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.150 
by Boston Scientific and you were right
that<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.980> was<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.870> sterile<00:02:47.950> that's<00:02:48.950> why<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
that it was a sterile that's why I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.940 
that it was a sterile that's why I
wasn't<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.670> package<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.470> indeed

wasn't in this package and it is indeed

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.870

probably cost $400 that was just a

probably cost $400 that was just a
little<00:03:04.460> protector<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.660> had<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:05.930> laugh

little protector and I had to laugh

little protector and I had to laugh
somebody<00:03:06.410> said<00:03:06.740> you<00:03:06.860> need<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> pair<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.340> those

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
somebody said you need a pair of those

of expensive and it has a square end on
it<00:03:22.840> by<00:03:23.840> directional<00:03:24.550> meaning<00:03:25.550> you<00:03:26.000> could<00:03:26.210> I

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
it by directional meaning you could I

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.040 
it by directional meaning you could I
can<00:03:28.340> rotate<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.180> little<00:03:29.300> bit<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.840> each

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
can rotate it just a little bit in each

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.750 
can rotate it just a little bit in each
direction<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.739> I<00:03:30.860> can<00:03:31.040> feel<00:03:31.250> it

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
direction and I can feel it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.199 
direction and I can feel it
clicking<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.070> don't<00:03:34.430> know<00:03:34.550> I<00:03:34.580> assume<00:03:35.180> that

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
clicking now I don't know I assume that

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.000 
clicking now I don't know I assume that
they<00:03:35.600> don't<00:03:35.780> stick<00:03:36.050> that<00:03:36.260> through<00:03:36.560> your<00:03:36.709> skin

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
they don't stick that through your skin

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.920 
they don't stick that through your skin
that<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.940> was<00:03:38.150> done<00:03:38.330> when<00:03:38.540> they<00:03:38.660> put<00:03:38.810> the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
that this was done when they put the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.470 
that this was done when they put the
pacemaker<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:39.760> maybe<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.000> don't<00:03:41.300> have<00:03:41.420> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
pacemaker in maybe that I don't have a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.300 
pacemaker in maybe that I don't have a
pacemaker<00:03:41.720> hope<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.350> never<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.800> but<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.130> bet

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
pacemaker hope I never have to but I bet

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.380 
pacemaker hope I never have to but I bet
there's<00:03:43.489> plenty<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.910> guys<00:03:44.120> out<00:03:44.360> there

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
there's plenty of you guys out there

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.800 
there's plenty of you guys out there
that<00:03:44.660> had<00:03:45.370> pacemakers<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:47.180> don't<00:03:47.239> know<00:03:47.570> if

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
that had pacemakers and I don't know if

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.990 
that had pacemakers and I don't know if
they<00:03:47.959> just<00:03:47.989> adjusted<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.860> at<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.520> time<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
they just adjusted it at the time of the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.750 
they just adjusted it at the time of the
operation<00:03:50.120> or<00:03:50.930> if<00:03:51.410> they<00:03:51.800> come<00:03:52.100> back<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.370> make

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
operation or if they come back and make

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.710 
operation or if they come back and make
little<00:03:53.120> adjustments<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.900> your<00:03:54.370> pacemaker<00:03:55.370> as

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
little adjustments to your pacemaker as

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.040 
little adjustments to your pacemaker as
needed<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.070> that<00:03:58.070> was<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.550> number<00:03:59.050> that

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
needed and that was the number that

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.699 
needed and that was the number that
stands<00:04:00.500> for<00:04:00.530> Boston<00:04:01.310> Scientific<00:04:02.320> which<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.500> did

not<00:04:03.739> know<00:04:03.920> but<00:04:04.370> several<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.269> recognized<00:04:05.750> that

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
not know but several you recognized that

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.920 
not know but several you recognized that
I<00:04:06.050> think<00:04:06.380> that<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.160> did<00:04:07.370> some<00:04:07.690> research<00:04:08.690> when

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
I think that you did some research when

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.210 
I think that you did some research when
you<00:04:09.050> saw<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.470> maybe<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.830> shouldn't<00:04:10.070> have

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
you saw that maybe I shouldn't have

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.479 
you saw that maybe I shouldn't have
shown<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:11.830> all<00:04:12.830> right<00:04:12.950> thank<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.250> for
