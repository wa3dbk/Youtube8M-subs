could be extraterrestrial and what we're

could be extraterrestrial and what we're
all<00:02:34.080> asking<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.010> book<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.580> we

all asking for in this book that we

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.000 
all asking for in this book that we
think<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.300> important<00:02:36.840> enough<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
think it's important enough that the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.770 
think it's important enough that the
scientists<00:02:38.760> around<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> world<00:02:39.120> pool<00:02:39.540> their

scientists around the world pool their

resources and try to find out what they

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.790 
resources and try to find out what they
are<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.239> mean<00:02:42.269> who<00:02:42.870> could<00:02:43.019> not<00:02:43.230> want<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.650> know

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
are I mean who could not want to know

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.949 
are I mean who could not want to know
that<00:02:44.160> there<00:02:45.120> are<00:02:45.150> when<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.600> are<00:02:45.690> strange

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
that there are when there are strange

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.810 
that there are when there are strange
things<00:02:46.050> flying<00:02:46.530> around<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.920> sky<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.459> behave

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
things flying around the sky that behave

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.430 
things flying around the sky that behave
in<00:02:48.120> ways<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:48.900> don't<00:02:49.019> have<00:02:49.230> technology

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
in ways that we don't have technology

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.640 
in ways that we don't have technology
for<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.580> can't<00:02:50.850> explain<00:02:51.150> them<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:52.290> they<00:02:52.590> could

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
for we can't explain them if they could

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.020 
for we can't explain them if they could
if<00:02:52.920> there's<00:02:53.069> even<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.310> small<00:02:53.459> chance<00:02:53.610> they

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
if there's even a small chance they

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.790 
if there's even a small chance they
could<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.330> coming<00:02:54.569> from<00:02:54.780> somewhere<00:02:55.050> else<00:02:55.380> it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
could be coming from somewhere else it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.440 
could be coming from somewhere else it
seems<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.340> me<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:56.640> worthy<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.090> our<00:02:57.390> attention

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
seems to me it's worthy of our attention

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.840 
seems to me it's worthy of our attention
and<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.620> need<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.860> find<00:02:59.040> out<00:02:59.190> more<00:02:59.370> about<00:02:59.459> them

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
and we need to find out more about them

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.000 
and we need to find out more about them
well<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.510> think<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.840> unexplained<00:03:01.380> both<00:03:01.680> you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
well I think the unexplained both you

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.820 
well I think the unexplained both you
know<00:03:02.130> fascinates<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.030> scares<00:03:03.810> people<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.650> if

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
know fascinates and scares people and if

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.400 
know fascinates and scares people and if
there's<00:03:05.010> anybody<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.940> would<00:03:06.840> be<00:03:07.050> worried

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
there's anybody that would be worried

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.210 
there's anybody that would be worried
about<00:03:07.440> something<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.860> they<00:03:08.010> couldn't

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
about something that they couldn't

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.770 
about something that they couldn't
necessarily<00:03:08.340> explain<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.390> they<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.660> they

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
necessarily explain that they know they

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.630 
necessarily explain that they know they
couldn't<00:03:10.019> defeat<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.800> probably<00:03:11.280> would<00:03:11.610> be

couldn't defeat that probably would be

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.490 
couldn't defeat that probably would be
the<00:03:12.030> US<00:03:12.299> government<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:12.959> US<00:03:13.019> military

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the US government and the US military

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.380 
the US government and the US military
you<00:03:13.980> know<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.130> mean<00:03:14.340> why<00:03:14.850> do<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.090> think<00:03:15.239> that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
you know I mean why do you think that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.240 
you know I mean why do you think that
they<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.840> cover<00:03:16.140> these<00:03:16.440> things<00:03:16.860> up<00:03:17.070> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
they like to cover these things up and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.740 
they like to cover these things up and
they<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.640> keep<00:03:17.820> them<00:03:18.030> secret<00:03:18.269> because

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
they like to keep them secret because

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.810 
they like to keep them secret because
would<00:03:18.959> they<00:03:19.079> be<00:03:19.140> admitting<00:03:20.010> perhaps<00:03:20.549> some<00:03:20.730> of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
would they be admitting perhaps some of

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.870 
would they be admitting perhaps some of
their<00:03:20.940> own<00:03:21.030> weaknesses<00:03:21.570> there<00:03:22.579> yeah<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.610> mean

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
their own weaknesses there yeah I mean

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.250 
their own weaknesses there yeah I mean
it's<00:03:24.030> possible<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.540> again<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:24.810> don't<00:03:24.989> know<00:03:25.200> to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
it's possible and again we don't know to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.380 
it's possible and again we don't know to
what<00:03:25.440> extent<00:03:25.620> things<00:03:26.610> are<00:03:26.790> being<00:03:26.940> kept<00:03:27.180> secret

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
what extent things are being kept secret

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.270 
what extent things are being kept secret
by<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.810> government<00:03:28.380> we<00:03:28.470> don't<00:03:28.650> know<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:29.250> what

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
by the government we don't know to what

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280 
by the government we don't know to what
extent<00:03:29.459> they<00:03:29.970> do<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.390> what<00:03:30.900> these<00:03:31.079> things

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
extent they do know what these things

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.229 
extent they do know what these things
are<00:03:31.560> don't<00:03:31.950> know<00:03:32.070> what<00:03:32.250> they<00:03:32.430> are<00:03:32.459> but

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
are don't know what they are but

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.120 
are don't know what they are but
certainly<00:03:33.660> they<00:03:33.870> must<00:03:33.900> be<00:03:34.230> baffled<00:03:34.470> by<00:03:34.890> them

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
certainly they must be baffled by them

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.860 
certainly they must be baffled by them
and<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.519> know<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:35.880> understandable<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.660> me

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
and you know it's understandable to me

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.050 
and you know it's understandable to me
that<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.470> government<00:03:38.430> would<00:03:38.670> not<00:03:38.850> want

especially the United States government

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.960 
especially the United States government
would<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.799> want<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.040> step<00:03:41.250> out<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.549> say<00:03:41.760> well

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
unexplained phenomenon in the sky and

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.130 
unexplained phenomenon in the sky and
nobody's<00:04:05.820> panicked<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.660> hasn't<00:04:06.810> caused

information so we you know we don't have
to<00:06:19.740> it<00:06:19.950> not<00:06:20.460> like<00:06:20.700> if<00:06:21.030> they<00:06:21.240> set<00:06:21.479> this<00:06:21.630> agency

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
to it not like if they set this agency

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.780 
to it not like if they set this agency
up<00:06:22.349> they<00:06:22.979> don't<00:06:23.099> they're<00:06:23.430> just
