00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.970
 to install finally said at last because 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:21.500

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.730
 official android 4.2.2 Spanish what 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.150
 is the official one we are going to expel at the same time 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.310
 for someone to enter the recovery mode 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.490
 ok because we need to first enter the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.840
 recovery for 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:42.570
 to them to do it 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.570
 the wii the the two eggs ok 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.620
 as we can see we are entering 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.670
 recovery mode and what we're going to do what 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.460
 first thing we're going to do is apply 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.690
 We are going to apply the datafactory with 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.789
 reset we give the power button with 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.769
 the keys to lower the volume upload the 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.110
 volume we go down to where it puts 10 of 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.320
 letea luther dates this what he's going to do 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.369
 is to erase all data applications 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.740
 configurations that have to be 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.690
 we would have had here where we already 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.030
 we have had here in the merry-go-round because 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.390
 As we can see , the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.490
 Wifi 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.930
 then what I'm going to do next 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.990
 next I will do what is the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.650
 cache partition to erase all the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.690
 cache of the previous course that as 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.550
 we can see it is already then it would already be 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.420
 list nothing but plug in the 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.220
 usb cable and through odín to put the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.440
 new start because nothing is going to it 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.470
 I can mates once we've done 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.650
 and the guays are going to enter mode 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.020
 download and for this we are going to download the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.450
 power button plus the down the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.960
 volume at once ok and we go into this 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.080
 mode 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.600
 let's plug in the cable the usb cable 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.700
 jaló to the computer and we are going to plug it 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.460
 here remember that you have to have 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.409
 installed the one that is and the two e 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.240
 installing the key is the software that already 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.520
 you have installed the drivers in the in 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.680
 the pc ok let's show them the screen 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.629
 of the computer to make it easier 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.189
 as we can see I opened the odin here 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.159
 I have my folder that I told you before 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.349
 this the folder I already opened I said 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.530
 I gave it recognizes me without problems as 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.349
 we can see here this yellow is that already 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.889
 I recognize the table ok now I'm going to 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.480
 click here where it says pda and I look for the 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.830
 rune kay that I have it in the same 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.830
 folder i give to open 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.130
 and what I still have to do is give it to be 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.460
 ok so that I reflect the rumba more to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.460
 to be 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.410
 and as we can see begins begins the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.600
 flashing came 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.820
 as we can see puts here factory and 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.760
 is ironing here because it puts here in 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.860
 I tell them that I've had a 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.830
 little problem and I will comment on it if 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.510
 perhaps it happens to you happens to you the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.330
 same problem turns out that if I 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.550
 I recognized odin the tablet puts me here 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.170
 in yellow but here below me 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.600
 it was until this message was your 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.930
 connection that is what I have done then 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.690
 just unplug the tablet from 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.980
 cable and the normal ignition with the rune 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.350
 previous 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.600
 I opened it and it's a little me 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.860
 what has been detected then what 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.960
 automatic is automatically done 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.270
 windows is to install the drivers again 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.890
 ok once I have installed I have turned off 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.770
 the tablet returned enter mode 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.570
 downloading and this time as you 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.910
 they can be witnesses without problems 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.310
 is ironing the rúa that as we can 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.050
 watch is finishing flashing the rumba 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.490
 just finished moving it 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.920
 run on the tablet 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.300
 and it goes out and here it puts us in the 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.300
 computer as we can see it puts us peace 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.820
 this means that 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.020
 is already up to date I did not unplug the 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.020
 cable until this does not appear 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.230
 and this message comes out ok although all 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.960
 They say that nothing happens I always 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.050
 I leave until until that bar is 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.120
 full of everything ok 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.590
 I imagine that the software is already 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.450
 inside is being updated inside but 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.810
 in case the flies but I already tell you that 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.090
 it's a matter of taste does not cost anything 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.040
 wait we can not see it is already 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.600
 we are getting into it, that is, we are 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.400
 getting the official version this is 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.490

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.490
 arrive 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.610
 as we can see here is the logo of 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.650
 samsung what happens that always every 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.139
 every time we make a delay it took 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.150
 a little bit until I turn on ok like 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.710

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.810
