 hello with you javier tape and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.349
 Now I will tell you how to play call 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.610
 of duty 4 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.389
 it means we have to download first 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 a game from your favorite tracker 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.449
 but if you don't know the idea of ​​downloading then I 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.660
 leave a reference in the description 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.150
 the game version should be 1 out of 7 well link 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.660
 in the description there is game 17 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.559
 but if you have already downloaded the game and do not want 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 and download version 17 again 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.250
 you can also download patches 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.010
 also leave the same below the video 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 so what do we need to do first go 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.640
 in settings and select network settings 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 games and enter the disc key in some he 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.120
 Immediately there but maybe it does not work 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:07.380
 you need to check it only drive 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:11.880
 really if the disk keys are not 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 valid then we need 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.340
 download keygen ssylochku to him I also 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 I will leave in the description, that is, this program 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.000
 which generates a key that you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.210
 you need to enter but for example such 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.250
 push units si kids and you
