thanks for the tutorials packed with

thanks for the tutorials packed with
information<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:19.020> fantastic<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:22.039> decided<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.190> go

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
information is fantastic I decided to go

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.340 
information is fantastic I decided to go
with<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> thin<00:00:24.090> wafer<00:00:24.630> board<00:00:24.900> under

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
with a thin wafer board under

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.720 
with a thin wafer board under
construction<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.460> would<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
construction because it would be a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.429 
construction because it would be a
little<00:00:27.060> stronger<00:00:27.359> than<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.660> using<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> foam

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
little stronger than just using the foam

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
little stronger than just using the foam
we<00:00:31.439> needed<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.769> stronger<00:00:32.250> material<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.090> we

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
we needed a stronger material so we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.239 
we needed a stronger material so we
could<00:00:33.750> support<00:00:34.229> the<00:00:34.409> effigy<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.979> was<00:00:35.100> going

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:35.249 
could support the effigy that was going

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:39.649 
could support the effigy that was going
to<00:00:35.339> be<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.639> top<00:00:35.909> of<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.179> sarcophagus<00:00:38.659> the

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:39.659 
to be on top of the sarcophagus the

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.959 
to be on top of the sarcophagus the
monument<00:00:40.139> is<00:00:40.260> full<00:00:40.620> size<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.339> about<00:00:41.609> six

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
monument is full size it's about six

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.450 
monument is full size it's about six
feet<00:00:42.269> long<00:00:42.569> and<00:00:42.859> probably<00:00:43.859> about<00:00:43.920> four<00:00:44.219> feet

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
feet long and probably about four feet

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:57.500 
feet long and probably about four feet
tall<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.089> effigy

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.600 

using<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> wafer<00:00:58.590> board<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:59.040> allowed<00:00:59.399> us<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
using the wafer board also allowed us to

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.690 
using the wafer board also allowed us to
use<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> thinner<00:01:00.270> foam<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.290> outside<00:01:01.700> and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
use a thinner foam for the outside and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.790 
use a thinner foam for the outside and
glued<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.180> using<00:01:03.570> liquid<00:01:03.989> nails<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
glued it on using liquid nails and I

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.430 
glued it on using liquid nails and I
also<00:01:04.979> had<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> put<00:01:05.370> in<00:01:05.519> corner<00:01:05.940> pieces<00:01:06.440> because

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
also had to put in corner pieces because

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.170 
also had to put in corner pieces because
I<00:01:07.530> miscalculated<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.400> long<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> pieces<00:01:09.000> were

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
I miscalculated how long the pieces were

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.180 
I miscalculated how long the pieces were
supposed<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.619> them<00:01:10.740> glued<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
supposed to be and got them glued and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.320 
supposed to be and got them glued and
taped<00:01:11.369> into<00:01:11.640> place<00:01:13.759> afterwards<00:01:14.759> I<00:01:15.030> did<00:01:15.180> some

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
taped into place afterwards I did some

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
taped into place afterwards I did some
carving<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.140> some<00:01:16.259> sanding<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.550> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
carving and some sanding with I think it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.540 
carving and some sanding with I think it
was<00:01:18.140> 150<00:01:19.140> grit<00:01:19.290> sandpaper<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.009> smoothed<00:01:20.400> out

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
was 150 grit sandpaper and smoothed out

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:30.139 
was 150 grit sandpaper and smoothed out
the<00:01:20.610> edges<00:01:27.170> next<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.500> dribbled<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.700> these

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
the edges next I dribbled out these

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.160 
the edges next I dribbled out these
corner<00:01:30.780> indentations<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.770> oh<00:01:32.899> gosh<00:01:33.899> I<00:01:34.110> think

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
corner indentations with oh gosh I think

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.400 
corner indentations with oh gosh I think
it<00:01:34.440> was<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.920> quarter-inch<00:01:35.930> routing<00:01:36.930> tip

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
it was about a quarter-inch routing tip

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.609 
it was about a quarter-inch routing tip
with<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.860> dremel<00:01:38.210> my<00:01:39.210> wife<00:01:39.390> did<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.810> freehand

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
with a dremel my wife did this freehand

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
with a dremel my wife did this freehand
Celtic<00:01:41.280> knot<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.850> also<00:01:42.030> used<00:01:42.780> with

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
Celtic knot and that was also used with

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.670 
Celtic knot and that was also used with
the<00:01:43.289> quarter<00:01:43.649> inch<00:01:43.680> Dremel<00:01:44.310> routing<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.940> bit

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.600 

I<00:01:50.910> used<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.090> cutting<00:01:52.480> bit<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.310> cracks

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
I used the cutting bit for the cracks

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.850 
I used the cutting bit for the cracks
that<00:01:54.880> are<00:01:55.030> there<00:01:55.180> but<00:01:55.450> I'd<00:01:55.960> probably<00:01:56.260> not<00:01:56.620> use

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
that are there but I'd probably not use

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.700 
that are there but I'd probably not use
that<00:01:57.070> again<00:01:57.510> next<00:01:58.510> time<00:01:58.630> do<00:01:59.260> something<00:01:59.620> like

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
that again next time do something like

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.800 
that again next time do something like
this<00:01:59.890> all<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:00.610> use<00:02:00.820> acetone<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.570> like<00:02:01.750> a

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
this all you just use acetone and like a

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.540 
this all you just use acetone and like a
model<00:02:02.080> paintbrush<00:02:02.560> these<00:02:02.830> just<00:02:03.070> look<00:02:03.250> little

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
model paintbrush these just look little

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.370 
model paintbrush these just look little
too<00:02:03.700> thick<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:04.270> know

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
in the bottom corners here I put a nice

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.940 
in the bottom corners here I put a nice
thick<00:02:33.880> layer<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.480> monster<00:02:35.050> mud<00:02:35.230> down<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.740> hide

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
thick layer of monster mud down to hide

the<00:02:36.160> wood<00:02:36.370> grain<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.450> chipboard<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
the wood grain and the chipboard so you

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.800 
the wood grain and the chipboard so you
don't<00:02:39.610> see<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.030> little<00:02:40.240> ships<00:02:40.570> coming
