almost 3 ounces of paint after its
reduced<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.700> know<00:02:34.940> that's<00:02:35.180> really<00:02:35.300> boring

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
reduced and I know that's really boring

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.140 
reduced and I know that's really boring
stuff<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.410> important<00:02:36.830> thing<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.040> all<00:02:37.819> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
stuff but the important thing is all the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.580 
stuff but the important thing is all the
paint<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.510> make<00:02:38.690> gets<00:02:38.930> put<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> car

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
paint we make gets put on the car

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.340 
paint we make gets put on the car
nothing<00:02:39.830> gets<00:02:40.130> wasted<00:02:40.300> we<00:02:41.300> also<00:02:41.480> use<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> sated

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
nothing gets wasted we also use a sated

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.920 
nothing gets wasted we also use a sated
jet<00:02:42.530> gun<00:02:42.739> with<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> 65-percent<00:02:43.970> transfer<00:02:44.720> rate

jet gun with a 65-percent transfer rate

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.870 
jet gun with a 65-percent transfer rate
that's<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.620> highest<00:02:45.800> transfer<00:02:46.190> rate<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.670> can

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
that's the highest transfer rate you can

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.750 
that's the highest transfer rate you can
get<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.360> means<00:02:47.540> less<00:02:48.250> stuff<00:02:49.250> going<00:02:49.580> into

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
get but that means less stuff going into

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
this we are a lot more environmentally

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.370 
this we are a lot more environmentally
friendly<00:03:10.340> but<00:03:11.269> at<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.720> end<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.019> day<00:03:12.170> we're

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
friendly but at the end of the day we're

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.710
