 up to military bases if you're used to 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.870

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.150
 pure suicide will come running on 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.880
 shot and devour instantly falls

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.730
 zoom 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.780
 character's health z is calculated 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.390
 very cunningly the main blood parameter 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.640
 pressure from blows and bleeding she 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.730
 falls if the hero has decreased pressure 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.370
 There is a chance that another zombie is waving 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.030
 hands will knock you out if pressure 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.500
 fell completely start fainting 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.959
 bleeding can be stopped with bandages

 you can also get some wild boar 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.519
 and fry it on fire most effectively

 restore health packages with 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.769
 donated blood but find them very 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.079
 difficult except fainting and bleeding 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.829
 many other troubles await you

 pistol and shotguns 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.370
 rifle machine guns and machine guns in the near 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.069
 battle and fit a simple fire ax 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.500
 also in price smoke bombs which 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.380
 can distract the ghouls and if you 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.820
 find the card night vision device or 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.150
 kick 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.889
 think that you were just incredibly lucky 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.849
 the main salt yes and z is that player 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.180
 here is death 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:34.030
 sometimes suddenly any unsuccessful death 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.240
 meeting with zombies or flying from a distance 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.970
 head bullet and all after you die 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.669
 You lose all that time to find and those who 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.220
 will search your dead body has a chance quickly 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.250
 get hold of 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.220
 Many players use this than run 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.680
 father is easier to sneak off 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.950
 another character and pick it up thing 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.670
 so the scariest encounters in yes and z 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.310
 This meeting not zombies with people who knows 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.160
 who can a man be in the distance? 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.890
 be a thought fighter zombies and can be 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.350
 gangster last more likely 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.230
 so it 's safer to shoot in that z 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.260
 first and survive here only perfect 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.720
 paranoid wait whoever you stop to shoot 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.720
 I'll be standing shooting 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.430
 team up with other players 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.860
 Such conditions are not easy for a gangster 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.910
 long pretend to be yours and then 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.770
 shoot in the back but the players do n't care 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.780
 sooner or later get in a team 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.960
 because alone survive this 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.880
 a creepy world is too difficult a problem 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.400
 mutual distrust everyone decides 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.669
 in their own way, some are united in a clan and 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.760
 others play only with friends but without 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.830
 mate in yes and z anywhere a friend will bring 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.200
 you out of a swoon will share a jar 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.830
 canned food will help fend off the crowd 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.440
 zombie 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.600
 and a team of friends can be much faster 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.660
 get your own transport 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.790
 what does it make a lonely roadside 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.419
 blackroofs are lying around broken 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.780
 cars 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.680
 bikes motorcycles and even buses them 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.020
 can recover 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.870
 if you find enough spare wheels 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.979
 scrap metal and fuel after that 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.440
 ride with the wind 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.229
 skipping dangerous places to envy 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.729
 less successful players are important 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.729
 don't break the car 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.750
 the hardest to repair and 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.850

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.790
 searching for food under the noses of the walking dead 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.640
