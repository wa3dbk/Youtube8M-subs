danish kroners so it's quite hard to get
the<00:03:44.970> sponsors<00:03:45.390> but<00:03:45.540> there<00:03:45.810> we<00:03:46.350> manage<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.890> we

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
the sponsors but there we manage and we

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.680 
the sponsors but there we manage and we
got<00:03:47.430> something<00:03:47.880> really<00:03:48.060> good<00:03:48.270> out<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.600> i

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
got something really good out of it i

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.750 
got something really good out of it i
think<00:03:48.750> we<00:03:49.290> thought<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:49.890> was<00:03:50.040> very<00:03:50.550> very

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
think we thought that it was very very

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.810 
think we thought that it was very very
important<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.690> had<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.990> be<00:03:52.020> free<00:03:52.380> right

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
important that it had to be free right

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.660 
important that it had to be free right
so<00:03:53.820> people<00:03:54.330> don't<00:03:54.540> have<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.900> buy<00:03:55.230> or<00:03:56.160> at

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
so people don't have to buy or at

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.360 
so people don't have to buy or at
circuit<00:03:57.120> or<00:03:57.300> have<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.960> pay<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.170> come<00:03:58.440> inside<00:03:58.800> so

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
circuit or have to pay to come inside so

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.070 
circuit or have to pay to come inside so
they<00:03:59.520> can<00:03:59.670> feel<00:03:59.850> free<00:03:59.880> because<00:04:00.210> that's<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
they can feel free because that's the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.470 
they can feel free because that's the
philosophy<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.710> pakua<00:04:02.100> right<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:03.210> don't<00:04:03.300> have

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
philosophy of pakua right you don't have

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.080 
philosophy of pakua right you don't have

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
to pay to Tupac woods so I thought it

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.030 
to pay to Tupac woods so I thought it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
was it will be a shame to make people

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.560
