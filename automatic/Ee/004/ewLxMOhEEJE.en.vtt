00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
flickr group and this week I thought I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.070 
flickr group and this week I thought I
would<00:00:17.720> talk<00:00:17.930> about<00:00:18.160> joy<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.610> great<00:00:20.080> emotion

would talk about joy that great emotion
called<00:00:21.350> joy<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:22.910> was<00:00:23.029> taking<00:00:23.300> a<00:00:23.330> look<00:00:23.480> at<00:00:23.689> a

couple<00:00:24.020> of<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.320> photographs<00:00:24.860> that<00:00:25.010> exhibited

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.150 
couple of the photographs that exhibited
that<00:00:25.939> emotion<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:26.720> thought<00:00:26.930> wow<00:00:27.200> that

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
that emotion and I thought wow that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.830

emotion<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.350> as<00:00:39.350> I<00:00:39.559> looked<00:00:39.800> at<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:39.980> flickr

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250
