00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
in a normal car then I can change to a
fuel<00:01:30.479> consumption<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.229> range<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.930> gives

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
fuel consumption and range this gives

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
fuel consumption and range this gives
you<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> fuel<00:01:34.860> consumption<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> left

range on the right then there's also

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.219 
range on the right then there's also
efficiency<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:47.340> gives<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.170> sort<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
efficiency this gives you a sort of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.660 
efficiency this gives you a sort of
efficiency<00:01:49.979> ohmmeter

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
efficiency ohmmeter

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270
