00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
really like this arrangement that we've

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.380 
really like this arrangement that we've
taken<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.809> made<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:35.040> unit<00:00:35.850> itself<00:00:36.149> is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
taken it made because the unit itself is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.850 
taken it made because the unit itself is
fairly<00:00:36.750> heavy<00:00:36.960> especially<00:00:37.230> once<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> add<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
fairly heavy especially once you add a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.220 
fairly heavy especially once you add a
very<00:00:38.370> heavy<00:00:38.579> camera<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.809> using<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
very heavy camera to it but using the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.020 
very heavy camera to it but using the
GoPro<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> makes<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> kind<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.520> fun<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
GoPro with it makes it kind of fun and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.479 
GoPro with it makes it kind of fun and
very<00:00:42.989> light<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.440> interesting<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> course

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
very light and interesting and of course

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
very light and interesting and of course
you<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:45.270> great<00:00:45.539> videos<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
you can make great videos with the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.319 
you can make great videos with the
glidecam<00:00:47.219> HT<00:00:47.670> mm<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.440> km/h<00:00:49.860> 2<00:00:50.070> mm<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
glidecam HT mm so do I km/h 2 mm it is a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.180 
glidecam HT mm so do I km/h 2 mm it is a
great<00:00:51.629> stabilizer<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.440> has<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> gimbal

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
great stabilizer that has a gimbal

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
great stabilizer that has a gimbal
that's<00:00:53.399> inside<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that's inside of it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
that's inside of it
that<00:00:54.510> makes<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.140> basically<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.010> can

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that makes it so that basically you can

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.729 
that makes it so that basically you can
balance<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> 3<00:00:58.350> axis

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
balance it out and with the 3 axis

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
balance it out and with the 3 axis
gimbal<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.640> take<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.059> amount<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
gimbal you can take an amount for a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.799 
gimbal you can take an amount for a
great<00:01:01.020> precision<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.210> great<00:01:03.210> video<00:01:03.510> where

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the glide cam we're still getting it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.330 
the glide cam we're still getting it
down<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.560> still<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.009> think<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.250> little

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
down so we still have I think a little

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
down so we still have I think a little
bit<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.640> shaking<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.270> bit<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:46.049> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
bit of shaking or a little bit but you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
bit of shaking or a little bit but you
can<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> spins<00:01:47.759> very<00:01:47.880> nicely<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
can see here it spins very nicely and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.580
