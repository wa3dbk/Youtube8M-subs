00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
its nearing the end of februari it's

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.710 
its nearing the end of februari it's
interesting<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.970> we've<00:00:06.210> still<00:00:06.390> got<00:00:06.510> a<00:00:06.540> fire

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
interesting that we've still got a fire

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.900 
interesting that we've still got a fire
season<00:00:07.170> here<00:00:07.439> the<00:00:08.069> days<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.519> getting<00:00:08.730> shorter

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
season here the days are getting shorter

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.090 
season here the days are getting shorter
and<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.780> weather<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.170> starting<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.830> change

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
and the weather is starting to change

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.560 
and the weather is starting to change
but<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.550> still<00:00:11.700> got<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:11.880> fire<00:00:12.120> season<00:00:12.450> that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
but we still got a fire season that

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.720 
but we still got a fire season that
people<00:00:12.840> need<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:12.990> be<00:00:13.140> conscious<00:00:13.350> about<00:00:13.730> it's

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
people need to be conscious about it's

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.250 
people need to be conscious about it's
interesting<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:15.270> the<00:00:15.330> days<00:00:15.600> being<00:00:15.870> shorter

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
interesting with the days being shorter

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.590 
interesting with the days being shorter
we're<00:00:16.890> seeing<00:00:17.189> a<00:00:17.369> slightly<00:00:17.850> different<00:00:18.150> change

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
we're seeing a slightly different change

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.330 
we're seeing a slightly different change
in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> weather<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.440> think<00:00:19.680> over<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.860> weekend

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
in the weather I think over the weekend

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.240 
in the weather I think over the weekend
we've<00:00:20.520> seen<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.060> slightly<00:00:21.810> cooler<00:00:22.250> shorter

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
we've seen that slightly cooler shorter

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.620 
we've seen that slightly cooler shorter
days<00:00:23.460> meant<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> little<00:00:23.940> bit<00:00:24.030> more<00:00:24.210> moisture

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
days meant a little bit more moisture

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.380 
days meant a little bit more moisture
around<00:00:24.690> and<00:00:25.100> we<00:00:26.100> certainly<00:00:26.310> welcome<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.760> but

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
around and we certainly welcome that but

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
around and we certainly welcome that but
we<00:00:27.480> haven't<00:00:27.630> seen<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> change<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.470> any<00:00:28.710> way

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
we haven't seen the change in any way

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
we haven't seen the change in any way
with<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> fuel<00:00:29.610> conditions<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.180> means<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
with the fuel conditions that means that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
with the fuel conditions that means that
we've<00:00:30.810> still<00:00:30.960> got<00:00:31.110> dry<00:00:31.380> grass<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.070> Bush<00:00:32.340> land

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
we've still got dry grass and Bush land

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
we've still got dry grass and Bush land
across<00:00:33.059> Victoria<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.840> that's<00:00:34.379> the<00:00:34.530> key

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
across Victoria and that's the key

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.850 
across Victoria and that's the key
factor<00:00:35.160> at<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.310> moment<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.480> week<00:00:36.750> we'll<00:00:37.590> see

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
factor at the moment this week we'll see

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
factor at the moment this week we'll see
a<00:00:38.160> cooler<00:00:39.060> week<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.630> more<00:00:40.110> mild<00:00:40.290> week<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
a cooler week a more mild week and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.380 
a cooler week a more mild week and
potential<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.430> lightning<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:41.940> early<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
potential of lightning and early in the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
potential of lightning and early in the
week<00:00:42.540> which<00:00:42.780> means<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.230> could<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.530> other

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
week which means we could have other

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.580 
week which means we could have other
starts<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> fire<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.690> also<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
starts a fire but also we're going to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
starts a fire but also we're going to
see<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> potential<00:00:47.130> for<00:00:47.340> showers<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.700> rain

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
see the potential for showers and rain

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
see the potential for showers and rain
and<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.329> certainly<00:00:48.510> welcome<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> word<00:00:49.530> about

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and we certainly welcome the word about

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
and we certainly welcome the word about
rain<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.579> get<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.540> change

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
rain and if we get that that will change

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.440 
rain and if we get that that will change
the<00:00:52.500> landscape<00:00:52.710> dramatically<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.790> we<00:00:54.329> can

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
the landscape dramatically and we can

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.150 
the landscape dramatically and we can
only<00:00:54.510> hope<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.140> widespread<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:56.040> that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
only hope that it's widespread but that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.040 
only hope that it's widespread but that
may<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.790> case<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.300> stay<00:00:57.600> tuned<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
may not be the case so stay tuned to the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110 
may not be the case so stay tuned to the
forecast<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> bureau<00:00:59.579> will<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.879> its<00:01:00.059> best

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
forecast and the bureau will do its best

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
forecast and the bureau will do its best
to<00:01:00.450> make<00:01:00.809> sure<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> weather<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to make sure we get the weather that is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.639 
to make sure we get the weather that is
best<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.640> us<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.870> other<00:01:04.019> thing<00:01:04.199> though<00:01:04.379> it's

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
best for us the other thing though it's

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.170 
best for us the other thing though it's
interesting<00:01:04.829> to<00:01:05.129> reflect<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.640> last<00:01:05.939> week

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

around the urban fringe or what we call
the<00:01:29.100> urban-rural<00:01:29.670> interface<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.540> something

the urban-rural interface is something

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.350 
the urban-rural interface is something

interface<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.450> them<00:01:39.630> well<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:39.840> we

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
interface we know them well but we

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.510 
interface we know them well but we
actually<00:01:40.170> went<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> look<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> lot<00:01:41.340> more

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
actually went have a look at a lot more

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.039 
actually went have a look at a lot more
information<00:01:41.759> about<00:01:42.150> where<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> schools<00:01:42.840> are

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
information about where the schools are

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.170 
information about where the schools are
the<00:01:43.740> childcare<00:01:44.159> facilities<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.939> we're<00:01:45.030> going

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the childcare facilities and we're going

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.170 
the childcare facilities and we're going
to<00:01:45.240> make<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.780> focus<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:47.180> fire

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to make a really focus if we have a fire

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
to make a really focus if we have a fire
in<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.450> area<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.110> any<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> those<00:01:49.650> areas<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
in that area in any of those areas in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
in that area in any of those areas in
the<00:01:50.820> next<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.150> weeks<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:52.049> do

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the next two weeks that we really do

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
the next two weeks that we really do
tune<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.770> lot<00:01:53.040> closer<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> schools<00:01:54.030> because

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
tune a lot closer to the schools because

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.429 
tune a lot closer to the schools because
I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:54.960> where<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> lot<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
I think that's where a lot of the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560 
I think that's where a lot of the
concern<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.610> you're<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> parent<00:01:57.060> you'd<00:01:57.479> be

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
concern was if you're a parent you'd be

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.359 
concern was if you're a parent you'd be
looking<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> kids<00:01:58.350> are<00:01:58.439> doing<00:01:58.500> if

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
looking for what the kids are doing if

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.920 
looking for what the kids are doing if
it's<00:01:59.549> after<00:01:59.700> three-thirty<00:02:00.329> where<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.720> kids

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it's after three-thirty where the kids

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.569 
it's after three-thirty where the kids
are<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.220> one<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> things

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
are and I think that's one of the things

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
are and I think that's one of the things
that<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.600> certainly<00:02:03.930> focused<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.409> last

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
that that we certainly focused on last

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.280 
that that we certainly focused on last
week<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:06.090> someone<00:02:06.720> that's<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.110> there

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
week to you as someone that's out there

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.440 
week to you as someone that's out there
whether<00:02:07.710> you're<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> schoolchild<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.849> whether

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
whether you're a schoolchild or whether

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
whether you're a schoolchild or whether
your<00:02:09.569> apparent<00:02:10.019> think<00:02:10.829> about<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.219> school

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
your apparent think about the school

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.190 
your apparent think about the school
hours<00:02:11.849> think<00:02:12.269> about<00:02:12.419> what<00:02:12.599> happens<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.079> those

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
hours think about what happens for those

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.049 
hours think about what happens for those
two<00:02:13.409> or<00:02:13.529> three<00:02:13.739> hours<00:02:13.769> after<00:02:14.219> school<00:02:14.609> finishes

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:15.059 
two or three hours after school finishes

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.430 
two or three hours after school finishes
people<00:02:15.749> are<00:02:15.809> on<00:02:15.870> public

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
people are on public

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.170 
people are on public
sport<00:02:16.650> where<00:02:16.890> are<00:02:17.490> they<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:17.760> would<00:02:17.910> they<00:02:18.060> do

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
sport where are they what would they do

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.910 
sport where are they what would they do
a<00:02:18.210> fire<00:02:18.630> started<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.410> would<00:02:19.560> they<00:02:19.680> do<00:02:19.740> if

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
a fire started what would they do if

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.170 
a fire started what would they do if
they<00:02:20.010> couldn't<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.370> home<00:02:20.580> because<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.000> bus

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
they couldn't get home because the bus

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030 
they couldn't get home because the bus
didn't<00:02:21.450> make<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.660> other<00:02:21.870> trained<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.950> as

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
didn't make it other trained in so as

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.170 
didn't make it other trained in so as
lots<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.340> things<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.700> about<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.120> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
lots of things to think about and I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.880 
lots of things to think about and I
think<00:02:24.210> that's<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.690> action<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.080> week<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
think that's the action this week is to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.920 
think that's the action this week is to
think<00:02:26.310> about<00:02:26.520> what<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.850> means<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.210> be<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.450> person

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
think about what it means to be a person

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.620 
think about what it means to be a person
that<00:02:27.960> lives<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.410> urban<00:02:29.150> urban<00:02:30.150> areas<00:02:30.450> whether

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
that lives in urban urban areas whether

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.030 
that lives in urban urban areas whether
it<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:30.900> Melbourne<00:02:31.290> or<00:02:31.440> some<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.920> our

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it be in Melbourne or some of our

it be in Melbourne or some of our
provincial<00:02:32.340> cities<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.570> fire<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:34.020> near<00:02:34.200> you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
provincial cities if a fire was near you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.170 
provincial cities if a fire was near you
and<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.010> close<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> your<00:02:35.700> home<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:48.300 
and it's close to your home that you
don't<00:02:36.510> normally<00:02:36.720> think<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.530> would<00:02:37.770> be

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.920 

you
