00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 hey john you know what a cool sonic 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.700
 level would be what the hermes of such a hey 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.260
 what the nefarious asshole zone in the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.789
 level is about sonic shrinking 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.800
 and in the guts of somebody 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 running around think it is restored could 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 robo tapeworms and shit on something like that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.630
 I do not want to hear 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.029
 why is not that such a good one? 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.199
 Idea is so stupid 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.520
 I think I write sonic team that 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.539
 now in the next game should take 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.219
 you certainly have better ideas 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.739
 Did you hear that you have the current 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.050
 play games but also true 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.710
 but still this idea is aldi the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.879
 open gold apologies have sent 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 one I told you that you the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.960
 i should hate it if that fails 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 So somebody does that I was pretty much then 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 again okay we see you as I would have 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.589
 I'd say yes, it's here for me 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.839
 falka videos for doing this sorry 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.190
 ok further in the text the nefarious 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.780
 Schlauchturm could look like that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.100
 Sonic suddenly comes across with 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 great speed in search of a klo 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.430
 is and with time limit you have to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.200
 find a toilet as soon as possible 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 he says to himself and look like you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.009
 I think about something stupid after John 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.649
 I know if I never have a good idea 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.939
 good ideas US movies you just like it 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.450
 because that is pure it is not true 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.079

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.079
