00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello my dear guests 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.090
 channel today I want to show you how to 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:17.919
 man tga cars 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:24.039
 2008, the test is held 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:24.039
 compression pressure squeeze using 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 computer dealer man cats engine 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.460
 32876 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:44.670
 common rail euro 3 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.710
 engine only after repair we want 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.180
 check what he has at the moment 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.170
 indicators let's see go in 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.170
 menu diagnostics 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 engine 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.570
 blocks and dc 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.880
 so not a single memory is fixed 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.340
 errors all the errors we have already removed that 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 were 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.619
 choose the menu item monitoring 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:30.450
 let's first see what's the principle 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 What parameters are we moving now? 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.930
 boost pressure oil pressure 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.509
 fuel pressure before the filter 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.720
 actual fuel pressure 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:46.679
 setpoint pressure fuel 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.539
 fuel and output parameter you 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.149
 main pressure now we have everything 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.179
 fine everything is fine i mean parameters 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:00.270
 for new 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:02.700
 in fact the new engine though 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.360
 we'll see 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 what do we have 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.860
 This injection on cylinders here, too, all 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 very smooth 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.590
 very good jack tara same after 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.590
 repair 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.340
 exit this menu 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.050
 here 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.090
 such 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.090
 item compression testing go 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.200
 instructions here he is to us 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.200
 shows how to 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.770
 use those measurements 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.890
 which we get 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:57.640
 advice gives minimum requirements 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.240
 which is necessary for this to spend 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.240
 this test 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.040
 here describes the procedure itself 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.040
 compression test 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:26.860
 we stop the engine we turn on 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:29.280
 ignition we press the enter button we rotate 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.280
 starter 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.540
 the engine at this time is accordingly not 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:41.260
 it starts and now let's look at 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:45.450
 the results that we have all 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.950
 fit within here 1 2 units 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:54.820
 it's very good all the cylinders in 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:00.460
 excellent condition these finish this 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:02.430
 test very ignition turn on again 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.110
 ignition 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:12.300
 engine overclocking test next 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.300
 the next test can start the engine 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.880
 and 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.440
 let's start the test 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.550
 here is a brief description of the explanation now 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.370
 never mind 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.050
 now the engines run on all six 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.360
 cylinders 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.870
 in turn will turn off as given 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.470
 case 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.470
 cylinders 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:50.030
 are disconnected sequentially 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.030
 engine family 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.800
 our test continues 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.190
 that's what we see 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.950
 well here we see the first cylinder 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.950
 slight deviation but it is still related 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.540
 so that firstly you idiot piston 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.070
 we have just been replaced by an account 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:26.760
 ground mirror ring cylinders 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:30.240
 it is now some of these indicators 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.870
 what was the future mark of methyl 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.870
 video 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:42.720
 put likes subscribe to my channel 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.410
 thank you all very much 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.410
 see you soon
