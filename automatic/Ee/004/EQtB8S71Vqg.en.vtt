 liquid tournament of fall reaches us in the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.630
 spring so what I'm seeing is 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.040
 international the tournament is to say that 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.050
 everyone can play so many beings 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.550
 from america europe asia from wherever 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.080
 you can play but what part of the world 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.239
 with any version of the good game 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.620
 black and white I guess it will be but 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.690
 I want to say that the one the region of 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 game 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.059
 there tells us that the registration period 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 will begin on May 9 and will end on 16 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 that is to say that there is no May and if you want 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.750

 and that I registered until 16 of 20 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 time and from what I see that tournament 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 although it 's weird is going to be single that is 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.950
