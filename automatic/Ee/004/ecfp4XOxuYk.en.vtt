 come to your guardian and number four d south is and what 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.800
 in which we continue 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.930
 I got married the last time 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.479
 thesis let's go to 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:13.719
 butt and we were going to simple the previous duration against 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.650
 to modify the view in application 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.859
 we hope you will have done missions 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560
 and once opened 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.380
 you know that I change the black background 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.659
 it may be like a mania but 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.529
 I'm comfortable with her 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.009
 anyway 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.409
 let's go to europe 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 drag the two text fields 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.379
 in which the user goes 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.730
 amite 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.730
 the clement numbers are not that they are so big 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750
 i 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.890
 let's put it live 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.040
 here 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.040
 what I'm gonna say 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.130
 and we are going to put on live that is going to have the answer 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.780
 mons 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.110
 supplies a little bit 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.250
 10 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.780
 now no no 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.150
 I'm not going to put a sign here because I have several signs 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 that are going to be the buttons everyone called the buttons 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.850
 the button 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 sum 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 the crest button 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.250
 the button 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.690
 multiplication 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.180
 and the button 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.030
 division 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.450
 The time 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.070
 we want the user 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.730
 can put numbers 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.870
 and not only tex then 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.650
 we are going to go we are going to select the fields 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.110
 I detest impotent and turn 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.230
 I'm going to name it peace 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.260
 ivan lendl another mistake I'm going to eat no brand 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.490
 parkes when the use of assets or show or motta 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.039
 well we already have the costs on the screen then now we are going to liquidate 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:18.069
 the athletes as we did to smash clay harbored the problem said 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.659
 that all control click and dragged it said indifferent which is which 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.119
 really and fucking I love in points 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.119
 Attempts 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.759
 Emilio 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.769
 now here 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.449
 I asked a sketch to specify to me 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.809
 to the micro the mac that action will carry out the vote because there were many 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.489
 tonces here until chapín sáez without control drá 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.309
 here and this laser sum 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:49.439
 or the selection where it remains 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.439
 Billet caliper etc 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.569
 i division edition 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.999
 Billet is 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.279
 division 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.279
 come back from multiplication 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.479
 in fact the pib sae 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.049
 bolt 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.159
 itunes and that this could save 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.719
 as before closing my invincible dv thesis 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.980
 the application works 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.980
 efe 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.529
 let's wait for the miter station of pérez to load the abolition either 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.529
 good berec is this things look 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.609
 let's see if it works we hold 23 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.429
 points 6 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.999
 we punished 15 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:42.999
 the 15 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.279
 looks good 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.529
 percent this was a tutorial on how to make a simple calculator 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.579
 percent I hope has helped them have a better view of how 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.529
 copy 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.399
 the information that puts the user transform it Augustin operate revolver 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.089
 I spit on the screen 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:08.579
 this is just the beginning in this in the inter that if we are going to see a little more 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.869
 of user interfaces as well 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.549
 the titles and piqued this cap controls 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.799
 but it's going to get better this is just the beginning you should not subscribe 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.349
 Thank you
