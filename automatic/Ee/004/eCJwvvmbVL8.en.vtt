that<00:02:44.800> on<00:02:44.920> Gerber<00:02:45.370> site<00:02:45.700> they<00:02:46.540> simply<00:02:46.960> call<00:02:47.170> it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
that on Gerber site they simply call it

that<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.400> mystery<00:02:51.880> steel<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:53.170> really

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
that is mystery steel and it really

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.160 
that is mystery steel and it really
looks<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.400> me<00:02:54.520> like<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.820> is<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> 440<00:02:55.720> variant

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
looks to me like this is a 440 variant

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.300 
looks to me like this is a 440 variant
maybe<00:02:56.770> 440c<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:58.960> no<00:02:59.200> idea<00:02:59.710> what<00:03:00.160> kind

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
maybe 440c and I have no idea what kind

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.890 
maybe 440c and I have no idea what kind
of<00:03:00.430> edge<00:03:00.550> retention<00:03:00.910> it's<00:03:01.420> going<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.720> have

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
of edge retention it's going to have

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.080 
of edge retention it's going to have
i've<00:03:02.500> used<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.950> knife<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.280> couple<00:03:03.550> times<00:03:03.730> for

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
i've used this knife a couple times for

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.890 
i've used this knife a couple times for
very<00:03:04.450> light<00:03:04.720> tasks<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.610> i<00:03:06.610> really<00:03:07.000> don't<00:03:07.780> have

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
very light tasks and i really don't have

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.360 
very light tasks and i really don't have
enough<00:03:08.080> experience<00:03:08.230> with<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.040> tell<00:03:09.220> you

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
enough experience with it to tell you

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.160 
enough experience with it to tell you
how<00:03:09.520> good<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.850> edge<00:03:09.970> retention<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.600> but<00:03:11.140> i

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
how good the edge retention is but i

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.990 
how good the edge retention is but i
suspect<00:03:11.650> it's<00:03:11.860> not<00:03:12.100> going<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.400> be<00:03:12.490> very<00:03:12.520> good

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
suspect it's not going to be very good

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.240 
suspect it's not going to be very good
if<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:14.110> want<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.410> do<00:03:14.530> some<00:03:14.830> very<00:03:14.950> light<00:03:15.190> but

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
if you want to do some very light but

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.000 
if you want to do some very light but
taunting<00:03:15.820> with<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.120> knife<00:03:16.300> i<00:03:16.690> do<00:03:17.500> think<00:03:17.920> it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
taunting with this knife i do think it

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.680 
taunting with this knife i do think it
has<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.160> thick<00:03:18.459> enough<00:03:18.670> spine<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.390> it's<00:03:19.540> going

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
has a thick enough spine that it's going

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.140 
has a thick enough spine that it's going
to<00:03:19.750> absorb<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.170> shock<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:21.400> i<00:03:21.760> think<00:03:22.060> you're

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
to absorb the shock but i think you're

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.520 
to absorb the shock but i think you're
going<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.330> dull<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.780> edge<00:03:22.930> very<00:03:23.260> very

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
going to dull that edge very very

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.260 
going to dull that edge very very
quickly<00:03:23.830> but<00:03:24.550> i'm<00:03:24.670> going<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.850> talk<00:03:24.970> about<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
quickly but i'm going to talk about the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.540 
quickly but i'm going to talk about the
blade<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.690> them<00:03:25.810> in<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.140> second<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:26.980> really<00:03:27.430> the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
blade in them in a second so really the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.510 
blade in them in a second so really the
second<00:03:27.970> short<00:03:28.209> coming<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.020> steel<00:03:29.520> the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
second short coming is the steel the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.160 
second short coming is the steel the
third<00:03:30.790> short<00:03:31.180> coming<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.630> knife<00:03:31.870> is

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
third short coming of the knife is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.100 
third short coming of the knife is
really<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.130> handle<00:03:33.580> I<00:03:33.760> don't<00:03:34.720> think<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.050> is

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
really the handle I don't think this is

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.770 
really the handle I don't think this is
a<00:03:35.170> good<00:03:35.290> handle<00:03:35.680> design<00:03:36.040> at<00:03:36.280> all<00:03:36.630> number<00:03:37.630> one

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
a good handle design at all number one

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.800 
a good handle design at all number one
problem<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.500> handle<00:03:38.890> slabs<00:03:39.250> are<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:40.390> slick

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
problem the handle slabs are this slick

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.380 
problem the handle slabs are this slick
would<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.880> that's<00:03:43.030> going<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.269> be<00:03:43.360> a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
would I think that's going to be a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.020 
would I think that's going to be a
problem<00:03:43.660> because<00:03:44.190> it's<00:03:45.190> probably<00:03:45.670> not<00:03:45.880> going

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
problem because it's probably not going

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.479 
problem because it's probably not going
to<00:03:46.090> be<00:03:46.180> very<00:03:46.209> durable<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:47.340> despite<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
to be very durable and despite the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.250 
to be very durable and despite the
finish<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.180> don't<00:03:49.510> know<00:03:49.630> how<00:03:49.930> weather

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
finish I don't know how weather

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.990 
finish I don't know how weather
resistant<00:03:50.920> those<00:03:51.100> wooden<00:03:51.370> slabs<00:03:51.730> are<00:03:51.880> going

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
resistant those wooden slabs are going

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.020 
resistant those wooden slabs are going
to<00:03:52.060> be<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.920> think<00:03:53.920> they're<00:03:54.130> probably<00:03:54.430> fairly

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
to be I think they're probably fairly

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.430 
to be I think they're probably fairly
low<00:03:55.300> quality<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.620> can<00:03:57.100> remove<00:03:57.370> them<00:03:57.810> with<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
low quality now I can remove them with a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.940 
low quality now I can remove them with a
hex<00:04:00.370> wrench<00:04:00.670> or<00:04:00.910> rain<00:04:01.150> allen<00:04:01.870> key<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.260> put<00:04:02.830> my

hex wrench or rain allen key and put my

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.490 
hex wrench or rain allen key and put my
own<00:04:03.130> slabs<00:04:03.489> on<00:04:03.730> there<00:04:03.970> but<00:04:04.540> as<00:04:04.750> they<00:04:05.019> come<00:04:05.290> I

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
own slabs on there but as they come I

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.530 
own slabs on there but as they come I
don't<00:04:05.830> think<00:04:05.920> they're<00:04:06.130> very<00:04:06.160> good<00:04:06.549> in

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
don't think they're very good in

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.410 
don't think they're very good in
addition<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.440> not<00:04:09.070> having<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.519> lot<00:04:09.610> of<00:04:09.670> grip<00:04:10.090> I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
addition to not having a lot of grip I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.930 
addition to not having a lot of grip I
do<00:04:10.630> have<00:04:11.170> grip<00:04:11.470> because<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:12.070> this<00:04:12.280> extensive

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940

nice<00:06:01.150> sweep<00:06:01.570> and<00:06:01.870> a<00:06:02.050> lot<00:06:02.229> of<00:06:02.349> belly<00:06:02.500> it's<00:06:03.250> not<00:06:03.460> a

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
nice sweep and a lot of belly it's not a

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.490 
nice sweep and a lot of belly it's not a
full<00:06:03.759> flat<00:06:04.060> grind<00:06:04.419> it<00:06:04.690> does<00:06:04.870> have<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> bevel

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
full flat grind it does have a bevel

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.020 
full flat grind it does have a bevel
about<00:06:05.740> half<00:06:05.949> an<00:06:06.099> inch<00:06:06.190> down<00:06:06.430> from<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.789> spine

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
about half an inch down from the spine

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.959 
about half an inch down from the spine
but<00:06:08.020> i<00:06:08.500> am<00:06:08.650> going<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.830> be<00:06:08.949> able<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.250> put<00:06:09.430> a<00:06:09.669> very

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
but i am going to be able to put a very

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.180 
but i am going to be able to put a very
acute<00:06:10.389> edge<00:06:10.659> on<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.259> because<00:06:11.500> i<00:06:11.710> think<00:06:11.770> it

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
acute edge on it and because i think it

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.209 
acute edge on it and because i think it
is<00:06:12.340> probably<00:06:12.669> a<00:06:12.880> 440<00:06:13.539> i<00:06:13.690> can<00:06:14.620> get<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:14.889> very<00:06:15.159> good

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
is probably a 440 i can get a very good

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:16.620 
is probably a 440 i can get a very good
edge<00:06:15.460> on<00:06:15.669> it<00:06:15.729> i<00:06:15.940> don't<00:06:16.150> know<00:06:16.240> if<00:06:16.270> it's<00:06:16.449> going<00:06:16.539> to

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
edge on it i don't know if it's going to

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.120 
edge on it i don't know if it's going to
hold<00:06:16.810> it<00:06:16.990> but<00:06:17.349> I<00:06:17.380> can<00:06:17.469> certainly<00:06:17.770> make<00:06:18.070> it

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
hold it but I can certainly make it

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.909 
hold it but I can certainly make it
sharp<00:06:18.520> in<00:06:19.080> addition<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.710> knife<00:06:20.919> does<00:06:21.340> have<00:06:21.699> a

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
sharp in addition the knife does have a

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.850 
sharp in addition the knife does have a
decent<00:06:23.919> spine<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.639> it<00:06:24.759> so<00:06:25.389> it<00:06:26.169> is<00:06:26.560> going<00:06:26.770> to<00:06:26.830> be

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
decent spine to it so it is going to be

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.999 
decent spine to it so it is going to be
fairly<00:06:27.159> strong<00:06:28.050> throughout<00:06:29.050> that<00:06:29.380> blade<00:06:29.710> I

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
fairly strong throughout that blade I

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.330 
fairly strong throughout that blade I
also<00:06:30.280> like<00:06:30.729> the<00:06:30.940> blade<00:06:31.150> length<00:06:31.650> because<00:06:32.650> it

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
also like the blade length because it

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.520 
also like the blade length because it
keeps<00:06:33.669> the<00:06:33.940> night<00:06:34.090> very<00:06:34.449> nimble<00:06:34.719> it's<00:06:35.199> very

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
keeps the night very nimble it's very

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.420 
keeps the night very nimble it's very
lightweight<00:06:36.120> yet<00:06:37.120> has<00:06:37.570> a<00:06:37.599> lot<00:06:37.870> of<00:06:37.900> utility

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
lightweight yet has a lot of utility

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.409 
lightweight yet has a lot of utility
especially<00:06:39.430> in<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.639> latter<00:06:39.849> third<00:06:40.210> of<00:06:40.330> the

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
especially in the latter third of the

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.990 
especially in the latter third of the
blade<00:06:40.630> because<00:06:41.320> it's<00:06:41.770> a<00:06:41.949> short<00:06:42.039> blade<00:06:42.669> and

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
blade because it's a short blade and

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.360 
blade because it's a short blade and
very<00:06:43.330> lightweight<00:06:43.599> and<00:06:44.110> it<00:06:44.740> has<00:06:44.949> that<00:06:45.190> great

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
very lightweight and it has that great

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.060 
very lightweight and it has that great
jimping<00:06:45.940> and<00:06:46.150> these<00:06:46.840> finger<00:06:47.229> grooves<00:06:47.500> I<00:06:47.770> have

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
jimping and these finger grooves I have

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.980 
jimping and these finger grooves I have
a<00:06:48.130> lot<00:06:48.400> of<00:06:48.430> positive<00:06:49.090> control<00:06:49.509> especially

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
a lot of positive control especially

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.790 
a lot of positive control especially
when<00:06:50.800> I'm<00:06:50.919> doing<00:06:51.090> slicing<00:06:52.090> tasks<00:06:52.560> so<00:06:53.560> for<00:06:53.710> that

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
when I'm doing slicing tasks so for that

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.469 
when I'm doing slicing tasks so for that
reason<00:06:53.860> I<00:06:54.219> really<00:06:54.460> do<00:06:54.759> like<00:06:54.940> the<00:06:55.060> blade<00:06:55.270> design

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
reason I really do like the blade design

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.540 
reason I really do like the blade design
and<00:06:55.840> if<00:06:56.229> you<00:06:56.349> look<00:06:56.560> at<00:06:56.710> some<00:06:56.860> more<00:06:56.889> expensive

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
and if you look at some more expensive

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.450 
and if you look at some more expensive
knives<00:06:57.789> they<00:06:58.750> have<00:06:59.080> very<00:07:00.039> similar<00:07:00.310> designs

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
knives they have very similar designs

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.490 
knives they have very similar designs
I<00:07:01.520> think<00:07:02.000> the<00:07:02.180> reason<00:07:02.389> why<00:07:02.720> this<00:07:02.780> knife<00:07:03.169> kind

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
I think the reason why this knife kind

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.320 
I think the reason why this knife kind
of<00:07:03.620> suffers<00:07:04.039> and<00:07:04.340> why<00:07:04.490> I<00:07:04.520> can't<00:07:04.910> give<00:07:05.090> it<00:07:05.180> such

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
of suffers and why I can't give it such

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.790 
of suffers and why I can't give it such
a<00:07:05.360> great<00:07:06.310> score<00:07:07.310> is<00:07:07.960> because<00:07:08.960> of<00:07:09.080> the<00:07:09.169> poor

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 
a great score is because of the poor

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.100 
a great score is because of the poor
materials<00:07:10.430> and<00:07:10.669> kind<00:07:10.849> of<00:07:10.940> poor<00:07:11.180> execution<00:07:11.630> on

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
materials and kind of poor execution on

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.529 
materials and kind of poor execution on
the<00:07:12.229> idea<00:07:12.590> while<00:07:13.310> the<00:07:13.460> design<00:07:13.819> is<00:07:14.060> good<00:07:14.300> I

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
the idea while the design is good I

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.420 
the idea while the design is good I
think<00:07:14.810> the<00:07:14.930> handle<00:07:15.440> is<00:07:15.650> going<00:07:15.919> to<00:07:15.979> be<00:07:16.069> very

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
think the handle is going to be very

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.300 
think the handle is going to be very
uncomfortable<00:07:16.849> I<00:07:17.360> think<00:07:18.199> the<00:07:18.319> blade<00:07:18.530> steel<00:07:18.949> is

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
uncomfortable I think the blade steel is

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.689 
uncomfortable I think the blade steel is
probably<00:07:20.120> a<00:07:20.780> mediocre<00:07:21.410> steel<00:07:21.889> at<00:07:22.099> best<00:07:22.370> and

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:22.699 
probably a mediocre steel at best and

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:26.309 
probably a mediocre steel at best and
the<00:07:23.330> sheath<00:07:23.599> is<00:07:23.900> really<00:07:24.289> this<00:07:24.500> big<00:07:24.889> bulky

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 
the sheath is really this big bulky

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:30.309 
the sheath is really this big bulky
cheap<00:07:27.319> low<00:07:27.710> quality<00:07:28.069> sheet<00:07:28.550> so<00:07:29.270> overall<00:07:30.050> I

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 
cheap low quality sheet so overall I

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.159 
cheap low quality sheet so overall I
have<00:07:30.650> to<00:07:30.830> give<00:07:30.949> the<00:07:31.099> knife<00:07:31.280> a<00:07:31.669> mere<00:07:32.479> six<00:07:32.930> out<00:07:33.139> of

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
have to give the knife a mere six out of

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:37.270 
have to give the knife a mere six out of
ten<00:07:33.729> that<00:07:34.729> being<00:07:35.030> said<00:07:35.360> if<00:07:35.870> you<00:07:36.530> are<00:07:36.830> simply

would<00:07:51.110> say<00:07:51.259> the<00:07:51.380> Gerber<00:07:51.710> Freeman<00:07:52.160> hunter<00:07:52.520> can

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:53.409 
would say the Gerber Freeman hunter can

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:57.430 
would say the Gerber Freeman hunter can
definitely<00:07:54.409> live<00:07:55.070> up<00:07:55.280> to<00:07:55.520> that<00:07:55.729> need<00:07:56.300> so<00:07:57.080> that

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 
definitely live up to that need so that

definitely live up to that need so that
is<00:07:57.949> my<00:07:58.130> review<00:07:58.340> of<00:07:58.580> the<00:07:58.970> Gerber<00:07:59.240> Freeman
