00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.490
 the staff are here with one more point 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.260
 All will teach you today, will you sing? 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 some fruit plants 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 We started drilling holes, you can. 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.800
 see in the video there we are here 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.650
 making a hole that has to dig a 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.130
 hole a little deep to do 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 power entire arraes of bye 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.450
 buried can not be such a hole. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.489
 background buries the plant but can not 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.470
 be a hole so fast that it embraces 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:36.539
 roots stay out of her clutter 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.359
 stay out of the classic how planting is 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.100
 good to take a bada also always that 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.089
 It is important that the fashion that makes her 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 grow up 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.550
 the darpa dig a hole like 50 to 60 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 centimeters and we'll always dig 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.749
 remembering that never go to ground when the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.550
 land had very dry even look good 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.499
 here we are putting some of the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.780
 substrate now we dodÃ´ that 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.899
 had a pot people put a substrate 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.579
 to be able to give a doubt a neon doubt 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.470
 You can see you can see the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.950
 value of theft 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 You get a pair of scissors and a knife. 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.570
 cut off the plastic and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 classic is how you are going to plant yourselves 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.909
 can see so what the cut is eth not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.329
 can cut deep while hurting 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.030
 turn on the roots count down to the tip 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.820
 can not cut the base if you want to 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.180
 We did not cut it but look how dumb 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.850
 full of roots he informed 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.450
 everybody tightening up, you vote 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.979
 in the hole see the size will work out 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 if the brain size hisses little 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.210
 mud but now that we gave it go 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.119
 putting bar complete with mud up 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.359
 9 that when we let up on 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.430
 then of him leaving nothing of the 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.430
 lump it out and always leaving clod 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.159
 well buried in the plant is able to stay 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.609
 well whole even so tight teach 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.409
 fado graphic teaching fix the plant for 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.929
 do not get too soft since we did 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.009
 a hole in the middle bottom is 50 to 60 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.530
 centimeters 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.840
 more or less the ideal concludes in the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.850
 neighborhood at the base of the lid 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.070
 I do not that heavy to establish good O 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.930
 we walk into the firm well because it has 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.910
 a firmer earth after 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 planted well here we are already 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.070
 planting on the other foot this is a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.310
 What he did not're here he gave in a fallen 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.810
 clod in the clod did not settle very well but 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.240
 anyway you can deploy 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.790
 if I fall torralvo only clear with more 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.920
 careful not to be careful not to 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.830
 turn off entire switches 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.200
 We've dropped a lot and he did not have many 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.420
 roots and did not return to roots 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.090
 but you can also leave a fixed amount 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.370
 well she's upset that she loosened the net 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.410
 You must have loosened the ends we 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.280
 lie to see why it could not ruin 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.070
 Even more 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.410
 yet you can stamp what 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.290
 here guava all you can count 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.990
 that's because she really is 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.010
 the way you accept by digging a 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.390
 50 and 60 centimeters her campaign well 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.430
 tightening up teaches you even more when 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.600
 Look how crazy she is that there are not many. 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.300
 roots 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.620
 you can walk well through the mall 3 well 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.890
 fixed even good here we have another 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.230
 hole that plant guava foot mango 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.620
 Guava also had show the holes 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.320
 Ready, but we did not take the tape. 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.930
 is still good we will take away the 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.930
 room type wow can you see if people 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.380
 boot substrate all on the basis of the race 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.580
 blended when mixed well and 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.960
 cutting the ends and cutting a 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.180
 plastic ruben and cut to 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.250
 to vote because you do not have to count 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.830
 with part because otherwise it will not 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.740
 develop what you take away with 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.530
 careful its bad not destroy much 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.170
 because otherwise she loses much and 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.960
 total is already easier to plant everything 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.600
 that she develops some new ones better 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.900
 getting back to the roots do not miss 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.960
 softening and going in england 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.210
 fixing dp grows this gives even a year 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.790
 two years already is a big and beautiful foot 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.770
 but always taking care never to look too much 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.320
 also but always leaving her wet 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.940
 because the whole plant has water 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.030
 Who always remembered 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.190
 since it is tight because otherwise it is very 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.680
 complicated everything tight stayed very 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.630
 loose and here we do not have it here 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.210
 year but it's always good to be here to change 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.620
 It will also make you well aware that she 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.100
 receive a challenge and I'm not all pie 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.230
 unconditionally 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.380
 ok we are already digging another hole 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.280
 sing a little less or which is a whole 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.190
 slightly smaller 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.790
 You can tell her to make a hole. 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:58.540
 - background this is a style that is 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:02.730
 also putting Ben is barbie terrain 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:08.490
 it was not so good I had some more stones 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:12.220
 it was too late neighborhoods also leaked 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.540
 You just look good, you will be rearranging the screen. 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.390
 fit well 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.610
 bike boat back the neighborhood is very right 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.460
 the boat underneath it gets even more 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.380
 high that can not sink the car 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.970
 looking can not cover her car that 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.430
 It's kind of complicated, you have to leave me. 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.630
 stay out until the plant breathes 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.940
 so you wind up closing like this 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.490
 and will always stay looking mute 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.520
 straight there has to be common with tightening 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.410
 well there is improvement a little and being 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.600
 remembering this scene was attacked nor 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.660
 Always good to be here for a change in 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.690
 even this format is small since 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.890
 I had a shrub plant she did not give 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.010
 does not grow much 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.930
 The roster is somewhat less was 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.570
 banking is a big deal 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.150
 george also tries to ride big then 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.790
 That's why it 's good to be annoyed by the 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.160
 fashion induce the woman to be straight that 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.410
 always growing up straight and wanting better in 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.050
 better than grow sideways 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.600
 well here we stand with one foot 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.180
 plum and say that there is a sprout of people 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.730
 take off this bud which is not to be 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.040
 leave the boy and if in a wheel the force 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.620
 from the mule this is a change that in the clod 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.570
 is more difficult to be found that 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.210
 many plants are now made in the 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.160
 cartridge as you have seen before 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.050
 but both then are still made 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.540
 can find in various places you 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.000
 can plant with the same clod 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.370
 there are stocco if shape of prints can 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.380
 leave it because she rots councilor 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.210
 as it does not have much problem 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.360
 The important thing is not to let the cut 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.420
 set but the wrong stop loss after 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.360
 very calm you can leave if you want 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.040
 You can take it, too. It 's good, you hit. 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.200
 point of earth to fit well 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.130
 can see with her clod 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.990
 different is round rounded oval and 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.830
 if you ask for the wick is also a gift that is 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.080
 great 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.720
 produce constant with various worlds 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.360
 created it will produce quite good and 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.220
 was beginning to sprout do not have to 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.680
 worry about hiding too dry 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.250
 not much foliage because the leaf 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:24.580
 Come on , relax, it's just her time. 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.920
 good wick to the blood wick or a 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.800
 mecha rock as a whole said she is 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.080
 red on the outside or rock on the outside and 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.690
 very red red inside not 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.760
 very good move provincial links and even 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.010
 I recommend it because it is one of the 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.980
 better in wicks by common at last 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.860
 This would be a 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.560
 very good single chance is also not 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.110
 annoying but could be she is already 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.360
 change straight but over time sometimes it was 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.400
 that's why complicating me in the 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.220
 m if you're going to talk one with the big sea 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.770
 with several varieties to label and 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.510
 demarcating what's good here now 

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.940
 after you planted will play one 

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.350
 atom when I was well year button who 

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.750
 liked and subscribe to the channel 

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.750
 share the video and even more than sun
