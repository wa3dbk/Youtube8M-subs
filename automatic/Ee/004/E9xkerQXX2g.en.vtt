00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
to a technician but what we're trying to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.940 
to a technician but what we're trying to
do<00:01:28.240> is<00:01:28.480> we're<00:01:29.050> trying<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.350> show<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.650> it

do is we're trying to show you that it
is<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.220> lot<00:01:30.460> easier<00:01:30.640> than<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.210> think<00:01:31.450> because

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
is a lot easier than you think because

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.740 
is a lot easier than you think because
what<00:01:32.530> happens<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.070> every<00:01:33.220> single<00:01:34.120> time<00:01:34.420> that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
what happens is every single time that

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.130 
what happens is every single time that
you<00:01:35.290> install<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:36.250> new<00:01:36.550> program<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.630> go<00:01:37.870> to<00:01:37.930> a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
you install a new program you go to a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.250 
you install a new program you go to a
website<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:39.010> adds<00:01:39.640> all<00:01:40.180> these<00:01:40.390> entries<00:01:40.990> and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
website it adds all these entries and

and adware uninstall entries and it

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.840 
and adware uninstall entries and it
really<00:01:46.780> slows<00:01:47.290> down<00:01:47.530> your<00:01:47.590> computer<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.640> all
