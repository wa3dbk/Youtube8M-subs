00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
asking me to compare the battery how

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.210 
asking me to compare the battery how
does<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> battery<00:00:21.810> stand<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.769> kernel

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
does the battery stand up on this kernel

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.380 
does the battery stand up on this kernel
how<00:00:23.340> does<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> battery<00:00:23.730> stand<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.330> that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
how does the battery stand up on that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.170 
how does the battery stand up on that
wrong<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.590> device<00:00:25.949> versus<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.789> device

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
wrong or that device versus that device

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.230 
wrong or that device versus that device
there's<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.320> many<00:00:28.470> different<00:00:28.769> factors<00:00:29.400> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
there's so many different factors that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.750 
there's so many different factors that
can<00:00:30.869> take<00:00:31.590> place<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.279> play<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> role<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:34.010> how<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
can take place or play a role in how the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760 
can take place or play a role in how the
performance<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.300> each<00:00:36.360> individual<00:00:37.260> devices

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

take<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> look<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.879> previous<00:01:03.329> benchmarks

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
take a look at previous benchmarks

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.539 
take a look at previous benchmarks
because<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.739> application<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
because that's what this application is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
because that's what this application is
is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> battery<00:01:06.390> benchmark<00:01:07.229> application<00:01:07.890> if

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
is a battery benchmark application if

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
is a battery benchmark application if
you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.159> believe<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.570> opinion

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you can believe it or not in my opinion

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
unable to see previous benchmark scores
and<00:01:25.009> comparisons<00:01:26.009> whereas<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.939> pro<00:01:27.150> version

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and comparisons whereas the pro version

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.960 
and comparisons whereas the pro version
allows<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.189> anyways<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.790> off

application is really cool and techie in
my<00:01:37.710> opinion<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.220> looks<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.670> really<00:01:38.880> neat

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
my opinion it looks really really neat

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.140 
my opinion it looks really really neat
it's<00:01:39.840> also<00:01:39.990> moderately<00:01:40.890> simplistic<00:01:41.610> not<00:01:41.880> too

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's also moderately simplistic not too

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's also moderately simplistic not too
difficult<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.689> understand<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.130> guys

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
difficult to understand so you guys

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399 
difficult to understand so you guys
should<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.360> able<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.720> take<00:01:45.990> advantage<00:01:46.200> of

this both rom flashers and people

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
this both rom flashers and people
without<00:01:49.920> roots<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.759> wanting

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you've got the options to auto stop now

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.499 
you've got the options to auto stop now
generally<00:01:58.070> they<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.579> generally<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
hour of the benchmarking test to be able

to produce a actual legitimate benchmark

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.869 
to produce a actual legitimate benchmark
but<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> option<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.640> don't

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
but you do have the option if you don't

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.070 
but you do have the option if you don't
want<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.120> pay<00:02:12.239> attention

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
want to pay attention

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.360 
want to pay attention
too<00:02:14.080> because<00:02:14.350> what<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.800> don't<00:02:14.890> have<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.250> set

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
too because what you don't have to set

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.160 
too because what you don't have to set
to<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.640> that's<00:02:15.790> only<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.150> auto<00:02:16.510> stop<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.960> can<00:02:17.080> go

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
to it that's only the auto stop I can go

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.630 
to it that's only the auto stop I can go
ahead<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.410> start<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.100> stop<00:02:18.400> it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
ahead and start it and then stop it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
see how well it performs within a 24

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.730 
see how well it performs within a 24
hour<00:02:28.120> time<00:02:28.300> period<00:02:28.330> when<00:02:29.320> you've<00:02:29.440> got<00:02:29.560> that

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
hour time period when you've got that

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.260 
hour time period when you've got that
ability<00:02:29.830> right<00:02:30.220> there<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:30.970> we<00:02:31.000> were<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.180> go

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
ability right there so if we were to go

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.910 
ability right there so if we were to go
ahead<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.540> click<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.810> start<00:02:32.170> there<00:02:32.410> I'm<00:02:32.740> gonna

ahead and click on start there I'm gonna

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.530 
ahead and click on start there I'm gonna
let<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.100> run<00:02:33.310> for<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.640> two<00:02:33.850> seconds<00:02:34.300> here

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
let this run for like two seconds here

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.000 
let this run for like two seconds here
and<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:35.050> for<00:02:35.170> demonstration<00:02:35.320> purposes

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and just for demonstration purposes

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.800 
and just for demonstration purposes
we're<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.340> go<00:02:36.400> ahead<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.730> hit<00:02:36.850> stop<00:02:37.300> now

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
we're going to go ahead and hit stop now

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.180 
we're going to go ahead and hit stop now
like<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.110> mentioned<00:02:38.320> before<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.800> isn't

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
like I mentioned before this isn't

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.370 
like I mentioned before this isn't
enough<00:02:39.520> time<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.090> give<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.660> application<00:02:41.260> of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
enough time to give the application of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.000 
enough time to give the application of
Full<00:02:41.590> benchmark<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:42.970> won't<00:02:43.150> be<00:02:43.240> able<00:02:43.420> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
Full benchmark so I won't be able to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.530 
Full benchmark so I won't be able to
click<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.190> publish<00:02:45.790> or<00:02:46.150> anything<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.420> that

to<00:02:47.410> publish<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.860> benchmarks<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:48.520> just<00:02:48.700> to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
to publish the benchmarks but just to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.060 
to publish the benchmarks but just to
give<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.000> guys<00:02:49.120> an<00:02:49.300> idea<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.710> what<00:02:50.710> happens
