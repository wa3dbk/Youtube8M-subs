00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840 
could be back in action in a week
versus<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.840> year<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> tracked<00:00:56.579> down<00:00:56.640> the

surgery in Canada and take advantage of
the<00:01:01.530> french-canadian<00:01:02.160> treaty<00:01:03.830> because<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the french-canadian treaty because it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670 
the french-canadian treaty because it
wasn't<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> legit<00:01:06.270> medical<00:01:07.049> procedure<00:01:07.409> he

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
my room at the Pam

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.719 
my room at the Pam
before<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.240> surgery<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:19.189> wondered<00:01:20.189> why<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
before the surgery I wondered why I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.280 
before the surgery I wondered why I
wasn't<00:01:20.939> illegal<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> US<00:01:21.630> because

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
wasn't illegal in the US because

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 
wasn't illegal in the US because
athletes<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> larger<00:01:24.390> caliber<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
athletes on on a larger caliber just it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.679 
athletes on on a larger caliber just it
costs<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.460> money<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.240> skip<00:01:27.450> games

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
costs them so much money to skip games

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.149 
costs them so much money to skip games
and<00:01:27.930> stuff<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.290> could<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.560> back<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.950> week

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and stuff they could be back in a week

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.170 
and stuff they could be back in a week
and<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:30.299> curious<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.250> he<00:01:32.250> said<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.060> one

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and so I was curious and he said the one

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
and so I was curious and he said the one
thing<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.450> FDA<00:01:33.689> did<00:01:34.020> agree<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.710> that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
thing the FDA did agree on is that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
thing the FDA did agree on is that
anesthesia<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.060> more<00:01:36.689> dangerous<00:01:37.079> than<00:01:37.530> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
anesthesia is more dangerous than this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
anesthesia is more dangerous than this
actual<00:01:38.130> surgery<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.270> someone<00:01:39.570> could<00:01:39.689> do

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
actual surgery and if someone could do

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929 
actual surgery and if someone could do
it<00:01:39.900> without<00:01:39.960> anesthesia<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.700> could<00:01:41.880> be

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it without anesthesia then that could be

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.600 
it without anesthesia then that could be
a<00:01:42.060> good<00:01:42.390> case<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.070> resubmit<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> FDA

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a good case to resubmit it to the FDA

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.960 
a good case to resubmit it to the FDA
and<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> sanctioned<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.320> approved<00:01:46.970> at

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and get it sanctioned and approved at

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
and get it sanctioned and approved at
first<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.420> was<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.799> well<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.860> could<00:01:49.920> save<00:01:50.159> some

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
first I was like well I could save some

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.609 
first I was like well I could save some
money<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
I've never stayed awake during a surgery

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.639 
I've never stayed awake during a surgery
and<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> got<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.290> morbidly

curious on what it would be like to to
see<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.250> could<00:02:02.399> take<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.610> pain<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.710> the

and<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.690> give<00:02:10.140> me<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> local<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> cut

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
and so so they give me a local to cut

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.160 
and so so they give me a local to cut
the<00:02:11.190> skin<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.180> didn't<00:02:12.720> feel<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.959> skin

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
the skin so that I didn't feel the skin

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.070 
the skin so that I didn't feel the skin
being<00:02:13.410> cut<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:15.270> then<00:02:15.690> he's<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
being cut and then then he's like you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.170 
being cut and then then he's like you
know<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.680> can't<00:02:16.920> numb<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.220> bone<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:17.730> by<00:02:18.150> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
know we can't numb the bone at all by a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.449 
know we can't numb the bone at all by a
local<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.950> doesn't<00:02:20.250> work<00:02:20.400> so

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
local because it just doesn't work so

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.570 
local because it just doesn't work so
you're<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.239> feel<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:23.489> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
you're going to feel this and and I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.120 
you're going to feel this and and I
guess<00:02:23.790> he<00:02:23.940> didn't<00:02:24.209> have<00:02:24.739> enough<00:02:25.739> assistance

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
guess he didn't have enough assistance

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.760 
guess he didn't have enough assistance
and<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:26.760> he<00:02:26.970> asked<00:02:27.239> me<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.420> help<00:02:27.720> stabilize<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
and so he asked me to help stabilize the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.270 
and so he asked me to help stabilize the
drill

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
drill

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.190 
drill
he<00:02:30.180> starts<00:02:30.480> drilling<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.690> had<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.870> grab

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
of the country so now all my other

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.110 
of the country so now all my other
surgeries<00:04:59.040> I've<00:04:59.190> had<00:04:59.220> on<00:04:59.460> this<00:04:59.580> need<00:04:59.850> to

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
surgeries I've had on this need to

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.080 
surgeries I've had on this need to
replace<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.750> ligament<00:05:01.790> doesn't<00:05:02.790> have<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:02.970> go

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
replace that ligament doesn't have to go

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.129 
replace that ligament doesn't have to go
through<00:05:03.270> FDA<00:05:03.630> because<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.919> repair<00:05:05.520> work<00:05:05.760> and

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
through FDA because it's repair work and

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.760 
through FDA because it's repair work and
it's<00:05:07.139> not<00:05:07.200> original<00:05:07.860> surgery<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:08.730> it's<00:05:09.450> still

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
it's not original surgery so it's still

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:26.570 
it's not original surgery so it's still
I<00:05:10.770> guess<00:05:11.460> still<00:05:11.639> worked<00:05:11.850> out<00:05:12.000> for<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.210> better

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580
