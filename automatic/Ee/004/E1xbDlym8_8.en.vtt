00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
the 1860s there wasn't so much as a

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.440 
the 1860s there wasn't so much as a
cowboy<00:02:11.709> boot<00:02:11.950> as<00:02:12.400> such<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.910> was<00:02:12.970> more<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.360> a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
cowboy boot as such it was more of a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
cowboy boot as such it was more of a
work<00:02:13.630> boot<00:02:13.950> between<00:02:14.950> 1880<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:16.019> 1900<00:02:17.019> is<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
work boot between 1880 and 1900 is the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.810 
work boot between 1880 and 1900 is the
time<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.880> they<00:02:19.000> started<00:02:19.480> actually

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
time that they started actually

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.100 
time that they started actually
developing<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.880> boot<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.450> looks<00:02:22.720> like<00:02:22.900> it

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
developing the boot that looks like it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.110 
developing the boot that looks like it
does<00:02:23.320> now

does now
it<00:02:25.120> was<00:02:25.269> probably<00:02:25.480> then<00:02:25.989> in<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> 40s<00:02:27.040> when

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
it was probably then in in the 40s when

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.789 
it was probably then in in the 40s when
