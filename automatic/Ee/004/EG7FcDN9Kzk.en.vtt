00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
will take a little bit of the time the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.240 
will take a little bit of the time the
best<00:01:39.330> way<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:39.900> pick<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.730> fresh<00:01:42.090> thyme<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:43.250> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
best way to pick the fresh thyme is you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.180 
best way to pick the fresh thyme is you
actually<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:46.080> far<00:01:46.350> end<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> thyme

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
actually take the far end and the thyme

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually take the far end and the thyme
and<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.820> against<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.540> against<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and then you go against the against the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
and then you go against the against the
leaves<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.370> the<00:01:50.550> best<00:01:50.760> way<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> pull

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
leaves and that's the best way to pull

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.440 
leaves and that's the best way to pull
off<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.800> thyme<00:01:53.040> leaves<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.970> fastest

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
off the thyme leaves that's the fastest

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.340 
off the thyme leaves that's the fastest
way<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> we'll<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> few<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.550> that<00:01:56.670> going

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
way so we'll get a few of that going

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.740 
way so we'll get a few of that going
look<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.980> there<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.760> thyme<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
look at that on there a little thyme and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.250 
look at that on there a little thyme and
then<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.770> same<00:02:02.040> idea<00:02:02.670> goes<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> oregano

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
then the same idea goes for the oregano

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.650 
then the same idea goes for the oregano
is<00:02:04.650> falling<00:02:05.010> pulling<00:02:05.370> against<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.150> back

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
is falling pulling against and back

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.210 
is falling pulling against and back
against<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.260> leaves<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.010> best

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
against the leaves and that's the best

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.330 
against the leaves and that's the best
way<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:09.050> get<00:02:10.050> those<00:02:10.320> off<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.800> stem<00:02:11.070> because

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
way to get those off the stem because

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.930 
way to get those off the stem because
you<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.730> want<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> stem<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.370> ought

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
you don't want the stem and that ought

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.730 
you don't want the stem and that ought
to<00:02:15.210> be<00:02:15.330> perfect<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.260> we'll<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.710> a

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
to be perfect and then we'll just do a

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:28.059 
to be perfect and then we'll just do a
quick<00:02:16.980> chop<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:17.700> those

the same thing with our Gruyere and then

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.920 
the same thing with our Gruyere and then
we<00:03:38.390> will<00:03:39.610> add<00:03:40.610> our<00:03:40.670> little<00:03:41.180> French<00:03:41.480> petit

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
like to do everything in odd numbers not

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.250 
like to do everything in odd numbers not
a<00:04:19.640> lot<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:20.000> things<00:04:20.210> are<00:04:20.360> even<00:04:20.630> in<00:04:20.750> nature<00:04:21.110> if

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
a lot of things are even in nature if

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.600 
a lot of things are even in nature if
you<00:04:21.380> look<00:04:21.530> at<00:04:21.650> leaves<00:04:21.860> and<00:04:22.280> how<00:04:22.340> everything

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
you look at leaves and how everything

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.330 
you look at leaves and how everything
grows<00:04:22.940> it's<00:04:23.530> more<00:04:24.530> natural<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.980> have<00:04:25.160> odd

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
grows it's more natural to have odd

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.100 
grows it's more natural to have odd
numbers<00:04:25.640> so<00:04:26.180> that's<00:04:26.270> why<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.510> like<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.810> do<00:04:26.930> that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
numbers so that's why I like to do that

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.800 
numbers so that's why I like to do that
maybe<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:27.770> just<00:04:27.860> me<00:04:28.510> then<00:04:29.510> let's<00:04:30.410> add<00:04:30.650> some

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810
