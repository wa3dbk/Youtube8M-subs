am<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.599> kicking<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> into<00:00:28.199> high<00:00:28.349> gear

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
am going to be kicking it into high gear

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
am going to be kicking it into high gear
with<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:29.099> attacks<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.810> hopefully<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.960> can

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
with my attacks and hopefully we can

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.069 
with my attacks and hopefully we can
make<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> into<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> 3400<00:00:32.579> trophy<00:00:33.120> range<00:00:33.360> for

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079

the<00:00:34.170> next<00:00:34.200> video<00:00:35.059> okay<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.120> i<00:00:36.270> hit<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> jackpot

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the next video okay so i hit the jackpot

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.920 
the next video okay so i hit the jackpot
for<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> attack<00:00:37.860> because<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:39.450> total<00:00:39.840> amount

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
for this attack because the total amount

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.130 
for this attack because the total amount
of<00:00:40.230> trophies<00:00:40.620> available<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> 39<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.840> i<00:00:42.960> can

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
of trophies available is 39 so if i can

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.959 
of trophies available is 39 so if i can
beat<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.440> guy<00:00:43.680> i'm<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> get<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> total

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

of<00:00:45.149> thirteen<00:00:45.690> trophies<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.940> 39<00:00:47.940> trophies

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
of thirteen trophies and 39 trophies

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.319 
of thirteen trophies and 39 trophies
available<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.410> hard<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> find<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> I've

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
available is really hard to find so I've

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.729 
available is really hard to find so I've
never<00:00:51.480> attacked<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> style<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.379> base<00:00:52.530> before

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
never attacked the style of base before

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
never attacked the style of base before
and<00:00:53.160> that's<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.059> wizard<00:00:54.329> towers<00:00:54.660> are

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and that's because the wizard towers are

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
and that's because the wizard towers are
on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> outside<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.250> protecting<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.820> good

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
on the outside and the protecting a good

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.990 
on the outside and the protecting a good
amount<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> buildings<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.820> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
amount of buildings so I do see this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.939 
amount of buildings so I do see this
base<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> lot<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.930> Champions<00:01:01.469> League<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
base a lot in the Champions League and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.590 
base a lot in the Champions League and
it<00:01:02.190> would<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.640> awesome<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.570> could

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it would be really awesome if I could

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.530 
it would be really awesome if I could
figure<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> beat<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> oh<00:01:06.270> i

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
figure out a way to beat it oh i

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300 
figure out a way to beat it oh i
was<00:01:06.990> expecting<00:01:07.320> those<00:01:07.590> lightning<00:01:07.830> spells<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
was expecting those lightning spells to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490 
was expecting those lightning spells to
take<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.760> wizard<00:01:09.150> tower<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:10.380> they

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
take out that wizard tower but they

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.740 
take out that wizard tower but they
didn't<00:01:10.830> oh<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:12.180> least<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.450> took<00:01:12.630> out

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
didn't oh well at least they took out

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.929 
didn't oh well at least they took out
the<00:01:12.840> clan<00:01:13.020> castle<00:01:13.049> troops<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:14.460> anyways<00:01:14.760> like

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the clan castle troops but anyways like

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.550 
the clan castle troops but anyways like
I<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.090> saying<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.960> figure<00:01:16.140> out<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> way

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
I was saying if we can figure out a way

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
I was saying if we can figure out a way
to<00:01:16.619> beat<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.979> base<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.119> add<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to beat this base and we can add it to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.380 
to beat this base and we can add it to
the<00:01:18.689> list<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:19.020> bases<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.770> attack

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
the list of bases that we can attack

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.850 
the list of bases that we can attack
okay<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.450> here's<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> plan<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
okay so here's the plan I'm going to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.770 
okay so here's the plan I'm going to
deploy<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> bunch<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.729> extra<00:01:23.970> troops<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.600> here

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
deploy a bunch of extra troops over here

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
deploy a bunch of extra troops over here
in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> deeper<00:01:25.229> area<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:26.640> troops

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
in the deeper area so that way my troops

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
in the deeper area so that way my troops
can<00:01:27.299> push<00:01:27.479> towards<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> middle<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> take<00:01:28.470> out

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
can push towards the middle and take out

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.410 
can push towards the middle and take out
the<00:01:28.650> archer<00:01:29.189> tower<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.579> hair<00:01:29.700> defense<00:01:30.000> and

need<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> couple<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.560> buildings<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.220> we

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
need a couple more buildings and we

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.789 
need a couple more buildings and we
should<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.700> good<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.200> honestly<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.290> didn't

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
should be good to go honestly I didn't

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.870 
should be good to go honestly I didn't
think<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.670> able<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
think that I was going to be able to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
think that I was going to be able to
beat<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.210> base<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:50.009> kind<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> scared<00:01:50.579> when

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
beat this base I get kind of scared when

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.310 
beat this base I get kind of scared when
attacking<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.299> base<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> wizard<00:01:52.049> towers

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
attacking a base with the wizard towers

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310 
attacking a base with the wizard towers
on<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> outside<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.570> did<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.930> 13

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
on the outside but we did get 13

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.350 
on the outside but we did get 13
trophies<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.979> now<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.700> attack<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.149> base

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
trophies and now we can attack this base

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.139 
trophies and now we can attack this base
so<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.320> pretty<00:01:58.500> awesome<00:01:58.820> ok<00:01:59.820> so<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
so that's pretty awesome ok so this

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
so that's pretty awesome ok so this
second<00:02:00.630> raid<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.020> another<00:02:01.439> base<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> have

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
second raid is another base that I have

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
second raid is another base that I have
not<00:02:02.340> attacked<00:02:02.700> before<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:04.350> obvious

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
not attacked before and for obvious

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.460 
not attacked before and for obvious
reasons

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
reasons

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.400 
reasons
if<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.680> mortars<00:02:06.040> are<00:02:06.310> close<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.850> edge<00:02:07.410> so

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
if the mortars are close to the edge so

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.050 
if the mortars are close to the edge so
we're<00:02:08.649> going<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.160> take<00:02:09.369> out<00:02:09.580> one<00:02:10.030> of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
we're going to have to take out one of

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.210 
we're going to have to take out one of
them<00:02:10.330> with<00:02:10.780> lightning<00:02:11.140> spells<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:12.130> I'm<00:02:12.190> going

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
them with lightning spells so I'm going

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.980 
them with lightning spells so I'm going
to<00:02:12.370> draw<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.610> clan<00:02:13.030> castle<00:02:13.060> troops<00:02:13.390> over<00:02:13.870> to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
to draw the clan castle troops over to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.710 
to draw the clan castle troops over to
this<00:02:14.110> mortar<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.920> take<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.550> out<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.510> see

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
this mortar and take it out you can see

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.450 
this mortar and take it out you can see
that<00:02:16.750> i<00:02:16.900> also<00:02:17.140> took<00:02:17.350> out<00:02:17.650> two<00:02:17.860> other<00:02:18.040> buildings

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
that i also took out two other buildings

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.350 
that i also took out two other buildings
besides<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.240> mortar<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.760> didn't<00:02:22.090> waste<00:02:22.210> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
besides the mortar so we didn't waste a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.600 
besides the mortar so we didn't waste a
new<00:02:22.450> spells<00:02:22.720> percentage<00:02:23.290> wise<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.950> now<00:02:24.430> that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
new spells percentage wise and now that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.370 
new spells percentage wise and now that
the<00:02:24.730> mortar<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.090> taken<00:02:25.360> out<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.660> side<00:02:26.020> we

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the mortar is taken out on this side we

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.910 
the mortar is taken out on this side we
have<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.530> bunch<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.890> buildings<00:02:27.270> unexposed<00:02:28.270> to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
have a bunch of buildings unexposed to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.250 
have a bunch of buildings unexposed to
splash<00:02:29.920> damage<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.910> i<00:02:30.940> drew<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.570> heroes<00:02:31.990> over

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
splash damage so i drew the heroes over

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.010 
splash damage so i drew the heroes over
there<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.880> drop<00:02:33.880> some<00:02:34.090> extra<00:02:34.390> troops<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.870> take

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
there and drop some extra troops to take

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.500 
there and drop some extra troops to take
them<00:02:35.170> out<00:02:35.640> up<00:02:36.640> here<00:02:36.700> at<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.970> top<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.330> don't

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
them out up here at the top we don't

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.060 
them out up here at the top we don't
have<00:02:37.600> any<00:02:37.750> splash<00:02:37.990> hours<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.590> i<00:02:38.620> don't<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:38.950> to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
have any splash hours so i don't have to

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.370 
have any splash hours so i don't have to
worry<00:02:39.310> about<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.750> left<00:02:40.990> side<00:02:41.170> we

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
worry about that but on the left side we

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.830 
worry about that but on the left side we
got<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.770> level<00:02:42.010> 8<00:02:42.310> mortar<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.030> that's<00:02:43.600> going<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
got a level 8 mortar and that's going to

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.090 
got a level 8 mortar and that's going to
limit<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.260> amount<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.590> buildings<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:44.980> we

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
limit the amount of buildings that we

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.400 
limit the amount of buildings that we
take<00:02:45.280> out<00:02:45.430> on<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.730> side<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:46.660> i<00:02:46.690> did<00:02:46.959> take<00:02:46.990> out

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
take out on that side but i did take out

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.900 
take out on that side but i did take out
this<00:02:47.590> mortar<00:02:47.890> over<00:02:48.070> here<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.459> we<00:02:48.490> got<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> bunch

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
this mortar over here so we got a bunch

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.580 
this mortar over here so we got a bunch
of<00:02:49.030> extra<00:02:49.300> buildings<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.260> i<00:02:50.290> was<00:02:50.440> really

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
of extra buildings so i was really

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.280 
of extra buildings so i was really
dependent<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:52.390> got<00:02:52.540> 10<00:02:52.810> trophies

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
dependent on that and we got 10 trophies

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.260 
dependent on that and we got 10 trophies
so<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:53.920> was<00:02:54.040> an<00:02:54.130> awesome<00:02:54.250> win<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.820> let's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
so that was an awesome win and let's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.840 
so that was an awesome win and let's
move<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.870> next<00:02:55.900> attack<00:02:56.670> alright<00:02:57.670> so

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
move on to the next attack alright so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.460 
move on to the next attack alright so
this<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.330> same<00:02:58.570> base<00:02:58.750> layout<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.290> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
this is the same base layout that the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.830 
this is the same base layout that the
number<00:02:59.830> one<00:02:59.950> player<00:03:00.190> uses<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:01.360> let's<00:03:01.630> see<00:03:01.780> if

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
number one player uses so let's see if

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.510 
number one player uses so let's see if
we<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.080> what<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.290> takes<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.620> take<00:03:02.860> out<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.070> top

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
we have what it takes to take out a top

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.449 
we have what it takes to take out a top
players<00:03:03.820> base<00:03:04.770> alright<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:05.950> first<00:03:06.220> things

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
players base alright so first things

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.800 
players base alright so first things
first<00:03:06.550> I'm<00:03:06.880> going<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.090> take<00:03:07.209> out<00:03:07.390> one<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.660> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
first I'm going to take out one of the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.479 
first I'm going to take out one of the
mortars<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.500> there<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.890> two<00:03:09.190> on<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
mortars because there are two on the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.970 
mortars because there are two on the
outside<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:11.080> accidentally<00:03:11.650> dropped<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
outside and I accidentally dropped the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.440 
outside and I accidentally dropped the
lightning<00:03:12.250> spell<00:03:12.459> there<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.970> that's<00:03:13.120> kind<00:03:13.420> of

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
lightning spell there so that's kind of

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.750 
lightning spell there so that's kind of
annoying<00:03:13.690> but<00:03:14.560> unfortunately<00:03:15.519> I'm<00:03:15.670> gonna

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
annoying but unfortunately I'm gonna

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.090
