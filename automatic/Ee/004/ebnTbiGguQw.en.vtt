00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.299 

one<00:00:05.370> six<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.029> then<00:00:06.359> we're<00:00:06.480> gonna<00:00:06.600> simply<00:00:07.309> take

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
one six and then we're gonna simply take

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.970 
one six and then we're gonna simply take
our<00:00:08.490> paint<00:00:09.349> and<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.679> brush<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.250> on

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
our paint and you can brush it on

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.620 
our paint and you can brush it on
however<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.099> don't<00:00:14.219> want<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> leave<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.030> with

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
however we don't want to leave it with

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.850 
however we don't want to leave it with
the<00:00:16.080> brush<00:00:16.320> marks

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.170 

so<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:24.410> could<00:00:24.590> do<00:00:24.740> one<00:00:24.920> of<00:00:24.950> a<00:00:25.130> few<00:00:25.340> things<00:00:25.730> one

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
so you could do one of a few things one

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.540 
so you could do one of a few things one
would<00:00:26.420> be<00:00:26.570> to<00:00:26.689> simply<00:00:27.020> take<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:27.290> rag<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:27.950> blot

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
would be to simply take a rag and blot

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.500 
would be to simply take a rag and blot
the<00:00:28.760> surface<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:32.300> hide<00:00:32.660> brush<00:00:33.500> marks<00:00:34.059> or<00:00:35.059> you

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
the surface to hide brush marks or you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.610 
the surface to hide brush marks or you
could<00:00:35.690> take<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.900> simple<00:00:36.440> brush<00:00:36.650> and<00:00:38.590> use<00:00:39.590> a

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
could take a simple brush and use a

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:50.530 
could take a simple brush and use a
stippling<00:00:40.040> effect<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:42.620> hide<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.100> brush<00:00:43.340> marks

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.180 

so<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.900> brushed<00:00:52.200> it<00:00:52.380> on<00:00:52.560> and<00:00:52.920> then<00:00:53.040> of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so I just brushed it on and then of

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.030 
so I just brushed it on and then of
course<00:00:53.220> we<00:00:53.580> can<00:00:53.640> either<00:00:53.790> stipple<00:00:54.330> it<00:00:57.230> or<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
course we can either stipple it or you

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.810 
course we can either stipple it or you
can<00:00:59.250> also<00:00:59.400> use<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.820> roller<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.890> roll<00:01:01.890> across

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
can also use a roller and roll across

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.140 
can also use a roller and roll across
the<00:01:03.060> surface<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:05.070> remove<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:06.300> brush<00:01:06.600> marks

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.750 

and<00:01:12.150> also<00:01:12.650> remember<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.800> get<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.310> inside

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and also remember to get on the inside

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.540 
and also remember to get on the inside
of<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.090> drawer<00:01:18.350> around<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> edge

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.680 

now<00:01:23.550> that<00:01:23.729> we've<00:01:23.850> painted<00:01:24.240> all<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> diamonds

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
now that we've painted all the diamonds

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.420 
now that we've painted all the diamonds
that<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.260> directly<00:01:25.650> budding<00:01:26.010> up<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> each

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that are not directly budding up to each

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.920 
that are not directly budding up to each
other<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.119> we've<00:01:27.360> allowed<00:01:27.630> these<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
other and we've allowed these to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780

and<00:01:30.180> mask<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.810> off<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.479> begin

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
and mask them off so we can begin

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.359 
and mask them off so we can begin
painting<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.619> rest<00:01:35.010> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> diamonds<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.920> if
