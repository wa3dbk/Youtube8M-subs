00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.740 

as<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.760> deal<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:04.340> um<00:03:04.640> it's<00:03:05.120> lighter<00:03:05.390> than<00:03:05.540> I

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
as a deal it's um it's lighter than I

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.690 
as a deal it's um it's lighter than I
thought<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.080> would<00:03:06.170> be<00:03:06.320> it's<00:03:06.710> a<00:03:07.190> little

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
thought it would be it's a little

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.190 
thought it would be it's a little
thicker<00:03:08.090> than<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.540> thought<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.900> would<00:03:08.990> be<00:03:09.140> as

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
thicker than I thought it would be as

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.930 
thicker than I thought it would be as
well

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.200 

it's<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.600> bad<00:03:12.960> I<00:03:13.320> think<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.490> $20<00:03:15.000> price

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
it's not bad I think at the $20 price

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.020 
it's not bad I think at the $20 price
point

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.449 

make<00:03:18.240> some<00:03:18.480> sense<00:03:18.690> anymore<00:03:19.380> for<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.220> now

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
make some sense anymore for that and now

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.650 
make some sense anymore for that and now
I<00:03:20.490> would<00:03:20.670> said

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
I would said

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.920 
I would said
too<00:03:23.290> late

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.610 

but<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:27.129> it's<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:28.060> pretty<00:03:28.329> thick<00:03:28.659> maybe

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
but it's it's it's pretty thick maybe

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.860 
but it's it's it's pretty thick maybe
ask<00:03:29.859> me

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
ask me

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.330
