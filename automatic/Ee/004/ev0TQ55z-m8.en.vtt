00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.600
 society it's fun this is the first example that confirms that I am 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.689
 montebourg 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.749
 and so it is great pleasure the president who loved 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.999
 a school path began with a literary baccalaureate 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.579
 so we will continue to strengthen them then I did an art school 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 the fine Arts 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.870
 harass the minister 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.460
 which allowed me to touch everything after this year of applied arts end of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.120
 dany boon which is small is integrated of bts 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.270
 etienne 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.700
 but I still continue to apply specifying not desired 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.280
 but she said I decided to forget the effect at the institute 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.850
 french fashion 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.240
 micheline presle and I work freelance for different reasons 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.430
 lately so I spent a year and a half made up of tennis in bruno 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.750
 it is signed commissions 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.600
 why annecy parade and this collection as to renÃ© kojfer in 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.750
 freelance part-time I could have other projects 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.000
 he notes a small meal or child 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 kim made for them one of the six top 14 teams 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.230
 but the trio that allowed to intervene on very varied projects 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.270
 she to meet a lot of people and he dreamed of becoming a machine in the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 creative phase there I'm going to work time based 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.090
 the legendary ranking 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120
 same scenario in humans 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.010
 and currently I am also working on other hotel projects 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.890
 in my corner in Morocco 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.940
 and like the other rue saint-honore in paris with him 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.630
 the lawyer jean marx 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.660
 I know that you have to work in teams for them 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.680
 because it's really 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.320
 6-4 collections 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.770
 he reminds the brain 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.080
 of implementation 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.000
 but finally concretized and philippe the taught also has collections 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.360
 who are huge 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.540
 often we can do it as if the fomc 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.560
 find a theme that will serve as a red thread 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.360
 so that's enough elaborating the topic cost of labor is very 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.899
 important 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.839
 and then after the ten-year half 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.139
 it takes him to realize this idea 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.870
 in this sense the drawings both form and determined to find 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:20.869
 new players 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.279
 - of construction 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.579
 and then report on the prototypes 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:25.919
 volume 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.549
 it is necessary to develop the volume the carcass the canvas 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.609
 then this time it must be corrected 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.609
 and after when a schoolboy the instant the definitive fabric 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.479
 the president but this case like that we are hot 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.479
 so you have to talk between December 1st 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.089
 after the first theme what students 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.629
 and putting it into practice 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.370
 so you have to create it it's very clear it's huge it's very 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.339
 worker 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.339
 she motivates our chancelleries 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.779
 eventually he developed m 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.349
 bertrand strong for them 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.709
 christiane chadal be in peak hiring 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.439
 from 6 to 106 years old, safe-action between art and industry is why 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.299
 did she say 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.120
 but he is happy to note that 8 years of experience that it is very 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.930
 difficult what is good is that I would not like them humorist 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.519
