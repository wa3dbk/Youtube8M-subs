00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.330
 saarlander has long been digitally equipped 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.419
 an ipad is the absolute most important 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.219
 Handicraft what meanwhile have 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.340
 because it is just small and handy 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.900
 and also used in every session 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.550
 can 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.119
 notes are made on the ipad e 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.769
 mails on the ipad everything lousy especially 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.960
 even in my age then that I just 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.789
 also for my generation here politics 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.219
 so can the topics make mine 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.910
 generation will meet 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.219
 family committee compatibility of 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.530
 Family-in-the-job is a big topic 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.870
 or just in the economic committee just 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.600
 the topics digitalize new 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.340
 technologies should not be everything 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.120
 but it should also give some 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.530
 do not give them over 50 cents I go there 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.539
 here for a berlin start up 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.399
 technology is one of my topics 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.530
 and I want to know about them like that 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.199
 Founded is what was good what 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.879
 could have been better and from it 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.410
 then draw conclusions about what the policy 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.449
 maybe can do around boys 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.030
 to help innovative startups better 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.900
 to better support them and I am very 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.900
 curious what the me 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.490
 This company has one online 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.110
 platform designed to travel 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.110
 compare and book faster 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.250
 nadine nicely learns that it is because of the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.870
 German data protection laws difficult 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 was the portal to build 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.130
 a topic that is currently in the network policy 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.820
 getting started and the it experts 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 intense because you busy constituency 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.380
 then I am often happy from the morning 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 I'm late at seven to evening 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.800
 with at the most different dates 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.850
 and also with different dresscode 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.290
 you have to be flexible and that's why 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 is the car of my second flat 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.450
 in a school in her constituency st 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.700
 Wendel launches the day for Nadine nicely 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.890
 relaxed at the seating in the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.560
 she still has something to help parliament 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.409
 because I'm trying that kind of thing 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.289
 access to the everyday life of one 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.080
 because it's a black box 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.630
 for many it has always been like that for me too 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.040
 and then about this everyday life to the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.040
 to political topics 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.070
 Lawyers are married and in theirs 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.870
 home rooted deep before 2009 in 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.640
 the Bundestag came what I already five 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.750
 for years in the Saarland 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 at the beginning of the 20th day a photo with the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.270
 place cd me for the homepage and already 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.270
 the next appointment actually brings 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.020
 spontaneous small talk despite social 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.030
 networks essential personal 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.489
 conversations with entrepreneurs as well 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.070
 here in a grain mill she is the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.709
 youngest Cdu MP in the Bundestag 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.260
 chicks of the union your perspective i 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.770
 I'm sure not as md the trend too 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.220
 go 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.640
 I started too early for that 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.230
 I want to go to the politician time 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.790
 also do something else 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.620
 and yes, it is still standing 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.930
 once the next legislature in the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.430
 foreground and that's what I want 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.480
 my strength and mine 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.480
 to direct my attention 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.610
 nadine got beautiful three years ago 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.400
 as a freshman right in the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.659
 economic committee pre-fought 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.260
 net policy is for you the topic of 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.900
 future 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.959
 for that she wants to continue to work and 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.420
 of course , for your constituency 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.819

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.670

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.500

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.500
 all the best and then everyone 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.290
 at the suggestion of your group is nadine 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.420
 nicely chosen as the secretary 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.130
 in the case of roll-call votes, she provides 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.290
 for example, the result 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.240
 After the election, she would like to 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.200
 continue politics especially for her 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.200
