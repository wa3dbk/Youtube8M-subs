involved in all aspects of the business
for<00:00:48.629> us<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.960> simple<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.530> cows<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> cow

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
for us it's simple a good cows a cow

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.010 
for us it's simple a good cows a cow
that<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.850> born<00:00:51.840> small<00:00:52.199> grows<00:00:52.620> rapidly<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020

medium<00:00:55.020> mature<00:00:55.379> size<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> her

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
medium mature size so that her

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
efficiency is still very high we want

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
efficiency is still very high we want
her<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> calve<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.180> she's<00:01:00.390> two<00:01:00.570> years<00:01:00.780> old

technology and animal science for
generations<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:16.229> started<00:01:16.619> using<00:01:17.990> performance

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
generations we started using performance

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.350 
generations we started using performance
testing<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> use<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> data<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.790> records

we<00:01:24.509> started<00:01:24.869> doing<00:01:24.960> artificial<00:01:25.530> insemination

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
we started doing artificial insemination

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.749 
we started doing artificial insemination
with<00:01:27.530> frozen<00:01:28.530> semen<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> best<00:01:29.340> girls<00:01:29.579> in

the world there in the late 60s we

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
the world there in the late 60s we
started<00:01:31.860> doing<00:01:31.950> embryo<00:01:32.340> transfer<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
started doing embryo transfer in the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.859 
started doing embryo transfer in the
late<00:01:34.170> 70s<00:01:34.860> taking<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> very<00:01:36.000> best<00:01:36.240> cows<00:01:36.540> in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
late 70s taking the very best cows in

late 70s taking the very best cows in

the breed artificially inseminating them
of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> best<00:01:39.390> bulls<00:01:40.250> multiplying<00:01:41.250> those<00:01:41.520> cows

of the best bulls multiplying those cows

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.960 
of the best bulls multiplying those cows
through<00:01:42.920> embryo<00:01:43.920> transfer<00:01:44.460> where<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.820> can

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
through embryo transfer where we can

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.319 
through embryo transfer where we can
have<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> 40<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.560> 50<00:01:46.890> calves<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.369> year<00:01:47.700> from

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
have up to 40 or 50 calves a year from

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.870 
have up to 40 or 50 calves a year from
one<00:01:48.540> cow<00:01:48.860> bred<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.070> actually<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> variety<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.770 

I<00:01:59.280> think<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.520> operation<00:02:01.180> yes<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.660> do

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
I think in this operation yes you do

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.810 
I think in this operation yes you do
have<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:01.990> know<00:02:02.110> more<00:02:02.470> technology<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.220> more

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
have to know more technology and more

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.210 
have to know more technology and more
science<00:02:04.330> we<00:02:05.260> take<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.470> much<00:02:05.770> more<00:02:06.010> scientific

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
science we take a much more scientific

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.999 
science we take a much more scientific
approach<00:02:06.700> than<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.210> lot<00:02:07.390> of<00:02:07.510> operations<00:02:08.140> it's

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
approach than a lot of operations it's

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.580 
approach than a lot of operations it's
changed<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.580> lot<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.330> last<00:02:10.509> 10<00:02:10.810> years<00:02:11.110> it's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
changed a lot in the last 10 years it's

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.830 
changed a lot in the last 10 years it's
