 keep it up 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:15.179
 The German national handball team started well in the

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.959
 pretty fast the top game of the euro of the Bundesliga between 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.439
 Once again it has changed so well from the winter break and those used 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.589
 Lead them through spurs and set the next Sport and Roll on him 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.770
 Men also what Matthias Kurth fifth 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.780
 Ulla the start based on a zock here almost as fast and therefore 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.210

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.880
 Being protected on the body that is very important to the public 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.440
 Places such as the shins 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 but especially interesting is the chassis that are not inliners 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.570
 but the classic roller skates 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.700
 This allows players to record more speed and faster 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.730
 change direction that is yes 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.410
 These sports are very important and also the racket is particularly interesting 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.449
 can be used on both sides 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.000
 So both forehand and from the previous day 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.380
 will be the top match in the day 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.020
 Roller Hockey Bundesliga writes between fourth races 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.890

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.970
 Well of uncertainty or as a success no trace in the leader Iserlohn 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.930
 to swear on their own strength is the bitter defeat of Bernstorff 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.640
 suspiciously saliva them on the cap 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.210
 Today, the leader wants to live up to his role as a favorite again 200 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 By the way, spectators in Remscheid are playing Twenty-five minutes net that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.659
 Playing field 20 times 40 meters 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.020
 The team starts with four field players 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.700
 and a goalkeeper 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.750
 Remscheids number one Matthias Matuschik the virtuoso restless 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 Afternoon at this wage from the beginning 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
 game-defining and we fair Lich 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.710
 that's Matthias Matussek, it really is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.550
 today 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.340
 The table fourth Remscheid in white-blue at home still unbeaten 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.879
 here they just play braver 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.869
 counterrevolutionary 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.869
 July to Heinke 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.089
 and that's his brother Yannic the scorer for ten times already hit it 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.599
 in this she should 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.010
 but Remscheider scoring chance of the first half with rarity value here no 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.739
 Foul on this benefit now that hacked the episode direct free kick 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.159
 crystal clear in the water 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.080
 Hanstein but the margin and respect 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.709
 the unfortunate own goal in the chalk 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.029
 this and leads 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.029
 ten minutes were played there 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.959
 for Matthias Mar 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.159
 but Remscheid hardly shocked 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.049
 Iserlohn made the game but the counterattack of the white-blue dangerous 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.299
 Yannick Peinke 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.930
 and so fast is the Euro Hockey in return Iserlohn now empty 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.869
 But tapes continue only at 0 2 1 children per guide for the 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.099
 leader 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.639
 15 minutes over in the first section and often the same picture mostly 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.709
 Ball possession leads Iserlohn 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.059
 And as a result, chances are the first set of God on Lianas can day 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.059
 at the gate 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.810
 more 0 to 1 then break in Remscheid there is still everything in it for the 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:36.329
 So he continues to host in the spotlight Remscheid goalkeeper Matthias Matuschke 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.329
 Slide 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.929
 the second half 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:46.829
 and the same picture of the leaders are over but where is the 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.829
 effectiveness 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.479
 Günter Harders 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.629
 and then he does it right Thilo reader Loeffler's behavior hour 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.809
 past 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.869
 this two to zero now also matches 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.869
 the gameplay 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.579
 Iserlohn coach of TuS 2 Goller still not completely satisfied 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.719
 Now plague Rancher Tammo was in demand and 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.579
 the home side do not give up on this pay plays Iserlohn dominated 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.240
 but the Remscheid counterattacks remain dangerous Janik at Intel fails 

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:26.490
 Lukas Kost 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.210
 in this Lohner gate 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.210

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.460
 three Lolas 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.559
 so it was like a preliminary decision the defensive are the guests 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.620
 actually hard to crack 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.590
 the last quarter of an hour Remscheid's first home defeat red-red Brenscheidt 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.809
