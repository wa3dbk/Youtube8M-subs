00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
there right now take these bolts out and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:02:13.649 
there right now take these bolts out and
we're<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> start<00:00:53.100> tearing<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> down

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.660 

these<00:02:14.659> right<00:02:14.930> here<00:02:14.980> these<00:02:15.980> are<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.189> torsion

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
these right here these are the torsion

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.270 
these right here these are the torsion
bars<00:02:16.849> that<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.299> removed<00:02:17.689> from<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
bars that we just removed from the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.030 
bars that we just removed from the
Colorado<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:19.909> actually<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:21.620> they<00:02:21.799> use

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
Colorado this is actually what they use

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.429 
Colorado this is actually what they use
in<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.400> truck<00:02:22.670> as<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.120> spring<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.409> a

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
in this truck as the spring this is a

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.960 
in this truck as the spring this is a
attachment<00:02:25.430> suspension<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.360> when<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.170> truck

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
attachment suspension and when the truck

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.160 
attachment suspension and when the truck
suspension<00:02:28.970> goes<00:02:29.150> down<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.689> whole<00:02:29.900> bar

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
suspension goes down this whole bar

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.880 
suspension goes down this whole bar
twists<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.540> basically<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.590> spring

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
twists and basically this is the spring

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.340 
twists and basically this is the spring
of<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.099> truck
