00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 oftentimes 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.130
 is when you install it after you start 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.300

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.360
 the athletic pie here 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.760
 and for those who know 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.690

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.150
 but then you're on this minute 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.260

 It's changing in appearance. 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.390

 ansa 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.699
 each country 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.369
 if you have to do the high going here for the series made 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.029
 here are the models in silver colors 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.409
 it was so with several colors 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.779
 I'm going to play in French and now 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.779

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.859
 ready if you see it changed 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.829
 appearance 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.079
 hyundai keita question 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.919
 and one more cool thing that I 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.679
 it's not that I put it on top 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
 anticipates that here 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.129
 This one 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.619
 sebastien tokyo 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.939
 what do you think makes it look the same more 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.679
 it's not cooler than lows and they do not do it in the strict of these things here 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 I think he stayed 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.609
 The town is much cooler 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.609
 would 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.769
 so then I think you have placed a position 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.870
 helium in it is minimized out here that this vit loss is used 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.399
 in maceiÃ³ 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.449

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.179
 When I felt the first meter, I would then enter 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.899
 you see it's options 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.299
 It's a matter of being down here. 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.029
 pq it is rich in taquara rhythms that you initiated b beyond the limits of 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:53.829
 return 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.319
 what goes 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.299
 tactically tatum tomecek tatra month 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.730
 and if you do not like to get lost 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.730
 but then the other normal 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.359
 will vote for a suspect and come back 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.199

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.109
