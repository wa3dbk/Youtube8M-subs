00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:17.020
 hello welcome to the comparison of bq 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.990
 edison and bq maxwell plus bq edison has 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.210
 a 10.1-inch screen while 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.930
 that maxwell plus comes with the screen 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.989
 of 7 inches so the super we put 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.110
 we will see clearly the difference 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:34.050
 edison is the biggest and biggest plus the 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.480
 little girl 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.510
 as for the thickness more or less have 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.899
 the same and the difference is that the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.650
 macworld plus is charged by the mini usb and 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.720
 the edison by a special connector 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.480
 in the back also 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.850
 we will find a difference and that is 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.120
 comes with a single loudspeaker the maxwell 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.120
 plus 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.600
 while the and are bring two speakers 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.600
 for a stereo sound 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.549
 now let's see the screen quality 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.060
 which is the only thing that is more 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.750
 difference 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.619
 the maxwell plus will bring us a screen 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 7 inch ips with very bright colors 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.700
 alive and very sharp 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.020
 while Jason will show us other 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.020
 colors 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.140
 here you have the difference 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.860
 the performance is the same so no 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.860
 we need to teach it to you 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.610
 so this is all 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.830
 hopefully you liked the video and 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.050
