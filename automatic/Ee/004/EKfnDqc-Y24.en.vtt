00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.169 
four different purposes especially kicks
the<00:00:22.820> knee<00:00:22.999> and<00:00:23.179> the<00:00:23.630> groin<00:00:23.839> area<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.820> groin<00:00:26.029> in

the knee and the groin area the groin in

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.300 
the knee and the groin area the groin in
particular<00:00:26.630> is<00:00:26.839> a<00:00:27.409> very<00:00:27.650> great<00:00:27.829> target<00:00:28.279> for

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
particular is a very great target for

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.899 
particular is a very great target for
self-defense<00:00:29.409> because<00:00:30.409> it<00:00:30.739> injures<00:00:31.730> the

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:31.909 
self-defense because it injures the

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.060 
self-defense because it injures the
opponent<00:00:32.270> it<00:00:32.689> causes<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.079> lack<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.470> balance<00:00:33.859> as

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
opponent it causes a lack of balance as

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.750 
opponent it causes a lack of balance as
well<00:00:34.640> as<00:00:34.699> ability<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.690> walk<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.739> when<00:00:37.640> you're

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
well as ability to walk so when you're

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.700 
well as ability to walk so when you're
doing<00:00:37.910> that<00:00:38.090> most<00:00:38.449> people<00:00:38.780> realize<00:00:39.530> the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
doing that most people realize the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.930 
doing that most people realize the
strike<00:00:39.980> could<00:00:40.160> be<00:00:40.250> coming<00:00:40.609> so<00:00:40.760> they're<00:00:40.910> a

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
strike could be coming so they're a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.060 
strike could be coming so they're a
little<00:00:41.090> bit<00:00:41.239> more<00:00:41.269> apt<00:00:41.899> to<00:00:42.170> protect<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.800> area

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
little bit more apt to protect the area

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.259 
little bit more apt to protect the area
they're<00:00:43.250> not<00:00:43.370> gonna<00:00:43.489> see<00:00:43.579> like<00:00:43.699> people<00:00:43.789> stand

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
they're not gonna see like people stand

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.090 
they're not gonna see like people stand
facing<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:44.930> this<00:00:45.109> way<00:00:45.289> they're<00:00:45.769> gonna<00:00:45.859> have

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
facing you this way they're gonna have

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.639 
facing you this way they're gonna have
more<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.489> better<00:00:47.000> stance<00:00:47.329> like<00:00:47.539> this<00:00:47.899> okay

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649

if those hands come open it leaves the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.680 
if those hands come open it leaves the
target<00:00:57.699> available<00:00:58.730> okay

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
target available okay

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.630 
target available okay
other<00:01:00.320> things<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:00.649> can<00:01:00.710> do<00:01:00.949> is<00:01:01.070> actually<00:01:01.249> set

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
other things you can do is actually set

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.669 
other things you can do is actually set
up<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:01.940> strike<00:01:02.210> yourself<00:01:02.690> as<00:01:02.899> soon<00:01:03.440> as<00:01:03.589> you

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
up the strike yourself as soon as you

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.100 
up the strike yourself as soon as you
throw<00:01:03.890> one<00:01:04.160> hand<00:01:04.550> let's<00:01:04.970> say<00:01:05.120> his<00:01:05.360> right<00:01:05.869> hand

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
throw one hand let's say his right hand

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.990 
throw one hand let's say his right hand
is<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.259> little<00:01:06.320> lower<00:01:06.650> if<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.250> throw<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.520> punch<00:01:07.759> to

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
is a little lower if I throw a punch to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.179 
is a little lower if I throw a punch to
make<00:01:08.090> him<00:01:08.270> block<00:01:08.659> with<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:08.990> hand<00:01:09.259> this<00:01:09.740> area

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
make him block with that hand this area

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.600 
make him block with that hand this area
immediately<00:01:10.869> becomes<00:01:11.869> available<00:01:12.170> again<00:01:12.610> okay

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
immediately becomes available again okay

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.359 
immediately becomes available again okay
so<00:01:14.180> another<00:01:14.810> great<00:01:15.049> advantage<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.159> groin

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
so another great advantage of a groin

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.859 
so another great advantage of a groin
strike<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.420> center<00:01:17.689> of<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
strike is that it's in the center of the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.230 
strike is that it's in the center of the
body<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:18.680> even<00:01:19.130> if<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.369> miss<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.880> can<00:01:20.030> still

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
body so even if you miss you can still

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.899 
body so even if you miss you can still
hit<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.390> legs<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:21.020> stomach<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.280> other<00:01:22.460> areas

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
hit the legs the stomach and other areas

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.230 
hit the legs the stomach and other areas
but<00:01:23.750> especially<00:01:24.380> useful<00:01:24.560> in<00:01:25.549> an<00:01:25.820> upward

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
but especially useful in an upward

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.810 
but especially useful in an upward
rising<00:01:26.659> motion<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:27.310> forward<00:01:28.310> kick<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.729> we

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
rising motion a forward kick that we

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.609 
rising motion a forward kick that we
might<00:01:29.000> normally<00:01:29.240> use<00:01:29.659> in<00:01:29.840> kickboxing<00:01:30.469> is

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
might normally use in kickboxing is

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.819 
might normally use in kickboxing is
going<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.579> go<00:01:31.729> like<00:01:31.939> this<00:01:32.079> when<00:01:33.079> striking<00:01:33.710> to

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
going to go like this when striking to

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.100 
going to go like this when striking to
the<00:01:33.890> groin<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.880> generally<00:01:35.240> want<00:01:35.329> to<00:01:35.450> come<00:01:35.630> up

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
the groin you generally want to come up

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.499 
the groin you generally want to come up
into<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:37.040> area<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:37.610> I'm<00:01:37.880> going<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.060> chamber<00:01:38.360> my

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
into the area so I'm going to chamber my

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.139 
into the area so I'm going to chamber my
knee<00:01:38.570> first<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> foot<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:40.579> as<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.850> kicks

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
knee first but the foot so as it kicks

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.370 
knee first but the foot so as it kicks
it's<00:01:41.390> actually<00:01:41.659> going<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.840> be<00:01:41.899> coming<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:42.259> an

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's actually going to be coming in an

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.340 
it's actually going to be coming in an
upward<00:01:42.799> motion<00:01:43.640> like<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:45.049> we<00:01:45.140> want<00:01:45.289> to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
upward motion like so so we want to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.760 
upward motion like so so we want to
avoid<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.619> forward<00:01:46.310> kick<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.820> instead<00:01:47.570> come<00:01:48.469> up

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
avoid a forward kick and instead come up

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.190 
avoid a forward kick and instead come up
with<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.189> rising<00:01:49.520> motion<00:01:49.850> once<00:01:50.600> again<00:01:50.899> this<00:01:51.079> is

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
with a rising motion once again this is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.779 
with a rising motion once again this is
