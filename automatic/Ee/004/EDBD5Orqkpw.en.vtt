00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
mean actually if you count it up for

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.940 
mean actually if you count it up for
everything<00:04:00.400> then<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.000> would<00:04:01.150> be<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.590> lot

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
everything then it would be like a lot

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.660 
everything then it would be like a lot
but<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:04.720> doesn't<00:04:05.019> really<00:04:05.140> matter<00:04:05.409> so<00:04:05.860> I'm

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
this pack opening might be a little bit

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.820

of<00:04:45.449> depressing<00:04:46.449> compared<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.289> last<00:04:47.470> ones

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
