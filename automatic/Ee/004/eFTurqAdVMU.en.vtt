00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
compared to the last video i posted and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.389 
compared to the last video i posted and
as<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.529> I've<00:00:31.920> already<00:00:32.099> got

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
as you can see I've already got

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.700 
as you can see I've already got
completed<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.329> entire<00:00:33.480> first<00:00:33.960> layer<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
completed the entire first layer of the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.530 
completed the entire first layer of the
stadium's<00:00:35.130> essentially<00:00:35.940> layers<00:00:36.180> there's

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
stadium's essentially layers there's

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.979 
stadium's essentially layers there's
three<00:00:37.020> essentially<00:00:38.010> most<00:00:38.250> parts<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.989> right

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
three essentially most parts on right

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.750 
three essentially most parts on right
there<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.500> see<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> beginnings<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
there you can see the beginnings of the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.319 
there you can see the beginnings of the
second<00:00:42.239> layer<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> second<00:00:45.210> layer

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
second layer and the second layer

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.020 
second layer and the second layer
all-round<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.820> gap<00:00:47.820> right

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
all-round right there and that gap right

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.680 
all-round right there and that gap right
there<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:49.110> separates<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.690> scoreboard

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
there is what separates the scoreboard

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.889 
there is what separates the scoreboard
from<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> rest<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> stadium<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.899> because

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
from the rest of the stadium and because

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
from the rest of the stadium and because
this<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.320> area<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
this little area right there will be a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.610 
this little area right there will be a
second<00:00:56.789> layer<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> giant

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
second layer and then up to a giant

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.490 
second layer and then up to a giant
scoreboard<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.699> right<00:01:00.260> here<00:01:01.260> will

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
scoreboard right there right here will

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
scoreboard right there right here will
be<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> second<00:01:02.219> layer<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.760> around<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> stadium

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
be a second layer all around the stadium

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.340 
be a second layer all around the stadium
and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.070> wavy<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.420> guess<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.990> could<00:01:07.140> say

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and then a wavy I guess you could say

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
and then a wavy I guess you could say
third<00:01:07.799> layer<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.340> top<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:11.299> well

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
third layer on top of that and well

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.640 
third layer on top of that and well
basically<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.000> um<00:01:15.530> from<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
basically you can see um from the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.109 
basically you can see um from the
previous<00:01:17.070> video<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.369> may<00:01:17.549> remember<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.939> had<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
previous video you may remember I had a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.960 
previous video you may remember I had a
little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> random<00:01:19.259> stuff<00:01:19.470> over<00:01:19.770> there

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
little bit of random stuff over there

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
little bit of random stuff over there
I've<00:01:20.970> gotten<00:01:21.450> rid<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.869> completely<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
I've gotten rid of that completely and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370 
I've gotten rid of that completely and
I've<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.420> started<00:01:24.720> filling<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> back

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I've kind of started filling in the back

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
I've kind of started filling in the back
end<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.830> bit<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.580> main<00:01:26.610> end

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

right now of working on I give you a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
right now of working on I give you a
little<00:01:30.210> field<00:01:30.570> view<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
little field view it there you see the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.749 
little field view it there you see the
tunnels<00:01:32.520> actually<00:01:32.820> came<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.329> good

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
tunnels actually came out really good

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
tunnels actually came out really good
every<00:01:35.759> single<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> them<00:01:36.570> goes<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
every single one of them goes in and I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.920 
every single one of them goes in and I
am<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.640> starting<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.119> make<00:01:39.329> very

am actually starting to make very

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.530 
am actually starting to make very
minimal<00:01:40.380> progress<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.490> second<00:01:42.000> floor<00:01:42.150> of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
minimal progress on the second floor of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.859
