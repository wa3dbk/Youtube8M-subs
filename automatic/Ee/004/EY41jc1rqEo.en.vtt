00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the cylinder was pretty scratched up so

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.000 
the cylinder was pretty scratched up so
I<00:00:19.590> came<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:19.949> here<00:00:20.130> today<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:21.830> took<00:00:22.830> my

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I came out here today and took my

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
maybe an hour and a half

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.060 
maybe an hour and a half
honing<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.170> uh<00:00:29.179> it<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> 45<00:00:30.900> bucks<00:00:31.199> toe<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
honing that uh it was a 45 bucks toe to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.510 
honing that uh it was a 45 bucks toe to
get<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> board<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.390> bbrt

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600 
get it board out at bbrt
but<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> figured<00:00:36.079> you<00:00:37.079> know<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.219> could<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.489> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
but I figured you know if I could do it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.420 
but I figured you know if I could do it
here<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.000> free<00:00:39.559> save<00:00:40.559> me<00:00:40.680> forty<00:00:40.980> five<00:00:41.129> bucks

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
here for free save me forty five bucks

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.709 
here for free save me forty five bucks
so<00:00:42.320> looks<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.620> better<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> piston<00:00:47.719> was

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
so looks a lot better now the piston was

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.700 
so looks a lot better now the piston was
a<00:00:48.920> bit<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> hassle<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> fit<00:00:51.149> but

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
a bit of a hassle to get it to fit but

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.330 
a bit of a hassle to get it to fit but
it's<00:00:52.710> perfect<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:54.410> goes<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:55.890> um

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
it's perfect now goes right in there um

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.740 
it's perfect now goes right in there um
so<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.399> pretty<00:00:59.640> much<00:00:59.699> all<00:01:00.149> my<00:01:00.690> day

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
so that's pretty much all my day

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.770 
so that's pretty much all my day
consisted<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.210> figured<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.359> how<00:01:03.600> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
consisted of I figured out how this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.920 
consisted of I figured out how this
power<00:01:04.019> valve<00:01:04.320> works<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:08.450> got<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> cover<00:01:09.780> on

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
power valve works I got the cover on

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
power valve works I got the cover on
there<00:01:10.110> now<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.890> wasn't<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.189> hard

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
there now but it really wasn't that hard

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
there now but it really wasn't that hard
to<00:01:11.490> figure<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.930> now<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.439> waiting<00:01:13.590> for

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to figure out so now all I'm waiting for

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
to figure out so now all I'm waiting for
is<00:01:14.070> uh<00:01:14.310> some<00:01:14.820> money<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.270> buy<00:01:15.450> some<00:01:15.600> rings
