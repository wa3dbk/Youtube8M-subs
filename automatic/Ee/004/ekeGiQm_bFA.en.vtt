00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
heard news about an indirect military

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.290 
heard news about an indirect military
system<00:00:19.570> what<00:00:20.570> exactly<00:00:21.320> does<00:00:21.529> this<00:00:21.740> mean<00:00:22.300> what

system what exactly does this mean what

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.710 
system what exactly does this mean what
distinguishes<00:00:23.929> it<00:00:24.109> from<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.619> previous<00:00:24.949> game

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
distinguishes it from the previous game

distinguishes it from the previous game
1701<00:00:26.720> ad<00:00:27.189> we<00:00:28.189> asked<00:00:28.550> Dirk<00:00:28.759> regard<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.449> answer

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
1701 ad we asked Dirk regard to answer

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.280 
1701 ad we asked Dirk regard to answer
this<00:00:30.079> interesting<00:00:30.829> question<00:00:31.900> in<00:00:32.900> the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
this interesting question in the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.590 
this interesting question in the
previous<00:00:33.470> owner<00:00:33.829> games<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.610> player<00:00:34.850> was

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
previous owner games the player was

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.170 
previous owner games the player was
commanding<00:00:36.530> single<00:00:36.949> units<00:00:37.280> but<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:37.969> was<00:00:38.149> a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
commanding single units but that was a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.959 
commanding single units but that was a
problem<00:00:38.719> because<00:00:39.199> I<00:00:39.680> know<00:00:39.829> is<00:00:40.039> a<00:00:40.309> building

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
problem because I know is a building

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.720 
problem because I know is a building
game<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.350> unit's<00:00:42.649> got<00:00:42.800> lost<00:00:43.039> you<00:00:43.309> could

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
game so the unit's got lost you could

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.880 
game so the unit's got lost you could
not<00:00:43.879> find<00:00:44.149> them<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.690> was<00:00:44.899> too<00:00:45.079> tactical<00:00:45.620> so

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
not find them it was too tactical so

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.860 
not find them it was too tactical so
this<00:00:46.100> time<00:00:46.340> we<00:00:46.699> choose<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.269> more<00:00:47.719> strategic

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
this time we choose a more strategic

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.549 
this time we choose a more strategic
approach<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:49.550> player<00:00:49.730> builds

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
approach the player builds

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.540 
approach the player builds
infrastructure<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:52.640> encampments<00:00:53.629> and

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
infrastructure and encampments and

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.680 
infrastructure and encampments and
cannon<00:00:55.550> positions<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.179> stuff<00:00:56.329> like<00:00:56.480> that

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
cannon positions and stuff like that

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.910 
cannon positions and stuff like that
okay<00:00:58.239> but<00:00:59.239> which<00:00:59.570> tactical<00:01:00.230> options<00:01:00.649> does

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
okay but which tactical options does

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.860 
okay but which tactical options does
this<00:01:01.129> military<00:01:01.699> system<00:01:02.120> provide<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.660> player

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
this military system provide the player

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.140 
this military system provide the player
with<00:01:03.170> which<00:01:03.800> units<00:01:04.250> does<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.610> player<00:01:04.820> have

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
with which units does the player have

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.760 
with which units does the player have
and<00:01:05.449> what<00:01:05.780> role<00:01:05.990> do<00:01:06.170> they<00:01:06.290> play<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.560> the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
and what role do they play in the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.340 
and what role do they play in the
battles<00:01:07.160> digging<00:01:07.970> deeper<00:01:08.360> Dirk<00:01:08.750> Leggett<00:01:09.170> has

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
battles digging deeper Dirk Leggett has

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.929 
battles digging deeper Dirk Leggett has
the<00:01:09.799> facts<00:01:10.900> so<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.920> most<00:01:13.250> efficient<00:01:13.700> approach

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
the facts so the most efficient approach

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.920 
the facts so the most efficient approach
is<00:01:14.299> that<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.630> player<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.770> able<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.159> build

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
is that the player is able to build

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.469 
is that the player is able to build
military<00:01:17.930> structures<00:01:18.650> like<00:01:19.310> encampments<00:01:20.240> and

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
military structures like encampments and

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.960 
military structures like encampments and
then<00:01:20.899> he<00:01:21.229> can<00:01:21.409> give<00:01:21.619> them<00:01:21.920> those<00:01:22.430> encampment

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
then he can give them those encampment

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.580 
then he can give them those encampment
strategic<00:01:23.390> orders<00:01:23.750> like<00:01:24.399> attack<00:01:25.399> opponents

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
strategic orders like attack opponents

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.719 
strategic orders like attack opponents
break<00:01:27.590> down<00:01:27.860> walls<00:01:28.899> defend<00:01:29.899> yourself<00:01:30.700> go<00:01:31.700> to

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
break down walls defend yourself go to

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.880 
break down walls defend yourself go to
another<00:01:32.060> place<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.840> stuff<00:01:33.020> like<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.409> so

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
another place and stuff like that so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.020 
another place and stuff like that so
it's<00:01:34.070> more<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.310> strategic<00:01:35.469> level<00:01:36.469> and<00:01:36.950> not<00:01:37.850> so

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
it's more a strategic level and not so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.929 
it's more a strategic level and not so
much<00:01:38.149> technical<00:01:38.540> autos<00:01:38.960> for<00:01:39.579> single<00:01:40.579> units

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
much technical autos for single units

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.670 
much technical autos for single units
because<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.659> size<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.110> game<00:01:42.290> is<00:01:42.439> bigger

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
because the size of the game is bigger

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.249 
because the size of the game is bigger
and<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.759> scope<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.600> player<00:01:44.810> has<00:01:45.079> to<00:01:45.110> be

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
and so the scope of the player has to be

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.310 
and so the scope of the player has to be
bigger<00:01:45.500> too<00:01:46.090> now<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.149> know<00:01:47.600> what<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:47.930> need<00:01:48.140> to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
bigger too now we know what we need to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.590 
bigger too now we know what we need to
do<00:01:48.530> when<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.890> enemy<00:01:49.250> attacks<00:01:49.640> but<00:01:50.180> how<00:01:50.390> can

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
do when the enemy attacks but how can

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.440 
do when the enemy attacks but how can
you<00:01:50.719> protect<00:01:51.140> your<00:01:51.320> city<00:01:51.590> from<00:01:51.860> invaders

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
you protect your city from invaders

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.039 
you protect your city from invaders
