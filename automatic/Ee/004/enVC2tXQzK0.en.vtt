to your computer second really great
feature<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.000> tool<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.899> built-in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
feature of this tool is the built-in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
feature of this tool is the built-in
timer<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.969> time<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.449> silent

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
timer so this time we're silent

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.170 
timer so this time we're silent
basically<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.030> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
basically what it's going to do is it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
basically what it's going to do is it
will<00:00:54.270> vibrate<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.050> hand<00:00:55.230> when<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.710> have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
third powerful feature is the green

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.840 
third powerful feature is the green
laser<00:01:03.449> pointer<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:05.010> what's<00:01:05.309> special<00:01:05.460> about

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
laser pointer so what's special about

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
laser pointer so what's special about
this<00:01:06.210> laser<00:01:06.540> pointer<00:01:06.710> well<00:01:07.710> first<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> all

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this laser pointer well first of all

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.640 
this laser pointer well first of all
it's<00:01:08.369> nice<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.880> built-in<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:10.170> second

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it's nice that it's built-in but second

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's nice that it's built-in but second
of<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.070> color<00:01:11.369> makes<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> special<00:01:12.450> green

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of all the color makes it special green

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
of all the color makes it special green
actually<00:01:13.920> has<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> higher<00:01:14.460> frequency<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:15.270> red

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
actually has a higher frequency than red

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.140 
actually has a higher frequency than red
which<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.680> most<00:01:16.860> common<00:01:17.369> color<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.909> laser

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
which is the most common color for laser

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.170 
which is the most common color for laser
pointers<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> higher<00:01:20.070> frequency<00:01:20.850> makes

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
pointers and the higher frequency makes

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
pointers and the higher frequency makes
it<00:01:21.330> easier<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.560> red<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.280> your

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it easier to see than red so your

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
it easier to see than red so your
audience<00:01:23.880> members<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.600> able<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.020> see

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
audience members will be able to see

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
audience members will be able to see
your<00:01:25.409> green<00:01:25.710> light<00:01:25.950> better<00:01:26.490> than<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:26.970> would

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
your green light better than they would

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.140 
your green light better than they would

little<00:01:40.560> remote<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> also<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> few<00:01:42.000> more<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
little remote and also a few more of the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 
little remote and also a few more of the
features<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:44.070> first<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:44.729> do

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
features so the first thing you will do

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
features so the first thing you will do
is<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.869> remove<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.470> arrow

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is you're going to remove this arrow

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
is you're going to remove this arrow
right<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.670> activates<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> triple-a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
right here that activates the triple-a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499 
right here that activates the triple-a
batteries<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.590> come<00:01:49.799> included<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:51.090> second

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
batteries that come included the second

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.450 
batteries that come included the second
step<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.140> insert<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.890> flash<00:01:53.130> drive

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
step will be to insert the flash drive
