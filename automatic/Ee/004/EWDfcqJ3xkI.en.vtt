profitability<00:00:56.580> so<00:00:58.370> how<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> process

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
completely works start to finish is the

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.070 
completely works start to finish is the
cow<00:01:02.729> needs<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.269> baby<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.780> order<00:01:03.989> to

cow needs to have a baby in order to
give<00:01:04.229> milk<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.129> she'll<00:01:05.370> have<00:01:05.519> her<00:01:05.670> baby

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
give milk and so she'll have her baby

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
give milk and so she'll have her baby
that<00:01:06.150> baby's<00:01:06.630> gonna<00:01:06.720> stay<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> mother

industry

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.889 

there's<00:01:57.670> very<00:01:57.909> few<00:01:58.000> places<00:01:58.390> on<00:01:58.689> this<00:01:58.840> planet

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
there's very few places on this planet

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.109 
there's very few places on this planet
that<00:01:59.380> have<00:01:59.680> this<00:01:59.979> type<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.250> environment<00:02:00.970> but

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
that have this type of environment but

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.210 
that have this type of environment but
the<00:02:01.570> demand<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:02.020> dairy<00:02:02.320> based<00:02:02.530> protein<00:02:02.950> in<00:02:03.159> the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
the demand on dairy based protein in the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.920 
the demand on dairy based protein in the
world<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.729> only<00:02:03.880> going<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.240> increase<00:02:04.540> and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
world is only going to increase and

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.050 
world is only going to increase and
there's<00:02:05.530> not<00:02:05.649> enough<00:02:05.979> land<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.549> planet<00:02:06.939> to

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
there's not enough land on the planet to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.169 
there's not enough land on the planet to
do<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.479> type<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.869> daring<00:02:08.849> around<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:10.000> world

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
do this type of daring around the world

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.589 
do this type of daring around the world
it's<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.770> environment<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.910> not<00:02:13.239> going

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
it's just the environment is not going

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.790 
it's just the environment is not going
to<00:02:13.660> be<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.930> way<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> lands<00:02:14.349> are<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.530> there

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
to be that way the lands are not there

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.830 
to be that way the lands are not there
so<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.610> guess<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> global<00:02:16.420> scale<00:02:16.690> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
so I guess on a global scale a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.710 
so I guess on a global scale a
conclusion<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.709> dairy<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.340> not

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
conclusion of the dairy is not

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.370 
conclusion of the dairy is not
sustainable<00:02:21.480> unless<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.660> start<00:02:22.900> digging<00:02:23.319> up

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
sustainable unless we start digging up

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.690 
sustainable unless we start digging up
houses<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.950> putting<00:02:24.190> pastures<00:02:24.550> back<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:27.519> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
houses and putting pastures back and the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.160 
houses and putting pastures back and the
only<00:02:27.849> way<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.030> start<00:02:28.269> digging<00:02:28.510> up<00:02:28.569> houses<00:02:28.989> and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
only way to start digging up houses and

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.610 
only way to start digging up houses and
development<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.010> less<00:02:30.250> people<00:02:31.620> we

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
development is to have less people we

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.530 
development is to have less people we
only<00:02:32.830> know<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.640> know<00:02:33.700> population<00:02:34.450> is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
only know that you know population is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.830 
only know that you know population is
going<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.780> continue<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.260> grow<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.690> means

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
going to continue to grow so that means

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.140 
going to continue to grow so that means
more<00:02:38.080> commercial<00:02:38.560> dairy<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.010> sure<00:02:42.150> yeah

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
more commercial dairy and I'm sure yeah

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.580 
more commercial dairy and I'm sure yeah
where<00:02:43.330> some<00:02:43.569> other<00:02:43.720> products<00:02:44.110> gonna<00:02:44.230> take<00:02:44.440> its

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
where some other products gonna take its

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.710 
where some other products gonna take its
place<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:45.040> mean<00:02:45.190> we<00:02:45.400> see<00:02:45.849> there<00:02:46.090> certain<00:02:46.420> all

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
place I mean we see there certain all

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.080 
place I mean we see there certain all
sorts<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.980> know<00:02:48.010> soy<00:02:48.220> milks<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.790> almond

sorts of you know soy milks and almond
milk<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.750> lot<00:02:50.080> of<00:02:50.230> other<00:02:50.319> products<00:02:50.799> that

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
milk and a lot of other products that

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.550 
milk and a lot of other products that
are<00:02:51.099> coming<00:02:51.220> out<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.700> different<00:02:52.090> blends<00:02:52.560> you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
are coming out and different blends you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.930 
are coming out and different blends you
know<00:02:53.650> where<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:53.890> take<00:02:54.069> juices<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.790> in

know where you take juices and in

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.789 
know where you take juices and in
proteins<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.170> think<00:02:56.380> you'll<00:02:56.500> see<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.650> lot

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
proteins and I think you'll see a lot

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.339 
proteins and I think you'll see a lot
more<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.190> he<00:02:57.880> was<00:02:58.120> right<00:02:58.450> how<00:02:58.959> could

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
more of that he was right how could

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.500 
more of that he was right how could
cow's<00:02:59.590> milk<00:02:59.830> be<00:03:00.069> sustainable<00:03:00.730> for<00:03:01.120> when<00:03:01.239> one

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
cow's milk be sustainable for when one

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.360 
cow's milk be sustainable for when one
gallon<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.989> milk<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.500> takes<00:03:02.709> upwards<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.280> a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
gallon of milk it takes upwards of a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.109 
gallon of milk it takes upwards of a
