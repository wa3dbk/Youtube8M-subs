 the aip jorge rocha 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.270
 it is 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.020
 the bug 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.190
 it's good 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.890
 hello friends facebook - the channel 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.130
 exercise science at your fingertips 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.130
 the theme of our video at number 3 is 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.309
 exercise is before or after bodybuilding 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.739
 what science has to say well 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.930
 adaptive characteristics typical of the 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.780
 high intensity training 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.090
 weight including increased mass 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.570
 muscle and muscle strength 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.670
 these adaptations occurs through the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.490
 of acatei in C of 70 is 6k resulting in 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.190
 increased rate of protein synthesis by 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.750
 other side active aerobic training 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.620
 via the impeccable 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.780
 kenny and tops the downstream waterfall 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.070
 resulting in a decrease in the rate of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.680
 protein synthesis 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.470
 It is important to remember that these 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.619
 are also modulated in response to a 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.770
 variety of destinations including stress 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.979
 mechanical nutritional status factors 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.909
 growth and hormones to talk about 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.119
 this theme 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.409
 I present the article entitled The Order 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.219
 of aerobic exercise 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.319
 in relation to resistance exercise 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:30.049
 modifies the signal from A to EMI and 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:32.659
 to protect this feat was 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.109
 published November 2014 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.359
 the goal is to investigate whether the order of 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:41.539
 endurance exercise with the new one 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:45.109
 relation to the existed exercise affects 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.200
 content in tops the stream cascade 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:53.179
 for this they evaluate the concentrations 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:57.560
 of already doing so ina purity the content 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:00.920
 protected from n torÃ³ and 70s ska p 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.679
 the flawless promise of groth and the rate of 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.349
 protein synthesis 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.610
 we can observe in the table and that both 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:13.069
 concentrations of gf1 and insulin did not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.530
 changed in relation to the exercise order 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.500
 aerobic 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.500
 in the graph we observed that the force of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.170
 prayer was increased in the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.190
 group that performed an aerobic exercise 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.270
 The 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.270
 after resistance exercise 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.590
 we can see in graph b that the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.590
 pc 76 formation has increased 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.560
 regardless of the order of the exercises 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.770
 however, this increase was lower in the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.340
 group that performed an aerobic exercise 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.350
 after exercise compared to resist 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.780
 five-corner rate 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.540
 we observed that this was three times greater 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.230
 in the group that performed the exercise 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.870
 Aerobic exercise before the resist 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.570
 from a practical point of view when 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.710
 exercise is carried out after the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.670
 bodybuilding 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.210
 observe whether a force in relation to the outlet 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.330
 on pc try six cars driving in a 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.990
 lower rate of school anabolic or 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.410
 whether this article opens up more points for 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.230
 a discussion because we must consider the 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.080
 training objective and the variables 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.000
 training with an aptitude level 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.910
 physical status nutritional intensity and 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.130
 training volume 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.110
 never forget here is said is 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.120
 fundamentally the orientation of a 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.200
 professional physical education and 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.380
 nutritionists 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.020
 Thank you very much, facebook friends and even 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.500
 the next exercise science to your 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.500
