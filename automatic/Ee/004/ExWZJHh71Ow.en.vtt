how yellow the yellow part is now you're
probably<00:00:57.000> thinking<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.930> free-range<00:00:58.350> eggs

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
probably thinking but free-range eggs

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.310

are<00:00:58.920> expensive<00:00:59.120> yes<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.390> true<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:00.989> cost

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
are expensive yes it's true they do cost

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.979 
are expensive yes it's true they do cost
about<00:01:01.620> fifty<00:01:01.829> percent<00:01:02.309> more<00:01:02.609> than<00:01:03.239> regular

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
about fifty percent more than regular

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
about fifty percent more than regular
eggs<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> break<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
eggs but when you break it down to the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
eggs but when you break it down to the
actual<00:01:06.689> figures<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> comes<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.770> about

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
actual figures it comes out to be about

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.789 
actual figures it comes out to be about
a<00:01:08.369> dollar<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> dollar<00:01:09.330> fifty<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:10.049> per

you're getting healthier fatty acids
overall<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.560> highly<00:01:26.130> recommend<00:01:26.540> free-range

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
overall I highly recommend free-range

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.069 
overall I highly recommend free-range
eggs<00:01:28.430> already<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> bills<00:01:30.810> for

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
eggs already and now on to the bills for

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.010 
eggs already and now on to the bills for
my<00:01:31.950> primary<00:01:32.400> attack<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.000> using<00:01:33.299> fists<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
my primary attack I'm using fists of

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
my primary attack I'm using fists of
thunder<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.400> quickening<00:01:35.880> ruin<00:01:36.210> which

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
thunder with the quickening ruin which

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.990 
thunder with the quickening ruin which
generates<00:01:37.470> 15<00:01:37.920> spirit<00:01:38.310> every<00:01:38.520> time<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> quit

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
generates 15 spirit every time you quit

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
generates 15 spirit every time you quit
and<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.659> believe<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.140> build<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.799> skill<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and I believe this build the skill is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.490 
and I believe this build the skill is
bug<00:01:41.400> right<00:01:41.640> now<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.210> any<00:01:42.810> skill<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
bug right now because any skill that you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
bug right now because any skill that you
use<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.829> crits<00:01:44.369> gives<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> fifteen

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
use that crits gives you that fifteen

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
use that crits gives you that fifteen
percent<00:01:45.720> spirit<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.920> essentially<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> have
