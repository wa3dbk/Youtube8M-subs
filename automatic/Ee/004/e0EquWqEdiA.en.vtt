it<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.360> gonna<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.730> regular

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it was just gonna be like a regular

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.720 
it was just gonna be like a regular
thing<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.360> nachos<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.020> damn<00:00:40.890> that's<00:00:41.430> pretty

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
thing of nachos but damn that's pretty

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.560 
thing of nachos but damn that's pretty
freaking<00:00:42.120> big<00:00:42.270> right<00:00:42.480> there<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.860> was<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.570> six

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
freaking big right there it was a six

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.330 
freaking big right there it was a six
dollars<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> fifty<00:00:46.379> cents<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> nachos

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
dollars and fifty cents for the nachos

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
dollars and fifty cents for the nachos
well<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.440> that's<00:00:49.590> like
