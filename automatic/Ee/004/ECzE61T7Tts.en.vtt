00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 so I thought I'll do it 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 short tutorial about how to join 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.920
 native instruments the studio drummer 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.660
 to do this multi channel and indeed 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.539
 the x 8 usd million and 80 tracks has 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.689
 I have somehow 216 stereo 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.980
 but get this 88 fall card 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.449
 the 80 tracks 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.920
 I've never attempt it 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.570
 Today I did it and thought 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 me hey maybe there is somewhere 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 But someone out there not been the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.890
 and I show that now how 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.890
 it works 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.800
 because at native on the page is there 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.750
 Although also how to bleed the channels 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.440
 but still stereotyped but what if 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.450
 man's imo has a youtube tutorial 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.270
 I found that explained too 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.469
 and there it was totally 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.329
 to understand but even with me has 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.449
 that also did not work now 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.879
 I get away and think about sports free 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.859
 I'll show you how maybe yes 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.350
 but one or the other of the one or the other 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 others have not 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.689
 shirred and I can help now 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.330
 So in the case 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.270
 we have a normal one here now 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.729
 Software instrument track and we choose 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 now here is our studio from the rhine 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.670
 instruments native instruments contact 5 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.320
 and dania multi output eight times stereo 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.659
 mono eight times and then it opens 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.909
 window with the preset there you have here 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.829
 front now once stereo two matter 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.130
 and once the surround track that benefits 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.619
 nothing we want 8 series 8 - 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:47.759
 that means we are going to channels here now 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.189
 say here at conti 8 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.000
 that means eight tracks number of channels 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.810
 means 2 in the case stereo 1 throw mono 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 and daniel soundcard death would be the eu 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.259
 1 and then come the tec systems 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.820
 now the first time since the tick 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.860
 pure that the old ones are gone and the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.870
 new ones are there 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 zack we have eight stereo tracks and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.540
 now the big question how do we get 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.760
 the mono tracks and that with me like 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.110
 it can also follow that with others 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.220
 I work differently now 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.440
 found out 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.790
 that's how it works for me and I am 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:33.640
 totally happy that after years of testing 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.350
 So no matter what, then we tell again 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.590
 eight tracks and this time number of 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.280
 channels 1 dennis become mono tracks and 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.190
 sound card autopia and here is the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.260
 ask which next to me and in the case 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:54.140
 I tried this time with aux four 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.870
 days this time the existing tracks the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.130
 both of us as no check in here 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:04.100
 say okay and we have the tracks in 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.200
 the case that works now 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.500
 in stereo is always the bottom of the output 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.810
 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 15 16 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.209
 and then it goes at 17 18 19 with the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.640
 motto tracks continue 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.019
 and now we can do the studio drummer 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.970
 Open loaded there a kit pure and 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.330
 tell now that for safety 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.459
 the one who is dead again in advance 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.970
 the new settings up here on the 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.130
 exclamation mark again click on it 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.390
 then you see it again purely as that 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.380
 enough click once and then he has 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.230
 that and then we can do it here in the mixer 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.030
 say kick for example here and still 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.940
 settings and you are now my output 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 mono 9 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.350
 you are the disney here settings output 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.350
 mono 10 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.220
 as well then here on the eleven the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.380
 fantastic depending on how you want 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.799
 over het stereo in that case we can 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.810
 now put a stereo 2 from the eu 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.850
 you can go back to a mono track 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.400
 which is still free becomes a profession 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.349
 16 depending on you can you by the way 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.530
 number down here too if I am now 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.530
 up here 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.669
 days the eu 1 is now receives the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.939
 So boy can be here again 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.830
 that's what makes it so and already packed that 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:41.620
 young farmer it is like doing everywhere 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:44.099
 for example, mono 9 is already the one 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.099
 Has 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.650
 okay you can do that here with all these 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.189
 Traces of biscuits are approaching as well 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.009
 always and up here only at the buses 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:59.650
 You can not bleed that rework 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:03.840
 it always stays that way on the master 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.250
 means on stereo 12 here 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.219
 and how does it work in the mixer now ? 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.770
 from logic for example there you go now 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.539
 just on it 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.120
 I grab that time to the side 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:20.740
 you do not see anymore now 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.469
 down here in the mixer we have it here 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.389
 down this little plus on the trail 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.150
 and there now always gets that out 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.949
 all traces are there and you see 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.699
 already here at the beginning made the stereo 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.710
 traces 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.199
 and here he comes with sometime 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.310
 the mono tracks 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.509
 and if I want it now 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.400
 contact again 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.969
 if I am here for example now 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.440
 just let this call play and 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:49.120
 I'm just doing this number 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.889
 closer to solo then we see in here 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.110
 mixer i had contact once again 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:57.990
 away because it so it we have closer 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:02.650
 now here on mono 10 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.870
 that would be the case here as well 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.469
 my mono track but what you here 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.180
 forward in the ever so stereo channel you 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.569
 is the masters signal as i once again 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.729
 mild 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.300
 there would be only the room on it what 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.740
 I will say to you 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.569
 and so it goes on then so then 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:29.310
 Could I also learn this here? 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.310
 you edit whatever I want 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:39.699
 all this for the channel so easy 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:41.619
 that is totally simple, I 'm glad 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.360
 that did not work out if you still 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:46.300
 have questions or somewhere at one 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.729
 do not get ahead so I am 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.369
 now no contact player expert 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.990
 I took forever to reach 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:55.029
 but if you are something you can 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.129
 the routing or writes then 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.839
 just below in the comments with 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.099
 Come in and I'll try you 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:02.099
 answer ok
