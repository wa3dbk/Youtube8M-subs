00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
today is a super windy day at the park

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.180 
today is a super windy day at the park
and<00:00:12.299> I'm<00:00:12.420> doing<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.869> maiden<00:00:13.260> flight<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:14.010> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and I'm doing the maiden flight for the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.600 
and I'm doing the maiden flight for the
flare<00:00:14.430> magnet<00:00:14.879> illa<00:00:15.199> spread<00:00:16.199> spilled<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
flare magnet illa spread spilled out of

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:26.090 
flare magnet illa spread spilled out of
atoms<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:24.110> sure<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.620> very<00:00:25.860> good<00:00:26.010> idea

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
atoms for sure is not a very good idea

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.240 
atoms for sure is not a very good idea
to<00:00:26.430> try<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.060> brand<00:00:27.420> new<00:00:27.480> plane<00:00:27.890> scratch<00:00:28.890> built

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
to try a brand new plane scratch built

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.360 
to try a brand new plane scratch built
to<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:31.230> very<00:00:31.470> first<00:00:31.740> time<00:00:31.950> in<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> windy<00:00:32.610> day

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
to the very first time in a windy day

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:43.520 
to the very first time in a windy day
but<00:00:40.550> since<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.699> are<00:00:41.730> pilots<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> fly

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
but since we are pilots we have to fly

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.939 
but since we are pilots we have to fly
no<00:00:44.100> matter<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.550> conditions<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.949> so

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
no matter what conditions they are so

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.829 
no matter what conditions they are so
here<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.339> trying<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:47.999> the<00:00:48.120> grass<00:00:48.359> to<00:00:48.659> do<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
here I'm trying it in the grass to do a

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:55.790 
here I'm trying it in the grass to do a
little<00:00:49.249> run<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:53.539> here<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.499> first

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
little run and here we go with the first

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.069 
little run and here we go with the first
flight<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:57.329> choppy<00:00:57.809> oops

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
flight a little choppy oops

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:15.870 
flight a little choppy oops
super<00:01:01.079> bumpy<00:01:02.359> but<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.479> plane<00:01:03.749> flies<00:01:04.110> well

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.400 

it<00:01:16.880> sure<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.510> they<00:01:17.630> mentor<00:01:17.990> all<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.260> the

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
it sure is that they mentor all of the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.900 
it sure is that they mentor all of the
skills<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.979> put<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.520> floor<00:01:19.729> like<00:01:19.940> that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
skills to put it in the floor like that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.750 
skills to put it in the floor like that
the<00:01:22.910> motor<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.450> have<00:01:23.750> here<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:25.550> one

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
the motor that I have here is the one

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.780 
the motor that I have here is the one
from<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.210> parks<00:01:26.570> own<00:01:26.780> Stinson<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:27.790> I'm

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
from the parks own Stinson and I'm

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:46.200 
from the parks own Stinson and I'm
flying<00:01:29.090> at<00:01:29.390> 2200<00:01:30.350> mineable<00:01:31.030> 3-cell<00:01:32.030> battery

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.880 

and<00:01:47.210> since<00:01:47.570> we're<00:01:47.750> here<00:01:48.050> we<00:01:48.470> might<00:01:48.680> as<00:01:48.740> well

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
and since we're here we might as well

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.710 
and since we're here we might as well
keep<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:49.550> flying<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:50.060> for<00:01:50.300> a<00:01:50.330> little<00:01:50.600> bit

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
keep in flying it for a little bit

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:08.760 
keep in flying it for a little bit
longer

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:33.290 

the<00:02:09.770> wind<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.300> 15<00:02:11.300> miles<00:02:11.600> per<00:02:11.840> hour<00:02:12.459> gusting<00:02:13.459> 26

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
no fancy flying just keeping her on the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:51.260 
no fancy flying just keeping her on the
air<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:40.650> nice<00:02:40.830> actually<00:02:50.210> so<00:02:51.210> you
