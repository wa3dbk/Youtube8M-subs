00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.769 

the<00:00:29.250> vines<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.090> been<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the vines there have been there the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.510 
the vines there have been there the
building's<00:00:31.170> been<00:00:31.289> there<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> while<00:00:31.800> binder

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
building's been there for a while binder

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
building's been there for a while binder
or<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.030> design<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> thought<00:00:33.780> I'd<00:00:33.899> put<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
or just design I thought I'd put like a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
or just design I thought I'd put like a
little<00:00:34.590> bit<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> vine<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> corner<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.390> see

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
little bit of vine on the corner to see

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.540 
little bit of vine on the corner to see
what<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.780> would<00:00:36.840> look<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.399> looks

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
what it would look like and it looks

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.319 
what it would look like and it looks
kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> weird<00:00:38.850> because<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:41.329> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
kind of weird because it's not like the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.340 
kind of weird because it's not like the
vines<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.690> been<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.079> while<00:00:43.140> so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
vines have been there for a while so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.830 
vines have been there for a while so
they<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> way<00:00:44.070> down<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.879> they

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
they go all the way down right they

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.729 
they go all the way down right they
really<00:00:46.020> shouldn't<00:00:47.239> be<00:00:48.239> more<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.989> don't

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
really shouldn't be more like I don't

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:02.869 
really shouldn't be more like I don't
know<00:00:54.140> like<00:00:56.420> that<00:01:01.190> but<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.309> again<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.579> do

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
know like that but then again you do

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.600 
know like that but then again you do
have<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> cap<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:04.110> kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> defeats<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
have the cap which kind of defeats the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.350 
have the cap which kind of defeats the
purpose<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> top<00:01:08.100> part<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.430> defeats

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
purpose the top part here defeats

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.280 
purpose the top part here defeats
purpose<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.900> doesn't<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
purpose because it doesn't go all the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
purpose because it doesn't go all the
way<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.680> anyway<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.979> doesn't<00:01:11.159> matter

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
way up it up anyway it doesn't matter

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.490 
way up it up anyway it doesn't matter
let's<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> inside<00:01:12.150> post<00:01:12.990> office<00:01:13.350> so

trucks<00:05:11.180> are<00:05:11.419> coming<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.960> initially<00:05:12.290> close<00:05:12.590> to

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
trucks are coming to initially close to

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.550 
trucks are coming to initially close to
the<00:05:12.860> edge<00:05:13.419> if<00:05:14.419> they<00:05:14.750> fell<00:05:14.960> in<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.169> would<00:05:15.470> be

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
bad but I guess that's so far they

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.010 
bad but I guess that's so far they
haven't<00:05:20.000> so<00:05:20.270> that's<00:05:20.720> good<00:05:20.960> I<00:05:22.600> do<00:05:23.600> kind<00:05:23.870> of<00:05:23.900> like
