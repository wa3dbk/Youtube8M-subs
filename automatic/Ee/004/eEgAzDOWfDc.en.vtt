lost Elena I think had some hopes that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.210 
lost Elena I think had some hopes that
when<00:01:33.810> school<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.380> school<00:01:34.649> came<00:01:34.830> back<00:01:35.009> around

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
when school when school came back around

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
when school when school came back around
they<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.090> find<00:01:36.450> themselves

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.180 
again but here this new guy shows up and
he's<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.539> captain<00:01:40.080> cool<00:01:40.319> he<00:01:40.740> dresses

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
cool is real slick and I think just in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.889 
cool is real slick and I think just in
general<00:01:44.300> that's<00:01:45.300> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.539> like<00:01:45.630> who<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
general that's kind of like who do you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.240 
general that's kind of like who do you
think<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.170> are

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.490 

thing<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.750> Vicki's<00:01:53.750> been<00:01:53.900> kind<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.200> known<00:01:54.470> for

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
thing is Vicki's been kind of known for

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.640 
thing is Vicki's been kind of known for
like<00:01:54.920> her<00:01:55.250> partying<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.060> her<00:01:56.750> rough<00:01:57.020> ways<00:01:57.320> and

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
like her partying and her rough ways and

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.240 
like her partying and her rough ways and
so<00:01:57.800> I<00:01:57.830> think<00:01:58.330> Matt<00:01:59.330> does<00:01:59.630> maybe<00:02:00.070> have<00:02:01.070> some

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
so I think Matt does maybe have some

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.830 
so I think Matt does maybe have some
suspicions<00:02:01.760> about<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.120> too<00:02:02.330> but<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:02.570> think<00:02:02.780> he

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
suspicions about that too but I think he

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.960 
suspicions about that too but I think he
kind<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.050> overlooks<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.620> too<00:02:03.800> just<00:02:04.760> like

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
kind of overlooks it too just like

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.650 
kind of overlooks it too just like
gothic<00:02:05.660> they're<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:06.740> messed<00:02:07.040> up<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:08.270> wasn't
