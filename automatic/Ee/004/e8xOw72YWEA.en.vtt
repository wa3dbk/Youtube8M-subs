00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.940 
wanted you can just send it to me I
could<00:05:27.030> have<00:05:27.630> somebody<00:05:27.870> throw<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.680> in<00:05:28.800> there

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
could have somebody throw it in there

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.040 
could have somebody throw it in there
for<00:05:28.980> probably<00:05:29.460> 30<00:05:30.030> 40<00:05:30.330> bucks<00:05:30.600> something<00:05:30.930> like

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
for probably 30 40 bucks something like

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.660 
for probably 30 40 bucks something like
that<00:05:31.290> I<00:05:31.320> would<00:05:31.560> guess<00:05:31.770> maybe<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.400> little<00:05:32.490> bit

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
that I would guess maybe a little bit

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.129 
that I would guess maybe a little bit
more<00:05:32.880> but<00:05:33.690> nothing<00:05:34.110> too<00:05:34.230> excessive

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.279 

turns<00:05:38.740> on<00:05:39.009> works<00:05:39.550> like<00:05:39.759> it<00:05:39.879> should<00:05:40.479> I'm<00:05:41.080> sure

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
turns on works like it should I'm sure

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.260 
turns on works like it should I'm sure
the<00:05:41.470> EDC<00:05:41.680> needs<00:05:42.039> to<00:05:42.159> be<00:05:42.310> recharged<00:05:42.879> but<00:05:43.090> it's

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
the EDC needs to be recharged but it's

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.629 
the EDC needs to be recharged but it's
been<00:05:43.419> cold<00:05:43.690> around<00:05:43.990> here<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:44.560> it<00:05:45.190> feels<00:05:45.490> like

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
been cold around here so it feels like

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.159 
been cold around here so it feels like
it's<00:05:45.879> pushing<00:05:46.210> cold<00:05:46.419> out<00:05:46.659> and<00:05:46.690> I'm<00:05:46.870> sure<00:05:47.050> it's

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
it's pushing cold out and I'm sure it's

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.570 
it's pushing cold out and I'm sure it's
just<00:05:47.229> the<00:05:47.379> outside<00:05:47.800> temperature

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.210 

like<00:05:51.580> I<00:05:51.699> said<00:05:51.759> runs<00:05:52.240> nice<00:05:52.509> and<00:05:52.750> smooth<00:05:53.220> pulls

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
like I said runs nice and smooth pulls

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.830 
like I said runs nice and smooth pulls
the<00:05:54.400> right<00:05:54.550> amount<00:05:54.819> of<00:05:54.879> air<00:05:55.060> pressure<00:05:57.840> 910,000

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
the right amount of air pressure 910,000

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.440 
the right amount of air pressure 910,000
on<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.110> one<00:06:00.690> bolts<00:06:01.690> are<00:06:01.840> good

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.640 

oil<00:06:04.990> pressure<00:06:05.260> goes<00:06:05.590> right<00:06:05.950> up<00:06:06.960> it<00:06:07.960> drops<00:06:08.380> off

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
oil pressure goes right up it drops off

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.410 
oil pressure goes right up it drops off
and<00:06:08.860> it<00:06:08.980> stays<00:06:09.190> steady<00:06:09.520> when<00:06:09.790> it<00:06:09.880> goes<00:06:10.000> back<00:06:10.240> to

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
and it stays steady when it goes back to

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.100 
and it stays steady when it goes back to
idle<00:06:12.180> temperatures<00:06:13.180> just<00:06:13.510> starting<00:06:13.870> to<00:06:13.900> come

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
idle temperatures just starting to come

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.550 
idle temperatures just starting to come
up<00:06:14.260> to<00:06:14.470> about<00:06:14.650> 105<00:06:15.460> so<00:06:16.120> a<00:06:16.150> bit<00:06:16.870> of<00:06:16.900> ways<00:06:17.140> to<00:06:17.410> go

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
up to about 105 so a bit of ways to go

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:27.560 
up to about 105 so a bit of ways to go
though

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.810

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
like I said glass and this one's in good

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.630 
like I said glass and this one's in good
shape<00:06:30.090> a<00:06:30.390> little<00:06:31.170> tiny<00:06:31.500> chip<00:06:32.100> there<00:06:32.370> you<00:06:32.520> go

shape a little tiny chip there you go

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.590 
shape a little tiny chip there you go
you<00:06:32.910> can<00:06:32.940> see<00:06:33.210> right<00:06:33.630> there<00:06:34.100> very<00:06:35.100> small<00:06:35.610> but

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
you can see right there very small but

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.190 
you can see right there very small but

good job on it clean up very very well
let's<00:07:29.270> show<00:07:29.510> you<00:07:29.600> what<00:07:29.720> I<00:07:29.750> was<00:07:29.840> talking<00:07:30.200> about

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.260 
let's show you what I was talking about

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.900 
let's show you what I was talking about
the<00:07:30.500> clutch<00:07:31.180> pushing<00:07:32.180> in<00:07:32.300> once<00:07:33.370> now<00:07:34.370> went<00:07:34.670> into

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 
the clutch pushing in once now went into

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.150 
the clutch pushing in once now went into
gear<00:07:35.120> so<00:07:35.870> it's<00:07:36.320> going<00:07:36.470> in<00:07:36.620> figure<00:07:36.860> all<00:07:37.010> right

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 
gear so it's going in figure all right

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.310 
gear so it's going in figure all right
once<00:07:37.400> it<00:07:37.550> warms<00:07:37.670> up<00:07:37.970> release<00:07:38.810> it<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.140> push<00:07:39.290> it

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.320 
once it warms up release it and push it

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.130 
once it warms up release it and push it
down<00:07:39.440> again<00:07:40.180> yeah<00:07:41.180> see<00:07:41.450> it<00:07:41.570> seems<00:07:41.750> like<00:07:41.960> once

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.140 
down again yeah see it seems like once

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.770 
down again yeah see it seems like once
it<00:07:42.320> warms<00:07:42.440> up<00:07:42.740> it's<00:07:42.950> alright<00:07:43.390> but<00:07:44.390> when<00:07:44.630> it's

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.780 
it warms up it's alright but when it's

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.510 
it warms up it's alright but when it's
cold<00:07:44.840> it's<00:07:45.290> hard<00:07:45.500> to<00:07:45.620> get<00:07:45.770> it<00:07:45.920> into<00:07:46.040> the<00:07:46.280> first

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 
cold it's hard to get it into the first

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.120 
cold it's hard to get it into the first
you<00:07:46.850> know<00:07:46.940> first<00:07:47.210> gear<00:07:47.480> and<00:07:47.510> then<00:07:47.690> reverse<00:07:51.130> hey

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.130 
you know first gear and then reverse hey

00:07:52.130 --> 00:08:05.540 
you know first gear and then reverse hey
I<00:07:52.160> see<00:07:52.430> it<00:07:52.520> look
