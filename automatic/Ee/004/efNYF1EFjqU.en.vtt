it's<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:12.930> common<00:04:13.560> sense<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.730> mean<00:04:15.450> it's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
it's just common sense so I mean it's

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.270 
it's just common sense so I mean it's
curious<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.019> see<00:04:16.169> reason<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.560> go<00:04:16.739> with<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.100> I

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
curious to see reason to go with it I

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.920 
curious to see reason to go with it I
have<00:04:17.820> no<00:04:18.000> doubt<00:04:18.209> in<00:04:18.299> my<00:04:18.390> mind<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
have no doubt in my mind that the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.710 
have no doubt in my mind that the
superior<00:04:19.410> line<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.769> going<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.220> last<00:04:20.430> up<00:04:21.209> until

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
superior line is going to last up until

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.619 
superior line is going to last up until
next<00:04:22.019> year

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:22.629 
next year

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.270 
next year
when<00:04:23.629> amazing<00:04:24.259> spider-man<00:04:24.500> 2<00:04:24.710> gets<00:04:25.009> ready<00:04:25.220> to

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
when amazing spider-man 2 gets ready to

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.219 
when amazing spider-man 2 gets ready to
be<00:04:25.460> launched<00:04:25.819> and<00:04:26.120> they<00:04:26.539> will<00:04:26.750> probably<00:04:26.930> see

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
be launched and they will probably see

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.129 
be launched and they will probably see
the<00:04:27.259> rebirth<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:28.270> or<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.389> amazing<00:04:29.660> spider-man

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
the rebirth of or the amazing spider-man

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.140 
the rebirth of or the amazing spider-man
and<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.919> wouldn't<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.280> shock<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.759> me<00:04:31.940> the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
and it wouldn't be a shock to me the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.499 
and it wouldn't be a shock to me the
fact<00:04:32.449> that<00:04:32.569> um<00:04:33.009> they<00:04:34.009> keep<00:04:34.250> superior<00:04:34.849> around<00:04:35.180> -

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
fact that um they keep superior around -

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.689 
fact that um they keep superior around -
so<00:04:36.080> it'll<00:04:36.590> be<00:04:36.680> interesting<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.220> see<00:04:37.340> how<00:04:37.639> the

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
so it'll be interesting to see how the

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.029 
so it'll be interesting to see how the
story<00:04:38.180> progressed<00:04:38.569> up<00:04:38.750> until<00:04:39.259> next<00:04:39.440> year<00:04:39.800> I

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
story progressed up until next year I

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.249 
story progressed up until next year I
would<00:04:40.490> be<00:04:40.520> really<00:04:40.940> surprised<00:04:41.360> if<00:04:41.569> they<00:04:41.750> do<00:04:41.810> not

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
would be really surprised if they do not

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.110
