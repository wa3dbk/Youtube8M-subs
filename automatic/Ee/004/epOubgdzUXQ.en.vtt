glass or anything but you get really

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.860 
glass or anything but you get really
pretty<00:05:05.289> good<00:05:05.590> at<00:05:05.800> it<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.160> just<00:05:06.910> turn<00:05:07.630> your

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
pretty good at it and just turn your

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.820 
pretty good at it and just turn your
spoon<00:05:08.200> around<00:05:09.690> just<00:05:10.690> keep<00:05:10.930> stirring<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:13.830> I

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
spoon around just keep stirring and I

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.630 
spoon around just keep stirring and I
won't<00:05:15.370> get<00:05:15.580> it<00:05:15.700> as<00:05:15.940> nice<00:05:16.300> as<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.350> cap<00:05:17.710> glass<00:05:18.250> or

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
won't get it as nice as the cap glass or

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.570 
won't get it as nice as the cap glass or
stirring<00:05:19.419> it<00:05:19.710> because<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.770> don't<00:05:20.979> have<00:05:21.220> as<00:05:21.370> much

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
stirring it because I don't have as much

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.240 
stirring it because I don't have as much
room<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.330> can't<00:05:22.660> be<00:05:22.840> as<00:05:22.990> vigorous<00:05:23.350> with<00:05:24.010> the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
room and I can't be as vigorous with the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.610 
room and I can't be as vigorous with the
spoon<00:05:24.610> but<00:05:25.600> for<00:05:25.810> me<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:26.050> really<00:05:26.260> doesn't

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
spoon but for me it really doesn't

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.310 
spoon but for me it really doesn't
matter<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:27.250> just<00:05:27.430> am<00:05:28.150> trying<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.720> avoid<00:05:29.050> the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
matter I just am trying to avoid the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.850 
matter I just am trying to avoid the
mess<00:05:29.590> of<00:05:29.919> charcoal<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:31.680> what<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:32.710> will

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
mess of charcoal and what I will

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.890 
mess of charcoal and what I will
actually<00:05:33.490> do<00:05:33.669> as<00:05:33.880> soon<00:05:34.000> as<00:05:34.120> I'm<00:05:34.300> done<00:05:34.479> stirring

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
actually do as soon as I'm done stirring

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.460 
actually do as soon as I'm done stirring
it<00:05:35.820> I'm<00:05:36.820> going<00:05:37.450> to<00:05:37.510> lick<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.810> spoon<00:05:38.169> off<00:05:38.760> and

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
it I'm going to lick the spoon off and

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.390 
it I'm going to lick the spoon off and
so<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:42.180> won't<00:05:43.180> have<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.690> really<00:05:44.020> wash<00:05:45.010> it<00:05:45.250> with

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
so I won't have to really wash it with

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.159 
so I won't have to really wash it with
one<00:05:45.580> of<00:05:45.700> my<00:05:45.789> good<00:05:45.970> dish<00:05:46.240> right<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:46.870> I'll<00:05:46.960> just

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
one of my good dish right so I'll just

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:54.210 
one of my good dish right so I'll just
do<00:05:47.410> this<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:49.289> then<00:05:50.289> I<00:05:50.729> just<00:05:51.729> lick<00:05:51.910> it<00:05:51.940> off<00:05:53.220> okay

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
do this and then I just lick it off okay

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.440 
do this and then I just lick it off okay
get<00:05:54.610> it<00:05:54.700> really<00:05:54.850> nice<00:05:55.090> and<00:05:55.120> clean<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:57.490> then<00:05:58.389> I

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
get it really nice and clean and then I

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.040 
get it really nice and clean and then I
just<00:05:58.780> drink<00:05:59.050> it<00:05:59.200> back

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.740 

and<00:06:04.050> that's<00:06:04.530> it<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.950> can<00:06:05.340> add<00:06:05.490> more<00:06:05.730> water<00:06:06.540> to

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.660 
and that's it I can add more water to
get<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.170> last<00:06:07.380> bit<00:06:07.560> of<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.890> charcoal<00:06:08.340> which<00:06:08.550> I
