like apps and then just look for the
Facebook<00:01:59.040> app<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.270> has<00:02:00.509> six

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
Facebook app as you can see it has six

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.980 
Facebook app as you can see it has six
permissions<00:02:02.689> let's<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
permissions let's see so these are the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.760 
permissions let's see so these are the
permissions<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:08.640> was<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> trusted<00:02:09.509> app<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
permissions it was a trusted app but you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.580 
permissions it was a trusted app but you
know<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.310> whenever<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.480> trusted<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
know I I whenever the trusted the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.940 
know I I whenever the trusted the
check<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.760> checked<00:02:15.480> pretty<00:02:16.019> much<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
check is checked pretty much the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.860 
check is checked pretty much the
application<00:02:17.489> has<00:02:17.640> access<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.120> all<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
