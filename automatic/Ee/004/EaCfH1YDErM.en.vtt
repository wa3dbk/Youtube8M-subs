 anp 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.789
 in the area of ​​displays, 2013 was the year of the curved 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.519
 screen to see the two bent television and there are two bent sports fans 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.380
 announced 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.200
 and all those products came from the two companies 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.140
 samsung 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.640
 nl team and here belgium in amstelveen can play the net for first of all 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.930
 with vumc curved smartphone belgium 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 how to see flex 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.739
 kiev excesses 16 smartfone that 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.229
 a little big brothers from the title 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.099
 he was just a little bigger screen but was even looking for showers with a button 

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:05.099
 on the back because knowing the looks on it 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.090
 let's be honest that is of course not because who is fascinating because 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.310
 He is a big ground screen just like Day TV from LG 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.409
 according to lg it all has advantages so it would be great to have videos 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.250
 to look at this 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.200
 and for example if you 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.020
 It would be much more natural to call for a smooth phone 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.210
 looks more like the shape of an old-fashioned phone 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.980
 if that is really true 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.130
 I do not know I have added screen never really disturbed him 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.340
 not comfortable against my head 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.060
 as with sharing 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.229
 looking at images for job is very beautiful country is an oled panel this contrast is 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:38.650
 good 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.460
 but I also don't have the idea that comes in very much but it adds 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.660
 is terribly interesting because that is not a normal screen to see oled 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.160
 screen but there is no glass over one as we are used to was Marc van Schie 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.140
 must here paulette and plastic 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.049
 oled screen 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.659
 and that must be a lot of difference because you know a lot of people with glasses 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.920
 Telephones can handle it if drops fall more often or that are octagonal 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.659
 a thousand pieces and if your screen finished with plastic it suddenly becomes one 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.090
 you actually have a lot more robust 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.619
 much less chance of no chance 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.139
 that there is screen chest if you drop higher out 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.649
 Novum home in a while 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.759
 and besides that it is not only crooked, it is also finished outside 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.990
 order this phone in your back pocket 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.329
 who will sit in the chair 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.159
 No problem with the tube that you can simply put on the table, you can put the whole 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.049
 the neighbors you just see that he flex of foreign but your flex 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.390
 isci for made going 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.469
 who piece of it 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.389
 although a few user experience 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.819
 in my opinion and that short first impression does not add much 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.190
 he gives it a lot of new ones 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.239
 options making new things possible 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.719
 because the king of the screen is now limited address of the hardware as ie 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.159
 she says on that screen very well but the viewer play with the battery and 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.119
 with the circuit board 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.759
 but the screen could, for example, very well be used when smart becomes 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.489
 here comes a very nice round of wrist 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.530
 many possibilities in the field of form factors 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.859
 and they are very promising in the field 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.709
 of robustness of telephone screen 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.670
 the second big dirty from dji flex 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.000
 that is the back is just a plastic back was limits of l 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.700
 which smartphones but he has a special coating therefore opt for 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.290
 zeltiq 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.789
 self healing 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.679
 so a nano coating over it that is a bit midway between liquid and 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:14.250
 stuck 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.809
 and if you just have a little scratch on your phone 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.089
 that the loop finale codename bit in the courage to fill and so many small ones 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.429
 scratches have to get rid of themselves 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.440
 well that sounds very nice in practice 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.890
 but that part of the model was ever looked at then still had a lot of scratch 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.060
 of course, also used heavily that small scratches could quite be 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.530
 small surface scratches 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.499
 can already be eliminated but it doesn't look like this phone 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.539
 and give your pocket with a bunch of keys, for example, also survived 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.890
 I am not completely blown song flex 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.360
 and it is also not a perfect or a smartphone, he is six in the field 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.989
 first a little bit in nice product resolution is a bit low 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:51.990
 the backside 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.500
 that is not of the best quality in short it is not the best phone 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.129
 ever 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.029
 but is a very interesting phone 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.629
 and another reader who come with king it is a bit of a gimmick what 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.549
 I find it very interesting to see technology behind the screen that it does 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.329
 does not use glass the work plastic is finished and that is a piece 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.669
 more robust 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.189
 look from side each with typical large screen something nicer clothes that is 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.880
 all nice 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.670
 but a plastic screen that will break less quickly is a lot in practice 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.719
 useful and much revolutionary 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:23.100
 that jean flex goes it is certainly not a sales record as he speaks 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.470
 ever the Netherlands comes true he is full of courage innovation 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.150
 and shows that on the smart of market too long not developed 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:41.729
 evere me the wat
