00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and so you you really have to think

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.530 
and so you you really have to think
whether<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:44.069> want<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.879> whether

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
whether you really want it and whether

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.119 
whether you really want it and whether
you<00:02:45.690> really<00:02:45.840> want<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.170> build<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.500> walk<00:02:46.799> around

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
you really want to build it walk around

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.729 
you really want to build it walk around
like<00:02:47.250> roam<00:02:47.549> around<00:02:48.140> while<00:02:49.140> still<00:02:49.440> being<00:02:49.560> able

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
like roam around while still being able

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.030 
like roam around while still being able
to<00:02:49.889> use<00:02:50.190> your<00:02:50.489> you're<00:02:51.450> seriously<00:02:52.409> fast<00:02:52.650> 4G

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
to use your you're seriously fast 4G

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.420 
to use your you're seriously fast 4G
speeds<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.629> okay<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.659> know<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.889> 4G

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
speeds and and okay I know that the 4G

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.000 
speeds and and okay I know that the 4G
is<00:02:59.670> going<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.569> extremely<00:03:01.260> fast<00:03:01.590> time<00:03:01.889> it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
is going to be extremely fast time it

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.379 
is going to be extremely fast time it
does<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.639> is<00:03:02.879> really<00:03:03.299> fast<00:03:03.540> obsessed<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.230> how

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
does it is really fast obsessed and how

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.250 
does it is really fast obsessed and how
but<00:03:07.220> honestly<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.489> think<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:09.180> novelty<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
but honestly I think the novelty of the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.490 
but honestly I think the novelty of the
the<00:03:10.889> speed<00:03:11.190> will<00:03:12.090> wear<00:03:12.359> off<00:03:12.629> I<00:03:12.870> think<00:03:13.139> it<00:03:13.260> just

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the speed will wear off I think it just

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.839 
the speed will wear off I think it just
like<00:03:13.709> one<00:03:13.889> of<00:03:14.010> those<00:03:14.099> things<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.549> like<00:03:14.819> you

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
like one of those things that like you

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.629 
can say oh yeah I've got 4G on my ipod
but<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.569> think<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.079> thought<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:20.010> few<00:03:20.220> weeks<00:03:20.459> should

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.960 
I don't think that extra hundred pounds
of<00:04:29.580> dollars<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.150> worth<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.750> money<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.970> it

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
of dollars is worth the money and it

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.970 
of dollars is worth the money and it
might<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.510> some<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.930> out<00:04:34.080> there<00:04:34.110> it

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
might be to some of you out there it

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.860 
might be to some of you out there it
just<00:04:35.280> doesn't<00:04:35.580> really<00:04:35.670> appeal<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.060> me<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.660> I

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
just doesn't really appeal to me and I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.950 
just doesn't really appeal to me and I
don't<00:04:37.700> see<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.880> need<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.420> really<00:04:39.630> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
don't see the need and it really and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.600 
don't see the need and it really and
because<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:40.950> you<00:04:41.040> have<00:04:41.130> really<00:04:41.340> really

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
because if you have really really

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.460 
because if you have really really
serious<00:04:41.940> think<00:04:42.150> about<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.660> I'm<00:04:43.140> sure<00:04:43.200> you'll

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
serious think about it I'm sure you'll

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.220 
serious think about it I'm sure you'll
find<00:04:44.430> out<00:04:44.670> ways<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.390> can<00:04:45.570> get<00:04:45.720> around<00:04:45.810> it

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
find out ways that you can get around it

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.100 
find out ways that you can get around it
just<00:04:46.410> like<00:04:47.010> going<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.940> Wi-Fi<00:04:48.510> hotspot<00:04:48.810> or
