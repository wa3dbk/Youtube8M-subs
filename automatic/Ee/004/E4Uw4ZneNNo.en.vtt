in several suitcases I

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.960 
in several suitcases I
down<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.210> few<00:04:12.720> things<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.560> actually

down to a few things that I actually

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.740 
down to a few things that I actually
remember<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:16.110> feels<00:04:16.910> amazing<00:04:17.910> Lee

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
remember and it just feels amazing Lee

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.740 
remember and it just feels amazing Lee
light<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.190> think<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.580> this<00:04:20.730> is<00:04:20.790> directly

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
light and I think that this is directly

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.880 
light and I think that this is directly
directly<00:04:22.590> it's<00:04:23.130> really<00:04:23.670> trippy<00:04:24.240> how<00:04:24.890> we've

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
directly it's really trippy how we've

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.190 
directly it's really trippy how we've
done<00:04:26.160> all<00:04:26.520> kinds<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.910> external<00:04:27.660> cleansing

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
done all kinds of external cleansing

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.930 
done all kinds of external cleansing
while<00:04:28.470> we're<00:04:28.740> doing<00:04:28.920> this<00:04:29.190> internal

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
while we're doing this internal

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.750 
while we're doing this internal
cleansing<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.230> depth<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.070> internal

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
cleansing and the depth of the internal

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.660 
cleansing and the depth of the internal
cleansing<00:04:33.060> seems<00:04:34.050> directly<00:04:34.800> proportionate

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
cleansing seems directly proportionate

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.790 
cleansing seems directly proportionate
to<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.970> amount<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.510> external<00:04:37.050> cleansing

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
to the amount of external cleansing

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.360 
to the amount of external cleansing
we're<00:04:37.980> willing<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.490> do<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:38.940> really<00:04:39.210> distill

cleanse I these are the days today is

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.700 
cleanse I these are the days today is
supposed<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.270> be<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.720> most<00:05:39.900> intense<00:05:40.410> day

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
supposed to be the most intense day

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.340 
supposed to be the most intense day
along<00:05:41.040> with<00:05:41.070> yesterday<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:42.000> I<00:05:42.510> think<00:05:42.750> that<00:05:42.960> we

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
along with yesterday and I think that we

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.110 
along with yesterday and I think that we
can<00:05:43.530> both<00:05:43.770> agree<00:05:43.920> that<00:05:44.160> that's<00:05:44.430> true<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.030> I

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
can both agree that that's true and I

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.670 
can both agree that that's true and I
think<00:05:45.330> based<00:05:45.540> on<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.930> video<00:05:46.050> we<00:05:46.650> made

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
think based on the video we made

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.300 
think based on the video we made
yesterday<00:05:47.100> you<00:05:47.520> can<00:05:48.000> agree<00:05:48.270> that<00:05:48.540> that's<00:05:48.810> true

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
yesterday you can agree that that's true

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.720 
yesterday you can agree that that's true
so<00:05:51.140> we<00:05:52.140> highly<00:05:52.530> recommend<00:05:52.560> this<00:05:53.220> this<00:05:53.520> is<00:05:53.700> a

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
so we highly recommend this this is a

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.970 
so we highly recommend this this is a
really<00:05:54.300> incredible<00:05:54.600> thing<00:05:55.380> we<00:05:55.560> didn't<00:05:55.860> know
