00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.630 
my
the<00:01:52.110> way<00:01:52.230> that<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.560> might<00:01:52.740> layer<00:01:53.040> all<00:01:53.400> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the way that you might layer all the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.220 
the way that you might layer all the
pattern<00:01:53.970> dinnerware<00:01:54.330> together<00:01:54.660> would<00:01:55.140> be

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
pattern dinnerware together would be

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.360 
pattern dinnerware together would be
very<00:01:55.410> different<00:01:55.650> than<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.250> would

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
very different than the way that I would

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.670 
very different than the way that I would
and<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.120> can<00:01:57.390> find<00:01:57.660> your<00:01:57.840> own<00:01:58.020> unique<00:01:58.350> way

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and so you can find your own unique way

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.460

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
courtly check pattern rather and we

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.460 
courtly check pattern rather and we
printed<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.550> Belgium<00:03:50.550> linen

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
printed it on Belgium linen

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.070 
printed it on Belgium linen
and<00:03:51.560> I'm<00:03:51.800> so<00:03:52.100> I'm<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.760> excited<00:03:53.060> about<00:03:53.720> this

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
and I'm so I'm so excited about this

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.310 
and I'm so I'm so excited about this
because<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:55.220> factory<00:03:55.580> we<00:03:55.700> were<00:03:55.790> working<00:03:56.150> with

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
because the factory we were working with

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.020 
because the factory we were working with
found<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.500> way<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.710> just<00:03:58.190> create<00:03:58.400> literally

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
found a way to just create literally

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.120 
found a way to just create literally
every<00:03:59.480> brushed<00:03:59.780> brushstroke<00:04:00.470> me<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:00.980> the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
every brushed brushstroke me and the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.560 
every brushed brushstroke me and the
court<00:04:01.340> would<00:04:01.460> check<00:04:01.670> as<00:04:02.090> if<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.480> were

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
court would check as if it were

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.330 
court would check as if it were
hand-painted<00:04:02.960> but<00:04:03.350> it's<00:04:03.500> not<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:03.920> printed

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
hand-painted but it's not it's printed

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.860 
hand-painted but it's not it's printed
looks<00:04:04.640> hand-painted<00:04:05.000> isn't<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.480> something

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
looks hand-painted isn't it something

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.430 
looks hand-painted isn't it something
yes

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
yes

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.470 
yes
so<00:04:06.590> with<00:04:06.770> underpinnings<00:04:07.370> we<00:04:07.940> decided<00:04:08.390> it

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
so with underpinnings we decided it

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.970 
so with underpinnings we decided it
would<00:04:08.540> be<00:04:08.660> fun<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.020> mix<00:04:09.260> it<00:04:09.440> with<00:04:09.560> mattress

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
would be fun to mix it with mattress

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.520 
would be fun to mix it with mattress
sticking<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.520> the<00:04:11.030> word<00:04:11.180> underpinnings<00:04:11.870> it's

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
sticking and the word underpinnings it's

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.620 
sticking and the word underpinnings it's
interesting<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:13.130> means<00:04:13.310> foundation<00:04:14.060> or<00:04:14.330> just

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
interesting it means foundation or just

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.560 
interesting it means foundation or just
a<00:04:14.720> sort<00:04:14.960> of<00:04:15.020> basic<00:04:15.920> strong<00:04:16.850> structure<00:04:17.390> for

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
a sort of basic strong structure for

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.170 
a sort of basic strong structure for
something<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.230> so<00:04:18.739> for<00:04:19.430> Mackenzie<00:04:19.700> Child's

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
something and so for Mackenzie Child's

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.940 
something and so for Mackenzie Child's
underpinnings<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.959> way<00:04:21.170> of<00:04:21.200> bringing<00:04:21.530> black

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
underpinnings is a way of bringing black

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.260 
underpinnings is a way of bringing black
