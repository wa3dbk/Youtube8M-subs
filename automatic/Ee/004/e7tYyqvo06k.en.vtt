00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.950
 personal beauty 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.140
 the airplane model that is manufactured by 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.779
 We rent bikes with the partnership with 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.340
 The prince who produces our model is that I 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.960
 I'll explain to you about the 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.250
 opening the front where the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.500
 engine or compartment 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.199
 the compartment usually goes all 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.089
 they lower because due motor 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.800
 Needle needle function has motor that the 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.010
 needle position was rear has needles 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.390
 and the front has a needle that is well 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.690
 Vertical needle is more inclined 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.060
 equal to x 2 which are now produced in 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.980
 so if there is not one 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.770
 opening so big then we do is 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.420
 the smaller you go putting the engine and going 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.170
 make an adjustment according to your 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.960
 motor 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.090
 the judge to the lever of the awaited 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.560
 accelerator the adjustment paid in this house 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.030
 now it was back so you go 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.950
 scoring and going on the queue and going 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.350
 adjusting according to your engine 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.359
 good staff made a small fraction 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.090
 little bit here to achieve 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.619
 engine came in for me to start 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.789
 make the first 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:19.259
 the first markings of the cuts will 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.259
 each serve fitted a motor 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.679
 I'll make the first markings here. 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.460
 where I'm going to start doing the 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.200
 polite 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.749
 for now only make this cut here 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.060
 which is where the engine will fitting 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:33.249
 needle and we are marking with a 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.469
 where are you going to be using the next 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.570
 cut to make a full fit of the 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:47.040
 motor 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 It's the crowd as it was the assembly cut 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.730
 there finalized the installation of the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.550
 engine is a safe legal distance from the 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.680
 given from the motor fiber nothing 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.130
 either on the engine casing or on the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.720
 needle a distance is reasonable not to 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.820
 stay in the queue and not run the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.979
 risk of breaking needle guys if you 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 do not like our videos do not like below 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.330

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.670
 to record new tips and 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.630
 tricks for you is a big hug
