overdrive<00:00:57.930> pedal<00:00:59.060> it's<00:01:00.060> basically<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
overdrive pedal it's basically a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
overdrive pedal it's basically a
dumbbell<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.290> box<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.860> can<00:01:01.890> tell<00:01:02.220> by<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
dumbbell in a box as you can tell by the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
dumbbell in a box as you can tell by the

font and the name and the graphics and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.469 
font and the name and the graphics and
whatnot<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.430> already<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.910> a<00:01:06.120> dumbbell

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
whatnot and they already have a dumbbell

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.780 
whatnot and they already have a dumbbell
in<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> box<00:01:06.840> pedal<00:01:07.170> called<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.410> DM<00:01:07.740> BL<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
in a box pedal called the DM BL but this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
in a box pedal called the DM BL but this
is<00:01:08.940> basically<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.690> new<00:01:10.050> version<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.620> with<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is basically a new version of it with a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130 
is basically a new version of it with a
little<00:01:10.950> bit<00:01:11.130> more<00:01:11.310> gain<00:01:11.550> on<00:01:11.790> tap<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.930> more

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
little bit more gain on tap a lot more

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.890 
little bit more gain on tap a lot more
gain<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.560> tap<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.940> think<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> nails<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
gain on tap and I think it nails that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
gain on tap and I think it nails that
sound<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> first<00:01:17.280> thing<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
sound which to me the first thing I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
with a natural bit of compression and

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.320 
with a natural bit of compression and
that's<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.140> pedal<00:01:37.470> does<00:01:37.649> in<00:01:37.860> spades

that's what this pedal does in spades
you<00:01:39.330> know<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.720> smooths<00:01:40.110> almost<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.680> a

you know it's like smooths almost like a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.040 
you know it's like smooths almost like a
jazz<00:01:41.160> overdrive<00:01:41.910> because<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.240> handles<00:01:42.630> single

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
jazz overdrive because it handles single

jazz overdrive because it handles single
note<00:01:43.170> stuffs<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:44.100> beautifully<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
it that just no other amps really do

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.130 
it that just no other amps really do
when<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.149> overdrive<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.959> pedal

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
when they overdrive and it's a pedal

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.919 
when they overdrive and it's a pedal
captures<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.800> really<00:01:56.100> well<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.750> got<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
captures that really well you got a

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.240 
captures that really well you got a
little<00:01:58.319> switch<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.830> middle<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.039> goes

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
little switch in the middle that goes

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
little switch in the middle that goes
between<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> jazz<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.330> rock<00:02:00.539> setting

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
between the jazz and the rock setting

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.779 
between the jazz and the rock setting
the<00:02:01.350> Jazz<00:02:01.619> setting<00:02:02.009> would<00:02:02.100> obviously<00:02:02.459> be<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
the Jazz setting would obviously be the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.859 
the Jazz setting would obviously be the
smoother<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:04.259> little<00:02:04.950> bit<00:02:05.039> more<00:02:05.250> compressed

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
smoother a little bit more compressed

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
smoother a little bit more compressed
less<00:02:06.869> aggressive<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.190> two<00:02:08.340> settings<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
less aggressive of the two settings the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.880 
less aggressive of the two settings the
rock<00:02:09.149> setting<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.080> definitely<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> little<00:02:10.709> bit

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
rock setting is definitely a little bit

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.500 
rock setting is definitely a little bit
more<00:02:11.039> aggressive<00:02:11.490> there's<00:02:11.700> more<00:02:11.940> volume<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
more aggressive there's more volume and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.690 
more aggressive there's more volume and
output<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.020> tap<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.620> general<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.610> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
output on tap just in general and it's a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.550 
output on tap just in general and it's a
more<00:02:14.880> wide<00:02:15.150> open<00:02:15.180> sound<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.959> kind<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.349> you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
more wide open sound it kind of like you

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.320 
more wide open sound it kind of like you
know<00:02:16.890> takes<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.400> lid<00:02:17.580> off<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.970> lets<00:02:18.150> it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
know takes the lid off and lets it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.500 
know takes the lid off and lets it
really<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:19.709> fly

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
really really fly

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.699 
really really fly
definitely<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:21.660> appropriate<00:02:22.200> for<00:02:22.230> playing

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
definitely more appropriate for playing

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.780 
definitely more appropriate for playing
rock<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.000> rock<00:02:24.209> setting<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.200> to
