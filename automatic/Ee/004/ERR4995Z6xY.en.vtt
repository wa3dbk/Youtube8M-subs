playing<00:00:20.010> Minecraft<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:21.420> sheeters<00:00:21.930> I'm

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
playing Minecraft here with sheeters I'm

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
playing Minecraft here with sheeters I'm
only<00:00:22.650> playing<00:00:22.859> at<00:00:23.039> 8<00:00:23.220> chunks<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.730> have

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
only playing at 8 chunks but I have

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.250 
only playing at 8 chunks but I have
everything<00:00:24.119> else<00:00:24.330> at<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> highest<00:00:25.019> settings

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
everything else at the highest settings

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.640 
everything else at the highest settings
this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> Zeus<00:00:26.160> shooters<00:00:27.119> mod<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
this is the Zeus shooters mod with I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
this is the Zeus shooters mod with I
believe<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> normal<00:00:30.330> because

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
believe this is just the normal because

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.659 
believe this is just the normal because
anything<00:00:31.679> above<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.309> would<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.640> not

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
anything above this it would just not

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490 
anything above this it would just not
build<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.270> run<00:00:33.450> unless<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.050> playing<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> like

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
build a run unless I was playing it like

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.610 
build a run unless I was playing it like
two<00:00:34.680> chunks<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.969> besides<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.260> want<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
two chunks but besides that I want to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.400 
two chunks but besides that I want to
tell<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.860> guys<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.250> my<00:00:39.030> last<00:00:39.270> video<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.020> did

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
tell you guys that my last video I did

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.709 
tell you guys that my last video I did
with<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> benchmark<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> couldn't<00:00:41.520> get

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
with the benchmark I couldn't get

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
with the benchmark I couldn't get
shooters<00:00:42.719> drawn<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> stupidest

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
shooters drawn for one of the stupidest

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.200

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
reasons

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
reasons
ever<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.829> turned<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
ever it actually turned out that all I

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
ever it actually turned out that all I
had<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.180> open<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.629> file<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.500> Java

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
had to do was open the file in a Java

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
had to do was open the file in a Java
file<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:50.789> accidentally<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.570> opening

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
file and I was accidentally not opening

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
file and I was accidentally not opening
it<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.219> reality<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.789> extremely

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it there so in reality it was extremely

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
it there so in reality it was extremely
easy<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.840> fix<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.949> besides<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.610> gonna

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
although I must admit it definitely does

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.279 
although I must admit it definitely does
struggle<00:04:18.289> at<00:04:18.470> some<00:04:18.739> points<00:04:19.130> just<00:04:19.400> old<00:04:19.609> 30fps

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
struggle at some points just old 30fps

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.779
