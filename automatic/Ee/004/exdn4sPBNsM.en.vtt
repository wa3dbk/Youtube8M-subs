so today I'm going to show you how to
plant<00:00:08.510> a<00:00:08.570> tree<00:00:08.809> the<00:00:09.469> first<00:00:09.680> thing<00:00:09.980> you<00:00:10.190> do<00:00:10.309> is

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
plant a tree the first thing you do is

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.510 
plant a tree the first thing you do is
just<00:00:10.820> move<00:00:11.000> to<00:00:11.210> where<00:00:11.330> you<00:00:11.420> need<00:00:11.600> to<00:00:12.369> you<00:00:13.369> want

just move to where you need to you want
to<00:00:13.639> plant<00:00:13.850> it<00:00:13.940> and<00:00:14.230> just<00:00:15.230> put<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.529> bucket

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
to plant it and just put the bucket

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.040 
to plant it and just put the bucket
g-guys<00:00:16.309> where<00:00:16.610> you<00:00:16.699> want<00:00:16.880> it<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.150> you<00:00:17.840> want<00:00:17.990> to

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
g-guys where you want it and you want to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.220 
g-guys where you want it and you want to
start<00:00:18.260> about<00:00:18.529> a<00:00:18.560> foot<00:00:18.770> away<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:19.820> just<00:00:20.359> develop

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
start about a foot away and just develop

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.669 
start about a foot away and just develop
a<00:00:22.240> line<00:00:23.240> around<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:24.880> you<00:00:25.880> put<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.210> tree<00:00:26.449> in

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
a line around it you put the tree in

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.409 
a line around it you put the tree in
it's<00:00:27.679> got<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.829> little<00:00:28.009> bit<00:00:28.220> of<00:00:28.310> room<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:29.240> you

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
it's got a little bit of room and you

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:40.040 
it's got a little bit of room and you
can<00:00:29.599> pack<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.019> in<00:00:30.140> around<00:00:30.380> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.990 

so<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.109> got<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.379> outline<00:00:41.649> now<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.190> basically<00:00:42.519> I

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
so I got the outline now and basically I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.180 
so I got the outline now and basically I
just<00:00:43.510> wanted<00:00:43.899> to<00:00:44.050> get<00:00:44.230> as<00:00:44.469> deep<00:00:44.530> as<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.039> root

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
just wanted to get as deep as the root

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.569 
just wanted to get as deep as the root
ball

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
ball

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.970 
ball
so<00:00:45.910> as<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.120> can<00:00:46.239> do<00:00:46.390> too<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.659> just<00:00:47.530> instead<00:00:47.920> of

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
so as you can do too is just instead of

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.920 
so as you can do too is just instead of
putting<00:00:48.159> the<00:00:48.280> tree<00:00:48.489> in<00:00:48.550> there<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:49.780> you're

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
putting the tree in there when you're

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.779 
putting the tree in there when you're
digging<00:00:50.109> it<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.769> just<00:00:51.070> take<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.370> bucket<00:00:51.519> off

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
digging it is just take the bucket off

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.939 
digging it is just take the bucket off
of<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.030> tree<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.899> see<00:00:53.170> how<00:00:53.229> you<00:00:53.289> guys<00:00:53.559> we<00:00:53.800> got

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
of the tree and see how you guys we got

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.910 
of the tree and see how you guys we got
the<00:00:54.129> hole<00:00:54.309> dug<00:00:55.030> right<00:00:55.269> now<00:00:55.479> and<00:00:55.930> do<00:00:56.710> don't<00:00:56.860> let

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
the hole dug right now and do don't let

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.069 
the hole dug right now and do don't let
C<00:00:57.129> be<00:00:57.159> big<00:00:57.670> enough<00:00:57.789> so<00:00:58.059> we<00:00:58.299> want<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:58.750> do<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:58.899> take

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
C be big enough so we want to do is take

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.930 
C be big enough so we want to do is take
the<00:00:59.170> tree<00:00:59.379> out<00:00:59.409> of<00:00:59.530> bucket<00:00:59.979> and<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.909> bucket

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
the tree out of bucket and the bucket

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:14.510 
the tree out of bucket and the bucket
and<00:01:01.449> hole<00:01:01.659> see<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.810> she's<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.049> little<00:01:11.259> bit<00:01:11.409> low

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.859 

looks<00:01:15.520> like<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:17.200> more<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:19.600> about

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
looks like there is more is down about

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.719 
looks like there is more is down about
here<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:22.030> an<00:01:22.240> inch<00:01:22.539> or<00:01:22.780> two<00:01:23.020> more<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.520> one

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
here not an inch or two more and one

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.700 
here not an inch or two more and one
thing<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:25.030> want<00:01:25.179> to<00:01:25.270> make<00:01:25.390> sure<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.750> have<00:01:25.810> in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
thing you want to make sure to have in

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.990 
thing you want to make sure to have in
the<00:01:26.799> hole<00:01:26.979> for<00:01:27.190> three<00:01:27.539> say<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:28.780> very<00:01:29.880> hard<00:01:30.880> to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
the hole for three say that very hard to

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.880 
the hole for three say that very hard to
dig<00:01:31.179> holes<00:01:31.360> especially<00:01:31.810> if<00:01:32.289> there's<00:01:32.590> play

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
dig holes especially if there's play

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:53.040 
dig holes especially if there's play
that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.560 

the<00:01:54.050> trees<00:01:54.320> really<00:01:54.620> grown<00:01:54.980> in<00:01:58.060> their<00:01:59.060> circling

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
the trees really grown in their circling

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.980 
the trees really grown in their circling
route<00:02:01.810> Hindus<00:02:02.810> go<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.470> four<00:02:04.310> sides<00:02:04.550> and<00:02:04.990> just

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
route Hindus go on four sides and just

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.790 
route Hindus go on four sides and just
cut<00:02:06.230> down<00:02:06.550> two<00:02:07.550> inches<00:02:07.760> if<00:02:08.750> stopped<00:02:09.170> every

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
cut down two inches if stopped every

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.170 
cut down two inches if stopped every
single<00:02:10.190> branch<00:02:10.460> outwards

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
single branch outwards

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.170 
single branch outwards
instead<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.020> going<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.860> towards<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.280> tree<00:02:13.610> for

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
instead of going in towards the tree for

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:40.449 
instead of going in towards the tree for
your<00:02:14.300> circling<00:02:37.330> tree<00:02:38.330> over<00:02:38.570> there<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:40.160> roll

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
your circling tree over there and roll

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.000 
your circling tree over there and roll
it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
it

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.340 
it
that's<00:02:43.010> way<00:02:43.310> good<00:02:43.840> get<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> tree<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.230> there

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
that's way good get the tree in there

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.660 
that's way good get the tree in there
you<00:02:45.500> want<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.680> make<00:02:45.800> sure<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.100> about<00:02:46.250> level

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
you want to make sure it's about level

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.660 
you want to make sure it's about level
with<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.480> ground<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:48.130> love<00:02:49.130> looking<00:02:49.489> for

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
with the ground I love looking for

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.009 
with the ground I love looking for
anything<00:02:49.970> else<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:52.720> worry<00:02:53.720> about<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
anything else and you worry about the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.530 
anything else and you worry about the
straightness<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> little<00:02:55.010> bit<00:02:55.130> later<00:02:55.540> it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
straightness a little bit later it's

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:07.690 
straightness a little bit later it's
really<00:02:56.810> hard<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.580> say<00:02:58.580> if<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.060> Christmas

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.369 

so<00:03:08.700> once<00:03:08.879> you<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.120> about<00:03:09.390> half<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.170> dirt

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
so once you get about half of the dirt

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.690 
so once you get about half of the dirt
in<00:03:10.620> here<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.269> packed<00:03:12.569> around<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.019> tree<00:03:13.700> it's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
in here so I packed around the tree it's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.179 
in here so I packed around the tree it's
nice<00:03:14.939> and<00:03:15.209> tight<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.420> there<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:16.799> don't<00:03:16.890> want<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
nice and tight in there you don't want a

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:22.839 
nice and tight in there you don't want a
bunch<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.489> air<00:03:17.610> pockets<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:19.170> then<00:03:19.590> bottom<00:03:19.980> lip

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.520 

you<00:03:23.849> can<00:03:23.939> just<00:03:24.120> fill<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.510> rest<00:03:24.659> up<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.079> dirt

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530

in<00:03:29.010> which<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.400> got<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.820> tree<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.210> there<00:03:30.390> good

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
in which you got the tree in there good

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.610 
in which you got the tree in there good
and<00:03:31.800> snug<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.160> got<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.970> dirt<00:03:33.780> level<00:03:34.500> you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
and snug and got the dirt level you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.400 
and snug and got the dirt level you
don't<00:03:34.770> want<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.090> above<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.330> either<00:03:36.930> level<00:03:37.170> or

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
don't want it above it either level or

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.240 
don't want it above it either level or
slightly<00:03:37.590> below<00:03:38.600> make<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.630> little<00:03:39.870> path<00:03:40.620> left<00:03:40.980> a

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
slightly below make a little path left a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.430 
slightly below make a little path left a
little<00:03:41.940> dam<00:03:42.240> on<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.660> side<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.110> keep<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
little dam on this side and keep the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.020 
little dam on this side and keep the
water<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.770> great

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
water in great

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.870 
water in great
you<00:03:46.390> basically<00:03:46.660> want<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.140> make<00:03:47.319> this<00:03:47.470> dam

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
you basically want to make this dam

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.540 
you basically want to make this dam
because<00:03:49.260> it's<00:03:50.260> downhill<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.069> way<00:03:51.280> if<00:03:51.400> you

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
because it's downhill this way if you

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.180 
because it's downhill this way if you
get<00:03:51.730> down<00:03:51.970> see<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.470> downhill<00:03:53.800> this

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
get down see that it is downhill this

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.970 
get down see that it is downhill this
way<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:56.110> don't<00:03:56.350> need<00:03:56.500> all<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.890> way

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
way and you don't need all the way

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.360 
way and you don't need all the way
around<00:03:57.400> tree<00:03:57.790> whose<00:03:58.480> level<00:03:58.959> ground

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
around tree whose level ground

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.500 
around tree whose level ground
you<00:04:00.370> probably<00:04:00.670> want<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.000> all<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.270> way<00:04:01.360> around

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
you probably want it all the way around

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:10.350 
you probably want it all the way around
the<00:04:01.750> tree<00:04:01.959> and<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:07.390> want<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.810> little<00:04:08.110> bit<00:04:09.360> past

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
the tree and you want a little bit past

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.880 
the tree and you want a little bit past
the<00:04:10.569> root<00:04:10.810> ball<00:04:10.959> because<00:04:11.350> that's<00:04:11.560> where<00:04:11.800> the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
the root ball because that's where the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.520 
the root ball because that's where the
roots<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.220> good<00:04:12.400> needs<00:04:12.580> always<00:04:12.900> do<00:04:13.900> that<00:04:14.140> pack

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
roots a good needs always do that pack

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.630 
roots a good needs always do that pack
it<00:04:14.650> all<00:04:14.739> down<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.919> over<00:04:17.919> here<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.250> can<00:04:18.280> level

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
it all down and over here you can level

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.009 
it all down and over here you can level
it<00:04:18.820> out<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.030> little<00:04:19.120> bit<00:04:19.329> if<00:04:19.450> it's<00:04:19.600> true<00:04:19.780> high

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it out a little bit if it's true high

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.440 
it out a little bit if it's true high
love<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.190> sitting<00:04:21.700> gets<00:04:21.850> more<00:04:22.120> even

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
love of that sitting gets more even

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.020 
love of that sitting gets more even
water<00:04:22.960> on<00:04:23.169> both<00:04:23.350> sides<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.640> really<00:04:24.820> makes

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
water on both sides and it really makes

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.790 
water on both sides and it really makes
the<00:04:25.360> dam<00:04:25.570> really<00:04:25.840> makes<00:04:26.050> it<00:04:26.140> easier<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.500> water

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
the dam really makes it easier to water

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.650 
the dam really makes it easier to water
it<00:04:28.050> when<00:04:29.050> it's<00:04:29.410> dry<00:04:29.650> or<00:04:29.770> whatever<00:04:30.220> in<00:04:32.490> basics

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
it when it's dry or whatever in basics

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.950 
it when it's dry or whatever in basics
then<00:04:34.660> just<00:04:34.870> water<00:04:35.080> your<00:04:35.260> tree<00:04:35.470> after<00:04:35.770> that
