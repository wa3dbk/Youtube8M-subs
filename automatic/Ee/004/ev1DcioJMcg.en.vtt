00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
know that the thing is part is how to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000 
know that the thing is part is how to
drive<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.260> actually<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.829> no<00:00:40.980> idea

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.700 
drive I actually know I have no idea
what<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> heck<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.270> when<00:00:43.050> flying

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
what what the heck that was when flying

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250 
what what the heck that was when flying
like<00:00:43.980> rocket<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.820> anyways<00:00:45.270> um<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.989> pretty

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
like rocket but anyways um it's pretty

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
like rocket but anyways um it's pretty
much<00:00:46.379> impossible<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> killed<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
much impossible to get it killed you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.400 
much impossible to get it killed you
just<00:00:48.390> run<00:00:48.510> around<00:00:48.629> trying<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> kill<00:00:49.379> people

is a prior requirement and if you don't
do<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:40.650> you'll<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.479> all

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
do that then you'll have to do this all

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.460 
do that then you'll have to do this all

over again

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.580 
over again
which<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.759> suck<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.840> yeah<00:01:46.439> after

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
