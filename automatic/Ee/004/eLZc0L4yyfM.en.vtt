 who's going to be the team captain what 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.850
 function has a captain actually 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.510

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.840
 participants are going 0 11 competing and 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.270
 I'm putting together the strategy of using expensive 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.510
 let's go in the coach's base 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.010
 but day by day we go on base what 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.210
 We have trained, there will be different 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.130
 strength intelligence competitions 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.530
 then the obligation will be on me 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.490
 is to see that the boys which of the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.500
 guys for sure to see which of the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.700
 better guys for that competition not 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.820
 he has confirmed 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.430
 to watch five games per day and go to 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.070
 participate almost every day a game 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.380
 let's make an idea they are all export 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.450
 so 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.880
 it's a mystery we leave a mystery 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.759
 as we are focusing on Monday this 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.409
 that comes we started to train but 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.909
 good me with me do boxing say 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.179
 that I'm going to implement a little the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.179
 boxing training because we forgive 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.039
 of the formats of this same problem 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.130
 that is all the rage in the world 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.819
 they say they change the physique if the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.610
 participants stress awareness 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.049
 power speed another day when 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.840
 we have the meeting with frame sleep 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.299
 is explaining well the format all we 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.569
 he said clearly and showed us that 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.870
 the first of the participants was a 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.340
 thing and when they left many won 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.660
 different countries were another physicist another 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.660
 kind of people 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.590
 5 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.550
 for example we have the best green color 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.550
 the green that is advanced 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.700
 with rivals 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.510
 because they told me that you and the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.510
 we read half 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.440
 when we see that we have to start giving 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.440
 messages of encouragement 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.840
 good 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:33.140
 it's a hope I hope I can have the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.140
 Hope to win only 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.319
 come to know the guys that meet 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.510
 Monday and there it is good can be to 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:49.250
 work and based on that we're going to 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:52.700
 compete and they also do the games 6 and 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.680
 6 to see game that out there suits me 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.680
 just me or someone else then 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.220
 I make you enjoy 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.660
 they explained that there could be a kind of 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.190
 rise within your own team 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.670
 changing the captain as saying what 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.670
 that you 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.799
 and the turkish is a serious champion 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.360
 exists that is now very fashionable and 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.759
 Group work motivation tenÃ©s 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.129
 a speech to start with the group 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.860
 like to pay for chiclero good that 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.210
 I was telling you or the color is the one that 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.479
 allows to advance and red is the one that 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.409
 slow down with that we start forwards 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.409
 then yes 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.100
 dangerous 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.720
 Of course you have to be careful 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.340
 that is responsible in between torment 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.390
 there are two hours of physical preparation 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.830
 after two hours the boys have 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.130
 to practice the tests that are going to 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.200
 do that day but they are tests that I say 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.960
 that what I saw in some parts 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.140
 I appreciated not having to participate and what 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.140
 we go 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:17.220
 for the listeners 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.220
 and it can be worse than what you have now 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:30.919
 schedules May 5 5 2 in the afternoon until 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:35.249
 7 in the beginning and nothing we start 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:38.779
 next Monday we start 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:41.339
 stop thinking about what team we 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.759
 we left for today the program does not 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.759
 divide 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:52.069
 we have to talk to him 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.860
 Boys
