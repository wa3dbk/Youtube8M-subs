what I mean by that is you know all the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.150 
what I mean by that is you know all the
glass<00:00:14.219> cutter<00:00:14.670> does<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.800> score<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> glass

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
glass cutter does is score the glass

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000 
glass cutter does is score the glass
that<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.150> say<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.810> provides<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
that is to say it kind of provides a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.390 
that is to say it kind of provides a
very<00:00:20.220> very<00:00:21.060> shallow<00:00:21.420> crack<00:00:22.050> along<00:00:22.949> which<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
very very shallow crack along which the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.970 
very very shallow crack along which the
glass<00:00:23.640> will<00:00:24.090> break<00:00:24.300> when<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> break<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.529> but

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
glass will break when you break it but

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
glass will break when you break it but
it<00:00:26.099> doesn't<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:27.000> cut<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> glass<00:00:27.630> apart

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
it doesn't you know cut the glass apart

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.450 
it doesn't you know cut the glass apart

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the way a razor blade does or something

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
the way a razor blade does or something
it<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.609> kind<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> scores<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> glass<00:00:30.900> with<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
it just kind of scores the glass with a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.889 
it just kind of scores the glass with a
thin<00:00:31.590> crack<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> break

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
thin crack and then you have to break

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.240 
thin crack and then you have to break
that<00:00:33.960> glass<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> controlled<00:00:35.160> manner

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that glass in a controlled manner

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.190 
that glass in a controlled manner
there's<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.059> few<00:00:36.270> ways<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.110> do

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
there's a few ways to do it you can do

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.540 
there's a few ways to do it you can do
it<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.530> hands<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
it with your hands you can do it on the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.799 
it with your hands you can do it on the
table<00:00:38.760> we'll<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.239> through<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> those

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
table we'll go through some of those

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
table we'll go through some of those
methods<00:00:40.100> one<00:00:41.100> way<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.000> pliers

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
methods one way to do it is with pliers

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.139 
methods one way to do it is with pliers
now<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> sets<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.430> pliers<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.969> get

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
now so one of the sets of pliers you get

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.360 
now so one of the sets of pliers you get
should<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> set<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> breaking<00:00:47.070> glass

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
should be a set of breaking glass

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
should be a set of breaking glass
breaking<00:00:47.489> pliers<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> stained

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
breaking pliers and if you go to stained

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.560 
breaking pliers and if you go to stained
glass<00:00:50.340> supply<00:00:50.370> store<00:00:51.059> you'll<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.360> able<00:00:51.420> to

little bit of kind of protection from

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
little bit of kind of protection from
digging<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.150> glass<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.750> maybe

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
digging into that glass or maybe

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
digging into that glass or maybe
cracking<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.920> glass<00:01:26.159> even<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
cracking that glass even more so you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.880 
cracking that glass even more so you
don't<00:01:27.540> need<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.049> those<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.619> sort<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
don't need to have those that sort of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
don't need to have those that sort of
rubber<00:01:29.100> housing<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> tips<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
rubber housing on the tips but I like it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.719 
rubber housing on the tips but I like it

with<00:01:46.829> glass<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.310> different<00:01:47.610> thickness<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
with glass of different thickness you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
with glass of different thickness you
just<00:01:48.390> sort<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.290> put<00:01:49.530> your<00:01:49.619> glass<00:01:49.829> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
just sort of you know put your glass in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.800 
just sort of you know put your glass in
there<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:50.939> turn<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.390> until<00:01:51.689> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there and then turn this until it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
there and then turn this until it
tightens<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.280> no<00:01:53.520> matter<00:01:53.670> how<00:01:53.850> much

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
tightens up and so no matter how much

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.670 
tightens up and so no matter how much
you<00:01:54.180> squeeze<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> be

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you squeeze you're not going to be

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.080 
you squeeze you're not going to be
putting<00:01:55.920> any<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.189> pressure<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> glass

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
putting any more pressure on the glass

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
putting any more pressure on the glass
but<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.290> imagine<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> glass

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
but you can imagine if I have the glass

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.450 
but you can imagine if I have the glass
scored<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.280> like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
scored and you know I have it in like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 
scored and you know I have it in like
this<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.060> don't<00:02:03.420> need<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> pressure<00:02:04.380> all

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this I don't need a lot of pressure all

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
this I don't need a lot of pressure all
I<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:04.979> need<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.759> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.060> bend

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I really need to do is just kind of bend

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.839 
I really need to do is just kind of bend
down<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.890> there's<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.129> nice<00:02:08.280> score<00:02:08.610> line

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
down and if there's a nice score line

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.040 
down and if there's a nice score line
there<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> glass<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.569> break<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> we're

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
there that glass will break and we're

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.390 
there that glass will break and we're
gonna<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.319> through<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.560> technique<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.190> don't

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
gonna go through that technique so don't

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
gonna go through that technique so don't
worry<00:02:11.489> about<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:12.030> yet

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
worry about it just yet

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.740

the next clip I'm going to talk about
the<00:02:17.250> other<00:02:17.340> pliers<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:17.939> are<00:02:18.090> used<00:02:18.239> for
