00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 So everyone lost to a new tutorial 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.029
 and today there is something small again 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.189
 Funny playful is namely one 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.410
 relatively good trap for players 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.239
 you could see 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 Here nothing is operated not 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.600
 switch to running over no tripwire 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 high or similar over it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.679
 but where and when even position at the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.960
 login to dismantle 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.190
 just down without me really 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.749
 Something makes city ​​run easy 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 and it goes in 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.140
 when I'm gone, it goes back to and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 there is nothing you can do well and also 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.609
 fall in again without that really 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.789
 to see something dispensable is like the whole 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:03.239
 Building is relatively small but right 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.100
 clever and I show that now I have 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 all then prepared next to my 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.120
 that sauce story is eight blocks 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.680
 For the reason it is so broad 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.050
 the minimum of what you can do for it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.370
 needs to portray the whole thing in the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.930
 middle of the fall tunnel is just two 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.860
 blocks wide because it is easiest 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.820
 that the circuit for him 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.369
 the player can hide 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.170
 falls off and I would say 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.600
 make it easy to get caught and that at the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.009
 side of the pit need first 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.899
 Business naturally in the ground 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 Here are the lava 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.159
 group of the middle and in a blog 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.030
 distance from it so come back now 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.409
 It's his turn and then both sides again 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 It could also take longer than here 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.189
 can still make 5 6 7 8 9 10 each 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.890
 after how long the whole thing wanted to have 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.329
 of course logical but I think so 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.270
 actually enough for the relationship then 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.289
 we get blocks in front of each because it 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.969
 in the blocks pressed forward 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.009
 be and blocks behind it 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.289
 take the the blocks where we have a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.969
 track over it so that the slopes 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.310
 also all are cultivated in the case 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.350
 redstone and that's why 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 the same again trained so narrow 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 connected so the current is there 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.630
 Press everyone know should be clear 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 otherwise , first comes a little 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.810
 wall because of course, the player should 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.990
 lie to see what is behind it 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.550
 and we'll do that for the first time, I think 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.230
 the centerpiece of the entire plant 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.940
 contest times out on it for it 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.379
 the small command blog need that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.680
 Now imagine it is nice 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.879
 small command we 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.510
 Just test before the next one 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.569
 player in a radius of summer six 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.250
 blocks and whenever this one 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.510
 player more practical if tested 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.799
 it was a positive result 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.969
 then enter this command block 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.099
 signal from the ritz and corporate the 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.109
 put it on the chamber and then said 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.569
 command blogger here is a power 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.359
 what good the whole of course must be less 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.879
 clock be built because of this command 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.980
 blogs to every second 23 times test so 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.299
 and test it as often as possible 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.590
 the whole story too fast 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.319
 reacts as possible so brings nothing 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.549
 if you go with me a minute later 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.620
 It is tested that we already have 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.900
 go away the same way and that's why 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.329
 we'll be quick and need it 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.980
 we also a petty place and that 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.889
 best i think i say is one 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.079
 small stool klopp because blogs of 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.819
 repeater processor wlan repeater 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.139
 go in again redstone this circle 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.150
 running all the time to grind 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.219
 sometimes they like to stand and 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.319
 why do it like we need a 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.269
 hopper whose another hopper 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.190
 The other leads back in 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.329
 that hawker back that is one 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.489
 officer is bitten for the 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.260
 whole bouncing bouncing bonbon 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.419
 this ping pong moderately back and forth 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.900
 and every time the item in the one 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.489
 Stool is the hobby that's in it 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.549
 that means we could completely here too 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.709
 pull out a signal and therefore have 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.019
 we have a relatively fast clock for 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.959
 I'll tell you what timing is needed for the timing 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.189
 is one fast enough and yes me 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.870
 do not look close enough 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.310
 jumps you forward the signal to when I 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.799
 Of course I am far away 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.150
 By the way, that's what command jsoc looks like 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.979
 Go back when I'm six 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.189
 blocks in radius am because of it 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:06.680
 logically a pure circle and such 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.569
 then exactly just have to connect 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.009
 and then it would be even that 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.989
 entire story has been something 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:15.049
 pretty simple but clever 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.829
 really cool thing normal case 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:21.709
 so every order succinctly 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.449
 dranhängen because the signal is here 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.830
 through the computer, I believe only one 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.590
 block further I do not know who directed 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.789
 the skat which mau from a sometimes 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.779
 try a bit live I know exactly 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.779
 how she did it 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.449
 since the signal only seems that one 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.840
 Rescue would build repeaters on it 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.540
 make almost sure it is in there 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.220
 that means in normal condition when I am 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.690
 I'm not near the blocks 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.030
 pushed outward that gets through the 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.650
 guaranteed torch and if I then 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.060
 the proximity comes the signal beginning 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.310
 goes outside business retreats 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.570
 just a relatively simple agreement on the concept 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.190
 i can fill in as the troops 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.410
 is so very important to you 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.240
 here a hole or other and here 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.570
 then the same accordingly over there 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.520
 signal same story but there 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.310
 torch on it name the signal respectively 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.550
 always interrupted when I'm too close 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.750
 and hope that control group 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.790
 Concept already explained 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.930
 that has been the circuit that 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.139
 wrestling is easy to he what 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.130
 I build blocks around it 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.740
 should not see that we are in front 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:29.360
 Slopes are not too good 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:34.030
 and hope that then practically the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.030
 wall and the wall does not say a word 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.910
 son about british artist the floor 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.849
 can make me there one more time 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.780
 and as soon as someone crumbles 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.380
 or similar measure of it is approaching 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.419
 falls down more 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.610
 you can of course the resin 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.050
 enlarge depending on how you want 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.820
 I think I mentioned at the beginning 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.080
 I think that's enough of the size 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.370
 yes you might be a nice one 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.200
 small circuit which also fast too 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.760
 I hope it was reasonably build 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.889
 Interesting is not to be found 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.940
 with it and then we see each other in one 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.450
 next time again 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.450
 and bye
