00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.720

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.990
 about 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.310
 such with 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.849
 others are not just a designer 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.099
 ordinary people on our site you can 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.650
 you can see a few visible 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.320
 plots we are visiting patients 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.539
 Tatyana Kalashnikova and but that sap here 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.590
 see how many beautiful decorative here 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.110
 of plants 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.910
 but in general in this garden everything is there and 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.129
 currant grapes here there on that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.489
 growing in advance and there good grapes gave 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.199
 see here we have the month of August only 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.110
 begins and such big big 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.780
 brands and the most important thing in the greenhouse here 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.690
 wonderful large salad tomatoes 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 let's go and see how it all 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:11.490
 grown perennial denikin 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.260
 see how framed here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.320
 greenhouse approach to this about some here 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.920
 there are flowers all around and very fragrant 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.590
 flowers 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 it is still the same pleases greenhouse, too, should 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.920
 be nice blow guys 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.159
 such huge tomatoes gallente station 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.250
 grow this salad varieties yes speak 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.270
 Yes, I grow salads and grows methods 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.160
 I really like your method 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.960
 the only thing I disagree with is that 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.369
 he has a very large number 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.550
 Mineral give I not a supporter 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.400
 fertilizer fertilizing in 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.440
 mostly slurry carries with it 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.229
 very few look at what is schA 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.119
 I rock you I always went want more 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.090
 to feed 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.280
 feed itself assazh we grow there and 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.580
 greens section ladies fruit 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.230
 yes if overfeeding the door is not 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.180
 they felt sorry for them 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.640
 Now I want to say that there is no longer 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.090
 the first harvest was harvested to the lowest 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.380
 The first fruits have long been torn off and I 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.540
 our listeners 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.600
 and I want to remind our site than 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.410
 The mitlider method is a principle 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.989
 narrow ridges i.e. the bed should be 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.750
 more than 50 50 centimeters and aisle 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.239
 wider than the beds or at least though 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.549
 would be equal in width with us all the time 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.540
 saves here between these passages 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.390
 beds 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.549
 and what comes out of it the plants themselves 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.160
 shadow yourself here imagine if 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.810
 here look narrower passages here these 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.900
 tall plants they would be themselves 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.720
 shaded and light for plants 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.440
 it is the same energy source as 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.560
 water as a fertilizer so the method 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.510
 the mitlider is that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.480
 the plant gets a lot of light a lot 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.380
 energy precisely from the sun's rays 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:20.170
 such large indoor and ripening over 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:24.250
 here also look at us very 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.299
 very wet weather stands here 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.060
 sufficiently resistant plants no such 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.520
 blackened leaves like many gardens 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.440
 I saw others so that 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.230
 antena grow not only wonderful 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.870
 flowers here take a look here through the guys 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.210
 what a review of us from the wonderful opens 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.660
 and here in these gardens on 6 acres 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.740
 everything is possible for 5 even wives corrects us 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.440
 hostess 5 like this all fit together 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.650
 his nayder they planted after 17 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.350
 half centimeters one by one 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.500
 rotating them in one row at 12 in one trunk 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.550
 up to one barrel and everything pays off 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.370
 all justify myself there is but 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.590
 salad tomatoes because they do not happen on 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.500
 bushes too much because all 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.620
 they still have decent weight 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.040
 I monitor myself they are also salad we 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.940
 they are just not very big but of course 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.210
 here is more tasty i am here i am essentially 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.180
 business ladder lied to me not the cathedral here 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.960
 I can't see that there were flower stalks here 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.560
 there were tomatoes so look at 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.640
 still here i plant Libya and for my 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.030
 girlfriends grow flowers bouquets flowers this 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.030
 not much earlier than in the ground 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.630
 the height of the flowers is a huge size of each 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:00.350
 flower too big they do not stain 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.030
 the flower they are not pouring water case 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.150
 almost never water 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.800
 that is, the flower itself is very cleaned dry 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:12.380
 beautiful petals are very clean and injected 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.660
 there are many where I stand 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.270
 such a density but nonetheless 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.660
 large 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.990
 flower spike large high here I am again 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.480
 I want to emphasize that Galen Constantine 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.240
 on the mitlider method here again 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.160
 look what narrow pretty 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:37.900
 beds and large gaps 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:40.090
 method 5 meter 5 yes here barrels stand 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.270
 for water for fertilizer 10 not 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.880
 a practical garden is being set up like this 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.630
 and at the same time amazingly beautiful and 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.630
 practical
