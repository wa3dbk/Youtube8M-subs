machine gun but we're going to be using

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.429 
machine gun but we're going to be using
multiple<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.240> them<00:00:21.480> which<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> look

to use arrows to make it go offer
whatever<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> want<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> call<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.900> first<00:00:30.900> up

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
whatever you want to call it so first up

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.569 
whatever you want to call it so first up
let's<00:00:31.170> put<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.579> dispensers<00:00:32.989> on<00:00:33.989> them<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:36.440> yep

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
let's put the dispensers on them up yep

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.959 
let's put the dispensers on them up yep
we'll<00:00:38.579> make<00:00:38.760> two<00:00:39.149> layers<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:41.879> should<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.239> fine

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
we'll make two layers to should be fine

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.650 
we'll make two layers to should be fine
put<00:00:44.969> some<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:47.090> it's<00:00:48.090> actually<00:00:48.480> pretty

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
easy lay out once you get used to it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.850 
easy lay out once you get used to it
okay<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> put<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.079> second

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
okay now we're going to put the second

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
okay now we're going to put the second
layer<00:00:53.160> sink<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.059> repeaters<00:00:54.510> behind<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
layer sink and put repeaters behind it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
layer sink and put repeaters behind it
like<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.820> we're<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.149> do

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

like right there what we're going to do
is<00:00:57.420> bring<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> repeaters<00:00:58.289> behind<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> every

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
is bring the repeaters behind you every

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.560 
is bring the repeaters behind you every
single<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> them<00:01:02.180> don't<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> set

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
single one of them don't want to set

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
single one of them don't want to set
that<00:01:03.809> okay<00:01:04.799> now<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> we've<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.460> repeater

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that okay now that we've got repeater

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.929 
that okay now that we've got repeater
set<00:01:06.119> behind<00:01:06.270> nervous<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:08.760> should

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
set behind nervous in the one we should

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.399 
set behind nervous in the one we should
probably<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:10.369> for<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> second<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:11.970> right<00:01:12.180> yeah

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
probably a for a second there right yeah

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
probably a for a second there right yeah
yeah<00:01:13.850> now<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.659> we

yeah now what we're going to do is we
were<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> line<00:01:16.439> every<00:01:16.950> single<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
were going to line every single one of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.220 
were going to line every single one of
these<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.820> redstone

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.410 

okay<00:01:25.230> so<00:01:28.430> now<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.610> we're<00:01:29.760> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.120> is

okay so now what we're going to do is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.440 
okay so now what we're going to do is
make<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.940> mechanism<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.150> make<00:01:33.330> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
make the mechanism that will make it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.510 
make the mechanism that will make it
shoot<00:01:33.690> fully<00:01:34.230> automatic<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.040> customize

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
shoot fully automatic you can customize

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.300 
shoot fully automatic you can customize
how<00:01:35.730> fast<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.510> go<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.130> will

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
how fast you want it to go but I will

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.780 
how fast you want it to go but I will
show<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.030> more<00:01:39.210> advanced<00:01:39.450> tutorial

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
show that in a more advanced tutorial

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.360 
show that in a more advanced tutorial
this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.360> basic<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:43.040> okay<00:01:44.040> now<00:01:44.250> what

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
this is just a basic one okay now what

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.530 
this is just a basic one okay now what
we're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.730> do<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.090> you're<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
we're going to do is you're going to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.000 
we're going to do is you're going to
place<00:01:45.750> them<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.260> a<00:01:46.740> square<00:01:47.340> shape<00:01:48.590> on<00:01:50.060> two

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
place them in a square shape on two

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.320 
place them in a square shape on two
three<00:01:53.180> four<00:01:54.180> five<00:01:54.830> six<00:01:56.600> seven<00:01:57.800> eight<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:59.580> think

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
three four five six seven eight I think

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.060 
three four five six seven eight I think
that<00:02:00.390> might<00:02:00.690> be<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.900> little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.320> too<00:02:01.500> many<00:02:01.710> but

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that might be a little bit too many but

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.760 
that might be a little bit too many but
we're<00:02:02.760> just<00:02:02.940> going<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.290> see<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.440> one<00:02:04.590> works

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
we're just going to see which one works

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.640 
we're just going to see which one works
the<00:02:04.950> best<00:02:05.720> okay<00:02:06.720> now<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.080> we're<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.530> do

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
the best okay now what we're going to do

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.510 
the best okay now what we're going to do
is<00:02:07.950> we're<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.460> connect<00:02:09.000> all<00:02:09.240> these<00:02:09.570> up

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
is we're going to connect all these up

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.480 
is we're going to connect all these up
we're<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.790> load<00:02:11.910> some<00:02:12.210> arrows<00:02:13.490> where

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
we're going to load some arrows where

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.130 
we're going to load some arrows where
are<00:02:14.670> those<00:02:14.790> arrows<00:02:15.800> found<00:02:16.800> them<00:02:17.840> yup<00:02:18.840> they're

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
are those arrows found them yup they're

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.880 
are those arrows found them yup they're
there<00:02:19.410> oh<00:02:20.390> wow<00:02:21.390> well<00:02:22.140> apparently<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.560> had<00:02:22.710> air

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
there oh wow well apparently I had air

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.470 
there oh wow well apparently I had air
was<00:02:23.010> my<00:02:23.190> image<00:02:23.370> we're<00:02:23.490> already<00:02:23.730> that

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
was my image we're already that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.400 
was my image we're already that
definitely<00:02:24.810> helps<00:02:27.200> loading<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.290> these<00:02:28.470> up

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
definitely helps loading all these up

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.130 
definitely helps loading all these up
we've<00:02:31.410> got<00:02:31.440> every<00:02:31.770> single<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.720> now<00:02:33.720> into<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
we've got every single one now into the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.820 
we've got every single one now into the
top<00:02:34.350> row

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
not that I'll need one more got that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.910 
not that I'll need one more got that
okay<00:02:44.870> now<00:02:45.050> we're<00:02:45.230> going<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.770> we're

actually going to make it shoot what
we're<00:02:48.530> gonna<00:02:48.620> do<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.100> we're<00:02:49.280> going<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.490> place<00:02:49.670> a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
we're gonna do is we're going to place a

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.180 
we're gonna do is we're going to place a
redstone<00:02:49.910> torch<00:02:50.300> down<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.110> remove<00:02:51.740> it<00:02:51.830> really

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
redstone torch down and remove it really

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.420 
redstone torch down and remove it really
fast<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.720> get<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.960> timing<00:02:54.200> right<00:02:54.430> or

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
fast you have to get the timing right or

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.980 
fast you have to get the timing right or
else<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.850> won't<00:02:55.970> work<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.420> really<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:56.930> that

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
else it won't work it's really not that

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.480 
else it won't work it's really not that
hard<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.500> do<00:02:57.620> but<00:02:58.100> let's<00:02:58.580> start<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.240> off<00:03:01.750> well<00:03:02.750> I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
hard to do but let's start it off well I

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.640 
hard to do but let's start it off well I
messed<00:03:04.490> up<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.970> was<00:03:05.240> kind<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.600> fail<00:03:05.720> I'm<00:03:06.500> going

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
messed up I was kind of a fail I'm going

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.830 
messed up I was kind of a fail I'm going
to<00:03:06.710> remove<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.100> repeater<00:03:07.520> because<00:03:08.510> it

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
to remove this repeater because it

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.900 
to remove this repeater because it
cannot<00:03:09.170> connect<00:03:09.530> into<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.800> side<00:03:10.040> repeater<00:03:10.490> now

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
cannot connect into a side repeater now

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.760 
cannot connect into a side repeater now
let's<00:03:11.030> try<00:03:11.180> this<00:03:11.240> again<00:03:14.410> notice<00:03:15.410> how<00:03:15.440> they're

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
let's try this again notice how they're

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.310 
let's try this again notice how they're
coming<00:03:15.890> out<00:03:16.130> in<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.460> little<00:03:16.670> ways<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:19.820> could

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
coming out in like little ways you could

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.920 
coming out in like little ways you could
do<00:03:21.320> something<00:03:21.620> else<00:03:22.280> which<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.510> know<00:03:23.630> what<00:03:23.780> I

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
do something else which you know what I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.120 
do something else which you know what I
might<00:03:24.200> as<00:03:24.260> well<00:03:24.350> show<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.800> this<00:03:24.890> tutorial

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
might as well show it in this tutorial

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.960 
might as well show it in this tutorial
as<00:03:25.580> well<00:03:27.220> what<00:03:28.220> we're<00:03:28.370> going<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.610> do<00:03:28.760> now

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
as well what we're going to do now

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.890 
as well what we're going to do now
actually<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:30.110> we're<00:03:30.470> going<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.709> take<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.310> out

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
actually is we're going to take this out

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.660 
actually is we're going to take this out
this<00:03:32.900> will<00:03:33.110> be<00:03:33.260> connected<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.250> bottom<00:03:34.550> one

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
this will be connected to the bottom one

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.060 
this will be connected to the bottom one
still<00:03:35.290> but<00:03:36.290> what<00:03:36.410> we're<00:03:36.530> actually<00:03:36.709> going<00:03:36.980> to

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
still but what we're actually going to

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.010 
still but what we're actually going to
do<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:38.110> we're<00:03:39.110> going<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.380> take<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:41.020> do

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
do is we're going to take this and do

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.170 
do is we're going to take this and do
this<00:03:42.050> off<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.770> separate<00:03:43.400> set<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.769> timers<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.940> we

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
this off a separate set of timers so we

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.460 
this off a separate set of timers so we
can<00:03:47.300> get<00:03:47.450> them<00:03:47.600> moving<00:03:47.810> at<00:03:48.050> a<00:03:48.080> little<00:03:48.350> bit

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
can get them moving at a little bit

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.250 
can get them moving at a little bit
different<00:03:48.800> pace<00:03:48.980> than<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.700> one<00:03:50.140> let's<00:03:51.140> make

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
different pace than the one let's make

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.680 
different pace than the one let's make
these<00:03:51.500> ones<00:03:51.800> about<00:03:52.640> same<00:03:54.640> golly<00:03:55.640> gotta<00:03:56.390> loops

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
these ones about same golly gotta loops

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:06.030 
these ones about same golly gotta loops
yep<00:03:57.410> yep<00:03:57.680> yep<00:03:58.550> yep<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.989> yeah<00:04:01.150> now<00:04:02.150> let's<00:04:03.459> maybe

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
yep yep yep yep and yeah now let's maybe

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.940 
yep yep yep yep and yeah now let's maybe
set<00:04:07.040> these<00:04:07.280> all<00:04:07.519> out<00:04:08.360> Blahniks<00:04:09.350> yeah<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:09.890> just

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
coming a lil bit faster but the more you

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.150 
coming a lil bit faster but the more you
grow<00:04:37.720> as<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.080> make<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.590> more<00:04:38.800> you'll<00:04:38.980> get

these and there was a like yours besides
let's<00:05:12.100> make<00:05:12.250> them<00:05:12.400> like<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.670> skull<00:05:12.970> small<00:05:13.420> scale

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
let's make them like a skull small scale

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.210 
let's make them like a skull small scale
right<00:05:14.500> there<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:16.650> there<00:05:17.650> was<00:05:17.800> like<00:05:17.950> walls
