we're going to talk a little bit about
an<00:00:14.070> important<00:00:14.519> consideration<00:00:14.790> when<00:00:15.450> looking

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
an important consideration when looking

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680 
an important consideration when looking
at<00:00:16.350> address<00:00:16.710> which<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.180> different<00:00:18.510> types

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
at address which is the different types

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.279 
at address which is the different types
of<00:00:18.900> patterns<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:20.310> consider<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.720> for

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
of patterns that you can consider so for

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.540 
of patterns that you can consider so for
Marin<00:00:22.970> as<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.619> worked<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:25.890> marin<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.490> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
Marin as I have worked with marin on a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.339 
Marin as I have worked with marin on a
couple<00:00:26.910> other<00:00:27.000> segments<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.660> i've<00:00:27.810> noted

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
couple other segments and i've noted

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
couple other segments and i've noted
that<00:00:28.500> she<00:00:28.680> has<00:00:28.859> angular<00:00:29.220> features<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.330> i

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that she has angular features and so i

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.810 
that she has angular features and so i
have<00:00:30.630> chosen<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.050> put<00:00:31.199> her<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:32.219> dress<00:00:32.489> that

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
have chosen to put her in a dress that

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.220 
have chosen to put her in a dress that
has<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> plaid<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.770> also<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.100> tweed<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.329> for

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
has a plaid and it's also a tweed so for

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.250 
has a plaid and it's also a tweed so for
me<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.010> elements<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.210> fabric<00:00:39.600> best

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
me the elements of that fabric best

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
me the elements of that fabric best
compliment<00:00:41.300> Marin's<00:00:42.300> features<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:44.280> she

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
compliment Marin's features in that she

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.930 
compliment Marin's features in that she
has<00:00:45.450> cool<00:00:45.870> skin<00:00:46.410> tones<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.370> gray<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
has cool skin tones I like the gray the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.779 
has cool skin tones I like the gray the
silver<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:49.050> nice<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.620> evening<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.280> her<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
silver it's nice for evening for her I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.689 
silver it's nice for evening for her I
think<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.719> plaid<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.800> classic<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
think that plaid is a very classic and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.990 
think that plaid is a very classic and
refined<00:00:54.600> pattern<00:00:55.559> works<00:00:56.219> perfectly<00:00:56.760> with

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
refined pattern works perfectly with

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.330 
refined pattern works perfectly with
Marin's<00:00:57.390> features<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.500> her<00:00:58.710> height<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
Marin's features as well in her height I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.979 
Marin's features as well in her height I
put<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> bias<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> very

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
put it on the bias that's also a very

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
put it on the bias that's also a very
interesting<00:01:03.989> trick<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.619> terms<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.430> creating

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
interesting trick in terms of creating

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.109 
interesting trick in terms of creating
length<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
length and also with and when you have a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.260 
length and also with and when you have a
figure<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.810> tall<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> thin

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
figure that's tall and thin

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.460 
figure that's tall and thin
interestingly<00:01:12.270> enough<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> draw

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
interestingly enough you do want to draw

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760 
interestingly enough you do want to draw
the<00:01:13.530> eye<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:15.390> create<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.530> sense

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the eye out as well to create the sense

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
the eye out as well to create the sense
of<00:01:16.890> proportion<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.759> balance<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.439> always<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
of proportion and balance so as always I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.789 
of proportion and balance so as always I
think<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.460> safe<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.939> trim<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.780> print<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
think it's safe to trim a print in a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.649 
think it's safe to trim a print in a
solid<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.030> never<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.270> wrong<00:01:24.420> with

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
solid and you can never go wrong with

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.340 
solid and you can never go wrong with
black<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.580> grace<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.630> demonstrate

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
black and here with grace to demonstrate

black and here with grace to demonstrate
yet<00:01:28.590> another<00:01:28.650> type<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.540> pattern<00:01:30.540> application

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
yet another type of pattern application

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.319 
yet another type of pattern application
when<00:01:31.740> you're<00:01:31.920> considering<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.700> dress<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> buy

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
when you're considering a dress to buy

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.950 
when you're considering a dress to buy
for<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> particular<00:01:34.079> type<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.500> body<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.840> for<00:01:36.840> me

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
for a particular type of body and for me

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.440 
for a particular type of body and for me
grace<00:01:37.259> represents<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.759> beautiful

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
grace represents the the beautiful

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
grace represents the the beautiful
opportunity<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.470> has<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> petite

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
opportunity that one has with a petite

opportunity that one has with a petite
figure<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> use<00:01:42.540> again<00:01:42.960> organic

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
figure which is to use again organic

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
figure which is to use again organic
rich<00:01:45.780> detail<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.700> very

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
rich detail but that it's it's very

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.940 
rich detail but that it's it's very
carefully<00:01:48.630> applied<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.500> small<00:01:49.619> amounts

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
carefully applied in very small amounts

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.910 
carefully applied in very small amounts
and<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:51.030> ways<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.360> will<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:51.930> overpower<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and in ways that will not overpower the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.340 
and in ways that will not overpower the
figure<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> notice<00:01:54.509> i<00:01:54.689> love<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> use

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
figure so if you notice i love the use

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.069 
figure so if you notice i love the use
of<00:01:55.380> lace<00:01:55.829> when<00:01:56.250> i'm<00:01:56.399> addressing<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
of lace when i'm addressing that kind of

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.410 
of lace when i'm addressing that kind of
issue<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.619> i<00:01:58.950> especially<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> break<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
issue and i especially like to break it

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.649 
issue and i especially like to break it
out<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.049> cut<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.070> re<00:02:02.850> applique<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> on

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
out and cut it up and re applique it on

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.429 
out and cut it up and re applique it on
to<00:02:03.869> address<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:06.270> case<00:02:06.570> again<00:02:07.110> i<00:02:07.140> like

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
to address and in this case again i like

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.969 
to address and in this case again i like
the<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.740> pure<00:02:08.009> line<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> petite

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
the on pure line on a petite

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.520 
the on pure line on a petite
figure<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.030> concentrated<00:02:10.479> up<00:02:11.080> around<00:02:11.349> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
figure so I concentrated up around the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.890 
figure so I concentrated up around the

skin<00:02:17.019> tones<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:20.430> spread<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.459> softly

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
skin tones and I then spread it softly

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.390 
skin tones and I then spread it softly
and<00:02:22.510> delicately<00:02:23.019> down<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.950> dress<00:02:24.159> and<00:02:24.310> it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
and delicately down the dress and it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.880 
and delicately down the dress and it
wraps<00:02:24.730> around<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.330> curves<00:02:25.660> around<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.349> once

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
wraps around and curves around and once

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.960 
wraps around and curves around and once
again<00:02:27.069> increases<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.390> length<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.970> bust

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
again increases the length of the bust

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.390 
again increases the length of the bust
to<00:02:31.390> floor<00:02:31.750> ratio<00:02:32.379> which<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.739> always<00:02:32.920> important

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
to floor ratio which is always important

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.850 
to floor ratio which is always important
to<00:02:33.430> consider<00:02:33.790> with<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> petite<00:02:34.420> figure<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.079> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
to consider with a petite figure and the

to consider with a petite figure and the
lace<00:02:36.099> again<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.819> good<00:02:37.180> type<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.349> pattern<00:02:38.650> to

lace again is a good type of pattern to

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
delicate small features so in conclusion

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.920 
delicate small features so in conclusion
