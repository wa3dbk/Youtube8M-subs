00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 us again the bulls and today we play 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.889
 minecraft today I will start immediately surfaced 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.940
 Here are the split reviews on Towncraft 4 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.420
 So a very big mod adds to the game. 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:23.580
 many different many magic all sorts of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.099
 new interesting items and so today 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 we will do such initial things 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.920
 which we need to study 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.390
 mod to start this mod adds to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.870
 the game of 8 new ores that's only 6 of them 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.190
 i.e. these are crystals 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 not break any pickaxe and even 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.329
 wooden but drops more crystals 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.590
 Of course if you break a diamond 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:58.649
 there is mtk better the more falls 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 crystals in this all and essence so let's 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:10.290
 it's all gonna break of course we will study 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.689
 This mod to I just show you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:22.520
 you like a llama how can you break easily 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.520
 wooden pickax here 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.990
 Well, that's all kind of collected further on 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.120
 we need 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.190
 but you need to make a book that will help 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.200
 our research is all that to us 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.200
 will be needed for today's review and 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:56.660
 so first make books 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.950
 Of course he could take them all the same way 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:06.950
 you never create interest yourself when 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.709
 Here we got three papers but Kraft 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.180
 depending on the version and changed 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:18.320
 currently craft books such 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:22.600
 164 so of course in 175 everything has changed 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.600
 but still doing bookshelf 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.820
 so further it is necessary to do down town 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:41.720
 tale monometer here it is made from one 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:44.920
 glass 2 ingots 2 gold ingots and 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.920
 of all the crystals 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.640
 here and so there then moments these moments 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.010
 further can make such a mixed 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.890
 crystalline entry we him too 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:12.060
 will do just as decoration so Tolman 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.319
 Midtown monitor is ready and so on to us 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.079
 we must first do our magic 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.040
 wand iron 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:22.790
 iron can make iron nuggets 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:29.220
 make them an iron tip 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:33.599
 further sticks forgot so still also 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.169
 we will make the table right away but I will not be enough 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:41.540
 there are not enough boards to hundred 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.540
 only on one table pancake 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.440
 so i'm gonna get some more boards on 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.440
 just in case 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.659
 we need three tables at least but 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.900
 Principally you are creative and 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:16.150
 we have one and enough okay then we will do 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:18.220
 our first wand she does so then 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.959
 have put a stick and obkladyvaetsya 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.130
 iron tips are obtained 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:28.389
 iron studded wooden rod like 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.580
 done all no no all also for the table 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.690
 we will need a written 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.680
 adaptation for this must be done 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.680
 bubble take pen and ink bag 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 it turns out 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:51.370
 scribe tools basically everything is now 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:55.949
 take but the principle looks like this 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:59.380
 mixed crystal cluster here 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:04.889
 further further in we add up all that to us 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.889
 don't need a bubble stick here 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.870
 like everything so let's do 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:20.700
 Thaumomonicon put a bookshelf on 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:26.640
 middle and click on it right 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:29.880
 open the book with the mouse button 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.910
 we have all this inventions 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.120
 all the information is magical 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.390
 aspects basic magic aspects 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.420
 who are in the game but they really 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.100
 here are just a bunch of aspects to learn 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.220
 these aspects need tolman meter aum no 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.330
 okay let's do the writing desk and 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.170
 magical you so to make 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.910
 magically places must be done like this 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.700
 just take a table click on it 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.520
 right-click wand was conducted 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.790
 magic workbench 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.340
 This workbench is basically nothing at all 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.620
 different from the usual workbench 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.050
 If in it to paint Kraft the same thing 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.000
 there may also come out of it 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.890
 nothing happens that is if we 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.550
 leave the items here he won't fall out 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.500
 here 's the whole secret but when we 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.480
 we will create magical things also 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.280
 will need a wand here will 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.660
 appear magical aspects of which 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.510
 will be taken from the wand 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.520
 but of course of course later on so we 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.070
 there were two right-handed tables 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.860
 mouse appeared writing desk in it 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.990
 all aspects are stored and accordingly 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.390
 pisyami tools that we 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:49.340
 write lay on paper see how 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:53.900
 all of them were not torn well here well well 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:58.040
 let's finish this issue today 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:01.920
 we made such a beautiful note 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.960
 made such a big step today and on 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.460
 this finish everyone thanks for watching and
