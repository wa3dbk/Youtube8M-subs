like<00:01:30.060> she's<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> slave<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.020> her<00:01:31.140> child<00:01:31.439> as

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
like she's a slave to her child as

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.719 
like she's a slave to her child as
opposed<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> being<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> other<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.700> around

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
opposed to being the other way around

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.999 
opposed to being the other way around
which<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.329> kind<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> funny<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.530> opinion<00:01:34.770> but

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
which is kind of funny in my opinion but

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
which is kind of funny in my opinion but
still<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> messed<00:01:36.720> up

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
still I think that's kind of messed up

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.319 
still I think that's kind of messed up
seriously<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.950> you're<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.759> you're<00:01:39.030> really

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
seriously if you're if you're really

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.030 
seriously if you're if you're really
giving<00:01:39.479> your<00:01:39.720> child<00:01:39.930> everything<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.770> want

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
giving your child everything they want

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
giving your child everything they want
how<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> feel<00:01:42.299> later<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.720> life

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
how are they going to feel later in life

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
how are they going to feel later in life
when<00:01:42.930> they<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.979> situation<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
when they get into a situation like I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.060 
when they get into a situation like I
don't<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> work<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.829> they<00:01:46.829> don't<00:01:46.890> want

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
don't know it work and they don't want

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.109 
don't know it work and they don't want
to<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.220> something<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.670> they<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.000> their

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
to do something and they don't get their

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.310 
to do something and they don't get their
way<00:01:48.180> they're<00:01:48.630> probably<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> get

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
way they're probably just going to get

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.749 
way they're probably just going to get
straight<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.740> fired<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.640> never

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
straight up fired because you never

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 
straight up fired because you never
taught<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.329> life<00:01:51.540> lessons<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.500> don't

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
taught them life lessons like you don't

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.350 
taught them life lessons like you don't

get what you want all the time because

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.090

enough and you're like a teenager
whatever<00:03:22.840> yeah<00:03:23.020> you<00:03:23.080> should<00:03:23.320> be<00:03:23.380> able<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.590> play

whatever yeah you should be able to play
this<00:03:23.860> game<00:03:24.010> but<00:03:24.310> most<00:03:25.210> people<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.690> I've<00:03:25.840> met

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
this game but most people that I've met

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.170 
this game but most people that I've met
are<00:03:26.260> definitely<00:03:26.830> not<00:03:27.040> mature<00:03:27.520> enough<00:03:27.550> at<00:03:28.000> that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
are definitely not mature enough at that

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.540 
are definitely not mature enough at that
age<00:03:28.390> definitely<00:03:29.170> not<00:03:29.350> at<00:03:29.590> eight<00:03:29.830> years<00:03:30.040> old<00:03:30.280> I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
age definitely not at eight years old I

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.000 
age definitely not at eight years old I
mean<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.990> last<00:03:32.170> time<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.440> met<00:03:32.530> him<00:03:32.740> as<00:03:32.890> her

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
mean the last time I met him as her

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.500 
mean the last time I met him as her
eight-year-old<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.790> can't<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.450> can't

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
eight-year-old well I can't I can't

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
eight-year-old well I can't I can't
remember<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.230> at<00:03:35.320> all<00:03:35.410> actually<00:03:35.680> but<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
remember it at all actually but the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.380 
remember it at all actually but the
other<00:03:38.890> argument<00:03:39.130> for<00:03:39.580> this<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.300> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
other argument for this and this is the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.550 
other argument for this and this is the
one<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.690> think<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.930> ridiculous<00:03:41.350> is<00:03:41.440> that

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
one that I think is ridiculous is that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.020 
one that I think is ridiculous is that
playing<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.890> violent<00:03:42.430> video<00:03:42.580> games<00:03:42.790> will

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
playing the violent video games will

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.210 
playing the violent video games will
make<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.360> child<00:03:43.660> violent<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:45.040> don't

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
make a child violent and I don't

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.580 
make a child violent and I don't
necessarily<00:03:45.700> agree<00:03:45.790> with<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.090> because<00:03:46.590> the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
necessarily agree with that because the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.290 
necessarily agree with that because the
obvious<00:03:47.920> examples<00:03:48.400> would<00:03:48.460> be<00:03:48.520> just<00:03:49.030> because<00:03:49.240> I

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
obvious examples would be just because I

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.000 
obvious examples would be just because I
play<00:03:49.360> cooking<00:03:49.810> mama<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.500> doesn't<00:03:50.770> make<00:03:50.830> me<00:03:50.980> a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
play cooking mama it doesn't make me a

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.950 
play cooking mama it doesn't make me a
chef<00:03:51.310> just<00:03:52.150> because<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.450> play<00:03:52.510> call<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.870> duty

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.690

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
doesn't mean I'm in the military or that

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.810 
doesn't mean I'm in the military or that
I'm<00:03:54.820> going<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.120> join<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.510> military<00:03:55.690> or<00:03:56.820> just

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
I don't know it could lead to violent

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.830 
I don't know it could lead to violent
tendencies<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.090> could<00:04:26.240> encourage<00:04:26.600> it<00:04:26.810> but

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
tendencies it could encourage it but

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.060 
tendencies it could encourage it but
it's<00:04:27.050> definitely<00:04:27.260> not<00:04:27.560> going<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.770> be<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.980> only

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
it's definitely not going to be the only

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.920 
it's definitely not going to be the only
cause<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:28.940> child's<00:04:29.510> not<00:04:29.630> going<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.840> become

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
cause that a child's not going to become

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.600 
cause that a child's not going to become
violent<00:04:30.320> just<00:04:30.740> because<00:04:30.980> of<00:04:31.100> grand<00:04:31.280> theft<00:04:31.370> auto

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
violent just because of grand theft auto

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.120 
violent just because of grand theft auto
5<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.240> mean<00:04:32.450> that's<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.410> little<00:04:33.620> ridiculous<00:04:33.800> of

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
5 I mean that's a little ridiculous of

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.550 
5 I mean that's a little ridiculous of
an<00:04:34.220> argument<00:04:34.640> but<00:04:34.850> I<00:04:35.120> don't<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:35.900> don't<00:04:35.930> know<00:04:36.530> I

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
an argument but I don't I don't know I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.840 
an argument but I don't I don't know I
just<00:04:36.680> don't<00:04:36.980> think<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.250> child<00:04:37.430> should<00:04:37.610> have

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
just don't think a child should have

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.370 
just don't think a child should have
this<00:04:38.000> kind<00:04:38.180> of<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.420> game<00:04:38.570> in<00:04:38.840> their<00:04:38.990> hands

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
this kind of a game in their hands

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.290 
this kind of a game in their hands
because<00:04:39.740> if<00:04:40.070> this<00:04:40.190> all<00:04:40.370> becomes<00:04:40.580> normal<00:04:41.150> to

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
because if this all becomes normal to

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.860 
because if this all becomes normal to
them<00:04:41.510> I<00:04:41.830> don't<00:04:42.830> know<00:04:42.890> it<00:04:43.070> seems<00:04:43.100> like<00:04:43.400> they

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.570 
them I don't know it seems like they
they<00:04:44.870> won't<00:04:45.110> really<00:04:45.290> care<00:04:45.380> at<00:04:45.830> all<00:04:45.950> when<00:04:46.340> stuff

much at all to blame on it it's all

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.500 
much at all to blame on it it's all
about<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.520> maturity<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.120> people<00:05:23.450> who

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
about the maturity of the people who

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.510 
about the maturity of the people who
play<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.750> game<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.830> if<00:05:25.130> you're<00:05:25.250> not<00:05:25.370> mature

humor in that game and they're going to

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.730 
humor in that game and they're going to
repeat<00:05:32.780> things<00:05:33.020> that<00:05:33.350> they<00:05:33.440> don't<00:05:33.620> even
