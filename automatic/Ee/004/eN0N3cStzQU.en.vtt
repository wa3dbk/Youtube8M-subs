00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.410
 there is a place between dimensions between 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.210
 worlds for some is the outside for 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.210
 others is the unknown 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.910
 for the majority however it is the void 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.730
 Despite its name, it is not a place 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.520
 low but the home of things 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.309
 unspeakable mistakes too terrible 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.680
 for the minds of men although this 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.720
 knowledge was lost long ago there 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.910
 who inadvertently discovers what 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.360
 that is hidden beyond and is incapable of 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 escape 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.329
 casarin is that creature 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.900
 He was once a man who was forced 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.010
 to contemplate the face of emptiness and it remained 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.769
 accepted forever by what he saw 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.110
 it was a seeker of forbidden knowledge but 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.759
 he discovered that what he craved 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.759
 little to do with what I imagined 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.040
 It is one of the few that has reached 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.560
 the forgotten and katia and has lived for 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.150
 tell it by following the tiny clues 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.150
 hidden in ancient texts 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.229
 inside a cyclopean city in 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.810
 cassady decadence found me secrets 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.250
 who will never share secrets that have 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.110
 made tremble with terror before 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.050
 visions that were imposed on him how much 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.060
 was going to happen in the future 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.030
 the power of that place threatened 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.120
 consume it but home who took the only 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.380
 available route if you wanted to survive 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.380
 He let the emptiness enter him 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.030
 miraculously he could overcome the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.340
 strange impulses that accompanied the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.190
 empty and emerged as something more than a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.400
 mere human 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.290
 although part of him died that day he knows 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.050
 that must protect value of beings 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.090
 they scratch the doors anxious company 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.090
 to enter and unleash the torment 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.140
 ah
