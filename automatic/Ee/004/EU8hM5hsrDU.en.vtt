00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.450
 empire again to prepare his strength for 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.210
 enslavement of our republic 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.580
 only your own hands and not a Jedi fate 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.580
 galaxies of all strength use your 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.309
 Good day, dear friends with 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.160
 you again perpetuum or alexander 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.350
 Jedi today I will show you the mod which 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.129
 adds amazing lights to the game 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.220
 swords 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.500
 adds blasters and also adds 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.080
 stupid imperials with whom you can 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 fight well let's take it in order and 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.580
 we must first consider how everyone 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.290
 you can still make a sword to 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.989
 to craft a sword by the way now I have 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.460
 black prefer black swords to us 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.870
 It will take 1 out of 9 rut these ores serve 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.479
 dyes for our lightsaber and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.060
 through this ore we choose the color 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.920
 our future sword can also 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.260
 create blocks of this ore which 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.020
 can be used in decorative 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 any direction also from this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.000
 ore can create ordinary armor 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.979
 conventional weapons but is it interesting 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.020
 does it need someone how much we already 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.210
 have seen such mods that do not carry 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.810
 nothing interesting just add 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 new useless ore meaningless and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.460
 merciless well then let's get started 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.560
 here's a craft from our swords to get us started 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 need to create a lens a lens 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.060
 itâ€™s very simple for us 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.159
 you need to build such a pyramid three 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960
 glass block 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.810
 next we need to create the top part 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.210
 our ball for this will require four 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 iron bars placed like this 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.829
 one lens 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.240
 1 redstone and one piece of gold 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.460
 it turns out the upper part I do not know how 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 specifically called this piece will 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.289
 call the top part further us 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.109
 need to create a bottom for 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.179
 of this we need three iron bars one 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.360
 power crystal I'll show you how it is 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.670
 looks and one gold bar 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.590
 power crystal looks like this with white 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.920
 color it burns when we are up to it 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.840
 touch but now apparently day and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.250
 so we can't see it on 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.510
 in fact they burn 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.770
 very beautiful burn go further for 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.110
 tip we need specifically 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.330
 here is this ore 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.910
 we go further we must create 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.160
 the heart of the sword can say the heart and 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 put something crystal which will 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.209
 give strength to the sword 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.190
 of color for this we will need four 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.709
 iron ingot and one of these 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.350
 amazing crystals as you see and 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.920
 chrome on 9 your sword can be kind 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.860
 blue can be neutral white or 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.870
 can be evil black well or orange 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.750
 sorry here is red no luck 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.780
 no luck no luck and in the end we 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.330
 move on we look like you can 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.520
 create blaster blaster is created too 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.260
 very simple we will need iron 4 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.650
 ingot and one lens 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.160
 and also 1 diamond turns out like this 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.049
 blaster but friends i forgot something we all 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760
 did not create a sword with you and now I 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.000
 show you how to create it for us 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.799
 all three of our components are required 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.310
 top part we put up in the middle in 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.450
 Centre 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.420
 and tip down further we postpone 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.049
 this is also a six sword 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.910
 iron bars and we get 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.280
 real swords yes 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.200
 if you are tired of seeing this sword 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.400
 you can hide it by clicking on 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.310
 f key press f key and sword 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.800
 hides click again from amazing 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.050
 pleasant sound it appears again and you 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.320
 you can chop the enemies again 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.190
 cut off the legs and arms of the other 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.800
 body parts also mod adds three new 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.540
 mob first about this stupid storm 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.080
 corpse that can by the way kill 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.560
 see yourself he killed himself 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.330
 miracles maybe that's just me 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.890
 perhaps the mod has not been finalized yet 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.530
 less potential there are they 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.140
 kill themselves they think I'm super 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.200
 cool is it from despair just 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.820
 shoot yourself a temple it's weird but in 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.810
 this time on shoots just the ground 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.460
 let's shoot him from our blaster 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.810
 our blaster shoots very fast for 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.120
 to shoot a blaster 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.910
 You will need such batteries to 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.420
 Sorry nowhere found the crafting of these 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.240
 batteries 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.430
 even on minecraft's official forum 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.780
 section of this mod is nothing about 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.530
 Battery unspeakably unfortunately so forth 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.550
 goes evok we all remember this nice 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.590
 furry animal 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.340
 who lives on one of the satellites 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.440
 indoor and satellite wooded 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.169
 Endor Endor and in fact before on my planet 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.120
 was called but in fact this innocuous could 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.160
 he won't touch us you can just 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.710
 to kill him and can fall out of him 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.900
 something interesting is added to us in 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.360
 java game 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.580
 these mobs we all remember too well 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.800
 these 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.630
 movie characters were some mechanics 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.830
 and traded droids and they lived on 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.290
 Tattoo planet let's kill it 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.560
 sand falls out of it is strange because 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.570
 tattooin is a sandy planet in general this 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.880
 all that adds today's mod on 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.860
 in fact, he is very cool to me wildly 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.200
 I liked it and now I will constantly 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.100
 Jedi and meanwhile with you was 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.230
 perpetuum fight with the republic 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.810
 get strength protect the weak and 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.810
 power will be with you until new encounters
