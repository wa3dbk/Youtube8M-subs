00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.350
 expensive 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.599
 we finally know what the android app is for 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 it is actually still a music 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.009
 streaming service gone online a 3d 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.690
 foto kickstarter project and we have 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.880
 a ei phone 7 so a wish iphone 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:25.800
 she is and a bit more 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.480
 now intern news we have after 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.920
 Browse new crowdfunding projects 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.260
 and are looking at an interesting one 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.210
 campaign on kickstarter poked the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.550
 with photos in new dimensions 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.020
 So I want to be in the third to exactly 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.760
 his camera called the bible scans 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.649
 namely the motives with a laser 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.149
 and builds on the data gained 3d 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.340
 object then also with 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.300
 is assigned the corresponding textures 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.829
 You can then choose from different ones 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.719
 view perspectives 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.920
 so it really seems to be out too 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.840
 his stereoscopic 3d films spherical 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.660
 360 Â° videos virtual reality and now 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.289
 also still 3d images the combination 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.910
 everyone would be interesting too 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.420
 What would you do for the internet? 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420
 use 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.790
 just for that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.210
 netflix has turned to the price screw 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.180
 and its standard fare with two 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.430
 devices from 899 to 999 at the same time 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.979
 raised the prices for basic and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.619
 premium remain however with 7 99 resp 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.780
 But be careful before you all now 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.220
 your netflix account deactivates the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 Price increase applies only to new customers 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.590
 all who are already registered pay 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.750
 still the known eight euro 99 is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.430
 So only a matter of time until 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.780
 They also increase this for existing customers 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.670
 netflix justifies the price increases 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 By the way so that so the offer 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 series films and own productions 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.729
 can also be extended in the future 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.560
 Well, then we are curious if 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.390
 the exter euro then really in the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.130
 offer reflects we would 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.369
 looking forward 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.369
 I think so 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 so if we look at anything in 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.440
 Last time not really waiting 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.050
 then yes probably have a new one 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.960
 streaming service and yet is with boom 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.040
 now another spotify app music 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.020
 this camp webster play music xbox 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.040
 music a competitor at the start 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.420
 gone though it is 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.490
 business model really something new 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.870
 because of the revenue 90 percent 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.490
 to go to the artists 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.470
 Maybe then maybe 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.180
 really more than a few problems 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.160
 Cent at the artists land for the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.750
 The offer will be great for labels, though 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.490
 rather uninteresting but for 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.290
 smaller artists and for people who 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.060
 beyond the mainstream also like 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.590
 you can bum bent maybe 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.120
 be worth a look as we did with the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 band le fly but already discussed 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.050
 you should have the distribution 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.700
 when streaming under circumstances again 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.320
 think about it just when you see how 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.940
 inflated the market entry to be 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.590
 We'll be back soon 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.060
 a special on the topic of streaming services 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.200
 make and compare with each other 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.820
 so if you have questions and tips 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.920
 She likes to write us down in the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.680
 Comments 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.570
 Are you doing with what are you doing ? 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.730
 when I was up exclusively in san francisco 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.739
 the google i / o was already speculated 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.950
 could arise for the android 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.550
 jam m &amp; ms or almond croissants 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.260
 and also whether it's Android 5.2 or 6.0 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.260
 would be still unclear 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.070
 but now the secret became solemn 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.930
 by revealing a statue of google 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.510
 headquarter aired and there is now 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.550
 next to cupcakes lollipops frozen yogurt 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.220
 now also an Android with one 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.959
 marshmallow the version number is increasing 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.140
 from lollipop to marshmallow then 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.130
 by the way, from currently 5.1 to 6.0 it 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.320
 So it's about one 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.060
 extensive update all info and 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.030
 Updates to the new android you can find 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.940

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.890
 what do you have to do with recipients that is 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.660
 the checker move the apple keynote in the 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.580

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.310
 net turns over with rumors and 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.410
 alleged insider infos from over and 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.350

 what the internet supposedly already knows 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.060
 and there we thought oh who 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.829

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.510
