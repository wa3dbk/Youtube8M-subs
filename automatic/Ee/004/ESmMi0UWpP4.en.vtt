00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.080 
to make that happen that's going to be
my<00:05:05.000> first<00:05:05.240> step<00:05:05.660> of<00:05:08.170> regaining<00:05:09.370> control<00:05:10.370> over

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090

my first step of regaining control over
this<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:13.750> because<00:05:14.750> in<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.050> past<00:05:15.310> just

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
this and because in the past just

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.860 
this and because in the past just
watching<00:05:16.700> videos<00:05:17.090> has<00:05:17.390> been<00:05:17.570> enough

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
watching videos has been enough

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.380 
watching videos has been enough
inspiration<00:05:18.560> for<00:05:19.160> me<00:05:19.310> but<00:05:19.580> for<00:05:19.730> some<00:05:19.940> reason

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
inspiration for me but for some reason

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.950 
inspiration for me but for some reason
it<00:05:20.570> it<00:05:21.500> hasn't<00:05:21.770> been<00:05:22.419> over<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.510> past<00:05:23.540> couple

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960
