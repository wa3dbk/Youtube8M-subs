considerably longer than happy and with

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.300 
considerably longer than happy and with

all the spaces and all that so now I'm

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.220 
all the spaces and all that so now I'm
much<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.550> talk<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:27.200> we're<00:02:28.200> just

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
much to talk about right now we're just

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.170 
much to talk about right now we're just
working<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.890> letters<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.790> that's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
working on the letters that this that's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.020 
working on the letters that this that's
pretty<00:02:30.630> much<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.870> yeah<00:02:31.280> what<00:02:32.280> would<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.790> out

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
pretty much it yeah what would this out

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.690 
pretty much it yeah what would this out
right<00:02:33.240> yeah<00:02:33.900> hopefully<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.950> think<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.520> was<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
right yeah hopefully I think it was a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.560 
right yeah hopefully I think it was a
really<00:02:35.940> brilliant<00:02:36.240> idea<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:38.030> punch<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
really brilliant idea to punch out the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.390 
really brilliant idea to punch out the
lettering<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.500> refill<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.220> later

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
lettering and then refill it later

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.700 
lettering and then refill it later
because<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.820> know<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:42.900> idea<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.590> was

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
because I know that was your idea it was

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.670 
because I know that was your idea it was
like<00:02:43.860> addition<00:02:44.400> by<00:02:44.580> subtraction<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:46.530> don't

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
like addition by subtraction we don't

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.280 
like addition by subtraction we don't
possible<00:02:47.270> we<00:02:48.270> need<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.510> add<00:02:48.660> some<00:02:48.690> more<00:02:49.080> white

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
possible we need to add some more white

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.160 
possible we need to add some more white
blocks<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.250> left<00:02:50.280> side<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.050> know

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
blocks on the left side so that you know

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.050 
blocks on the left side so that you know
the<00:02:52.440> lettuce<00:02:53.100> won't<00:02:53.280> be<00:02:53.400> squished<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.820> against

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
the lettuce won't be squished up against

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.120 
the lettuce won't be squished up against
the<00:02:54.120> edge<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:55.230> add<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.650> three<00:02:55.920> rows

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the edge so I just add like three rows

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.760 
the edge so I just add like three rows
there<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.700> here<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.170> selected<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
there and here I I just selected it and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.280 
there and here I I just selected it and
replace<00:02:59.310> all<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.910> air<00:03:00.090> within<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.660> block<00:03:00.870> or

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
replace all the air within that block or

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.830 
replace all the air within that block or
within<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.650> section<00:03:01.950> with<00:03:02.310> blue<00:03:02.820> hole<00:03:03.090> so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
within that section with blue hole so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.750 
within that section with blue hole so
the<00:03:04.110> letters<00:03:04.410> stand<00:03:04.440> out<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.010> didn't<00:03:05.700> you
