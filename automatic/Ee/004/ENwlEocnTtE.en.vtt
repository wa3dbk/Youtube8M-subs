so<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:46.550> got<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.970> Mouse<00:00:56.420> that's<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.630> trap<00:00:57.900> I

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
so I got one Mouse that's the trap I

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
so I got one Mouse that's the trap I
used<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:04.380> preference<00:01:05.240> don't<00:01:06.240> use<00:01:06.450> these

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
used so my preference don't use these

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.500 
used so my preference don't use these
traps<00:01:07.190> use<00:01:08.190> these<00:01:08.460> ones<00:01:13.460> these<00:01:14.460> traps<00:01:14.850> seem

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
traps use these ones these traps seem

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.109 
traps use these ones these traps seem
way<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.110> effective<00:01:16.380> than<00:01:17.160> these<00:01:17.430> traps<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
way more effective than these traps I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.140 
way more effective than these traps I
use<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.440> like<00:01:19.650> six<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.580> seven<00:01:21.119> times

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
use this one but like six or seven times

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.050 
use this one but like six or seven times
I<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.840> know<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.260> this<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.160> used<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.640> once
