00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.819 
need to find a spare half a day or so to
actually<00:00:39.149> build<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.690> remember<00:00:40.350> guys<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
actually build it remember guys this is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.160 
actually build it remember guys this is
my<00:00:40.980> first<00:00:41.219> pc<00:00:41.670> build<00:00:41.879> I've<00:00:42.090> ever<00:00:42.270> done<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.020> it's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
my first pc build I've ever done so it's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.660 
my first pc build I've ever done so it's
a<00:00:43.230> big<00:00:43.410> bigger<00:00:43.620> learning<00:00:44.040> step<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.460> me<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
a big bigger learning step for me the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.279 
a big bigger learning step for me the
big<00:00:44.789> big<00:00:44.969> learning<00:00:45.360> curve<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.230> to

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
big big learning curve so it's going to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.319 
big big learning curve so it's going to
take<00:00:46.469> some<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.579> before<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> start

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
take some time so before I start

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.729 
take some time so before I start
anything<00:00:48.539> else<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.050> video<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.590> want

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
anything else on this video I just want

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.369 
anything else on this video I just want
to<00:00:49.860> ask<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.309> guys<00:00:50.480> what<00:00:51.480> kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> format<00:00:52.140> John

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to ask you guys what kind of format John

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
to ask you guys what kind of format John
I<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> building<00:00:53.129> would<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> rather<00:00:53.579> me

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I see the building would you rather me

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.369 
I see the building would you rather me
like<00:00:54.000> time-lapse<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.110> talk<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
like time-lapse it and then talk a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.600 
like time-lapse it and then talk a
little<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.800> about<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> end<00:00:56.250> about<00:00:56.370> my

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
little bit about the end about my

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.389 
little bit about the end about my
experiences<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> learned<00:00:59.070> from

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
experiences what I kind of learned from

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.619 
experiences what I kind of learned from
it<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> think<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.210> could<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.480> better

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
it and what I think I could do better

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.349 
it and what I think I could do better
next<00:01:00.989> time<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.620> would<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> rather<00:01:02.520> me<00:01:02.969> kind<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
next time or would you rather me kind of

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
next time or would you rather me kind of
break<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.719> down<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:04.170> segments<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.739> actually

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
break it down into segments and actually

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
break it down into segments and actually
show<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.220> guys<00:01:05.519> installing<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> parts<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
show you guys installing the parts the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
show you guys installing the parts the
reason<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.159> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> leaning<00:01:08.610> towards<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
reason I'm kind of leaning towards the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
reason I'm kind of leaning towards the
time-lapse<00:01:09.659> part<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.170> people<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
time-lapse part is people really like to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
time-lapse part is people really like to
see<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> time-lapse<00:01:11.760> builds<00:01:12.270> over<00:01:12.479> time<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
see the time-lapse builds over time and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.410 
see the time-lapse builds over time and
obviously<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.979> my<00:01:14.040> first<00:01:14.460> build<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> give

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
obviously it's my first build so to give

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
obviously it's my first build so to give
you<00:01:15.540> guys<00:01:15.720> some<00:01:15.900> feedback<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.409> my<00:01:16.890> learning

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you guys some feedback and my learning

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
you guys some feedback and my learning
curve<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:18.330> learning<00:01:18.720> points<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.140> end

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
curve and my learning points at the end

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.340 
curve and my learning points at the end
of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> video<00:01:19.590> seems<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> best<00:01:20.430> way<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> go

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
of the video seems the best way to go

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.600 
of the video seems the best way to go
rather<00:01:22.350> than<00:01:22.590> obviously<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.340> first

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
rather than obviously this is my first

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 
rather than obviously this is my first
pc<00:01:24.030> Biltz<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.540> mean<00:01:24.720> installing<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> part<00:01:25.530> could

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
pc Biltz I mean installing a part could

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
pc Biltz I mean installing a part could
take<00:01:25.979> forever<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:27.479> probably<00:01:27.930> leaning<00:01:28.290> in

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
take forever so I'm probably leaning in

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.960 
take forever so I'm probably leaning in
towards<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.740> time<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.280> part<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
towards the time that's part so if you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
towards the time that's part so if you
guys<00:01:30.090> want<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:30.750> naps<00:01:31.020> bloke<00:01:31.950> version<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
guys want the time naps bloke version of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
guys want the time naps bloke version of
