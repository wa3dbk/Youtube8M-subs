today<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.950> right<00:00:17.430> now<00:00:17.550> we're<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.790> be

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
today and right now we're going to be

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.550 
today and right now we're going to be
taking<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> look<00:00:18.360> at<00:00:18.510> forwards<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.170> backwards

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
taking a look at forwards to backwards

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
taking a look at forwards to backwards
transitions<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.119> when<00:00:21.390> you're

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
transitions so that is when you're

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.480 
transitions so that is when you're
skating<00:00:21.720> forward<00:00:22.290> being<00:00:22.890> able<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.189> switch

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
skating forward being able to switch

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.429 
skating forward being able to switch
going<00:00:23.790> from<00:00:24.420> forwards<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.840> backwards<00:00:25.230> without

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
going from forwards to backwards without

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.660 
going from forwards to backwards without
stopping<00:00:25.950> we're<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> take<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> look<00:00:26.580> at

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
stopping we're going to take a look at

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.160 
stopping we're going to take a look at
that<00:00:26.820> show<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> how<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.630> I'll<00:00:27.990> break

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
that show you how to do that I'll break

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
that show you how to do that I'll break
down<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> features<00:00:28.950> about<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.640> give

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
down all the features about it and give

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.160 
down all the features about it and give
you<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.150> good<00:00:30.300> examples<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.840> technique

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
you some good examples and technique

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
you some good examples and technique
this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.920> quick<00:00:32.129> example<00:00:32.220> of<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.790> front<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
this is a quick example of a front to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.900 
this is a quick example of a front to
back<00:00:33.239> transition

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.310 

don't<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:43.600> start<00:00:43.840> off<00:00:43.930> with<00:00:44.050> your<00:00:44.170> feet

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
don't you start off with your feet

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.100 
don't you start off with your feet
parallel<00:00:44.820> tion<00:00:45.820> with<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.090> part<00:00:46.329> drifting

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
parallel tion with the part drifting

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.569 
parallel tion with the part drifting
along<00:00:47.200> forward<00:00:47.590> at<00:00:47.680> a<00:00:47.710> comfortable<00:00:48.040> speed<00:00:48.340> not

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
along forward at a comfortable speed not

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:59.500 
along forward at a comfortable speed not
too<00:00:48.730> fast<00:00:48.970> not<00:00:49.210> too<00:00:49.270> slowly

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.210 

so<00:00:59.660> I'm<00:00:59.780> gonna<00:00:59.930> take<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.200> look<00:01:00.410> at<00:01:00.559> now<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.950> where

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
so I'm gonna take a look at now is where

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.290 
so I'm gonna take a look at now is where
your<00:01:01.370> weights<00:01:01.520> going<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.790> be<00:01:01.880> within<00:01:02.149> the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
your weights going to be within the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.530 
your weights going to be within the
front<00:01:02.510> aback<00:01:02.720> transitions<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:05.089> you<00:01:05.150> start<00:01:05.420> by

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
front aback transitions so you start by

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.940 
front aback transitions so you start by
skating<00:01:05.780> with<00:01:05.960> your<00:01:06.080> feet<00:01:06.229> parallel<00:01:06.560> with

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
skating with your feet parallel with

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.770 
skating with your feet parallel with
sorry<00:01:07.760> power<00:01:07.940> down<00:01:08.090> from<00:01:08.270> each<00:01:08.390> other<00:01:08.600> and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
sorry power down from each other and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.910 
sorry power down from each other and
also<00:01:08.869> about<00:01:09.110> shoulder-width<00:01:09.530> apart

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
also about shoulder-width apart

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.590 
also about shoulder-width apart
now<00:01:10.550> what's<00:01:10.700> can<00:01:10.820> happen<00:01:10.850> first<00:01:11.240> is<00:01:11.420> your

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
now what's can happen first is your

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.960 
now what's can happen first is your
weight<00:01:12.380> onto<00:01:12.740> your<00:01:12.890> dominant<00:01:13.520> leg<00:01:13.550> so<00:01:13.940> that

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
weight onto your dominant leg so that

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.670 
weight onto your dominant leg so that
might<00:01:14.210> be<00:01:14.360> your<00:01:14.479> left<00:01:14.690> but<00:01:15.050> in<00:01:15.140> my<00:01:15.290> case<00:01:15.350> that's

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
might be your left but in my case that's

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.260 
might be your left but in my case that's
my<00:01:15.890> right<00:01:16.160> so<00:01:16.729> I'll<00:01:16.820> show<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.119> tutorial

you<00:01:19.610> begin<00:01:19.850> by<00:01:19.970> skating<00:01:20.300> along<00:01:20.540> as<00:01:20.630> we<00:01:20.720> said

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
you begin by skating along as we said

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.630 
you begin by skating along as we said
most<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.740> your<00:01:21.890> weight<00:01:21.979> gets<00:01:22.130> transferred<00:01:22.520> to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
most of your weight gets transferred to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.980 
most of your weight gets transferred to
this<00:01:22.729> foot<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.090> do<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.390> by<00:01:23.540> just<00:01:23.780> slightly

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
this foot you do that by just slightly

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.650 
this foot you do that by just slightly
leaning<00:01:24.400> onto<00:01:25.400> your<00:01:25.550> right<00:01:25.910> knee<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.479> puts

all the way pairs you can see this foot
can<00:01:28.130> be<00:01:28.190> lifted<00:01:28.310> off<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.580> ground<00:01:28.610> quite

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
can be lifted off the ground quite

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.820 
can be lifted off the ground quite
easily<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.960> whilst<00:01:30.140> here<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.470> position

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
easily and whilst here in this position

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.170 
easily and whilst here in this position
you<00:01:30.920> let<00:01:31.070> your<00:01:31.400> right<00:01:31.580> foot<00:01:31.820> which<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.000> your

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
you let your right foot which is your

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.210 
you let your right foot which is your
dominant<00:01:32.270> leg<00:01:32.600> drift<00:01:33.110> out<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.289> little<00:01:33.530> bit<00:01:33.710> as

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
dominant leg drift out a little bit as

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.850 
dominant leg drift out a little bit as
you<00:01:34.460> turn<00:01:34.729> your<00:01:34.759> left<00:01:35.119> leg<00:01:35.330> in<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.740> goes

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
you turn your left leg in so it goes

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.950 
you turn your left leg in so it goes
into<00:01:37.100> our<00:01:37.220> most<00:01:37.369> OB<00:01:37.729> shape<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.630> from<00:01:38.810> this

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
into our most OB shape and from this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.940 
into our most OB shape and from this
position<00:01:39.140> I'll<00:01:39.470> show<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.619> what<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:39.770> looks

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
position I'll show you what this looks

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.050 
position I'll show you what this looks
up<00:01:40.070> while<00:01:40.220> you're<00:01:40.369> moving<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.700> we'll<00:01:40.850> move<00:01:40.940> on

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
up while you're moving it we'll move on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.770 
up while you're moving it we'll move on
to<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.240> next<00:01:41.330> bit

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:02:05.620 

that's<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.560> first<00:01:48.800> part

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.810 

so<00:02:06.260> first<00:02:06.500> white<00:02:06.680> as<00:02:06.800> we<00:02:06.890> said<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.490> he's<00:02:07.640> had

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
so first white as we said and he's had

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.580 
so first white as we said and he's had
your<00:02:08.030> legs<00:02:08.179> shoulder-width<00:02:08.960> apart<00:02:08.990> parallel

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
your legs shoulder-width apart parallel

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.320 
your legs shoulder-width apart parallel
to<00:02:09.920> each<00:02:10.039> other<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.789> put<00:02:10.940> your<00:02:11.030> weight<00:02:11.150> onto

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
to each other and put your weight onto

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
out slightly as your right foot slowly

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.370 
out slightly as your right foot slowly
turns<00:02:15.940> what<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.060> looks<00:02:17.240> like<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.660> dominant

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
turns what that looks like is dominant

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.110 
turns what that looks like is dominant
foot<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.770> one<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.160> me<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:20.000> out

slightly<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:20.540> my<00:02:20.660> weight<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:21.050> this<00:02:21.170> leg<00:02:21.230> this

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
slightly with my weight on this leg this

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.770 
slightly with my weight on this leg this
foot<00:02:22.220> slowly<00:02:22.490> turns<00:02:22.910> as<00:02:23.180> these<00:02:23.390> less<00:02:23.570> weight

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
foot slowly turns as these less weight

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.600 
foot slowly turns as these less weight
on<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.050> very<00:02:24.110> easy<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.620> turn<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:24.950> once<00:02:25.520> you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
on it's very easy to turn it once you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.670 
on it's very easy to turn it once you
get<00:02:25.730> into<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.000> position<00:02:26.080> you're<00:02:27.080> slowly<00:02:27.320> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
get into this position you're slowly to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.500 
get into this position you're slowly to
then<00:02:27.830> lean<00:02:28.040> onto<00:02:28.340> your<00:02:28.520> other<00:02:28.730> leg<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.180> my<00:02:29.300> case

being my left leg so I'll move the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.350 
being my left leg so I'll move the
weight<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.430> there<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.940> there<00:02:32.030> by<00:02:32.180> just

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
weight from there to there by just

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.420 
weight from there to there by just
leaning<00:02:32.570> onto<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.080> knee<00:02:33.290> I'll<00:02:34.190> show<00:02:34.340> you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
leaning onto this knee I'll show you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:46.120 
leaning onto this knee I'll show you
what<00:02:34.520> comes<00:02:34.640> after<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:44.770> now<00:02:45.770> what<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.010> can

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
what comes after that now what you can

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.010 
what comes after that now what you can
see<00:02:46.190> there<00:02:46.580> was<00:02:47.060> all<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.390> my<00:02:47.510> weight<00:02:47.660> being<00:02:47.930> on

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
see there was all of my weight being on

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.690 
see there was all of my weight being on
my<00:02:48.080> dominant<00:02:48.470> leg<00:02:48.620> while<00:02:49.190> my<00:02:49.310> right<00:02:49.520> leg

my dominant leg while my right leg

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.820 
my dominant leg while my right leg
slowly<00:02:50.150> started<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.630> turn<00:02:50.930> into<00:02:51.230> what<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.590> call

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
slowly started to turn into what I call

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.530 
slowly started to turn into what I call
the<00:02:51.980> boomerang<00:02:52.400> position<00:02:52.880> or<00:02:53.090> maybe<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.360> B

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the boomerang position or maybe a B

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.940 
the boomerang position or maybe a B
position<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.080> might<00:02:54.170> like<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.500> say<00:02:54.650> and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
position you might like to say and

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.460

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
my dominant leg and once you get

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.460 
my dominant leg and once you get
probably<00:03:01.820> about<00:03:02.060> say<00:03:02.600> 90<00:03:02.900> degrees<00:03:03.110> into<00:03:03.350> the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
turn this position so you're traveling

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.390 
turn this position so you're traveling
that<00:03:05.840> way<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.260> you're<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.739> 90<00:03:06.950> degree<00:03:07.130> angle

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.030 
from the position you're traveling in
you<00:03:09.140> need<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.350> put<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.590> weight<00:03:09.739> onto<00:03:09.920> your

you need to put the weight onto your

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.610 
you need to put the weight onto your
left<00:03:10.640> leg<00:03:10.880> as<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.209> lift<00:03:11.720> your<00:03:11.989> right<00:03:12.200> leg<00:03:12.440> up

in<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.250> parallel<00:03:16.730> line<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.930> go<00:03:18.080> from

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
in a parallel line so you go from

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.440 
in a parallel line so you go from
straight<00:03:18.590> forward<00:03:19.120> weight<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.330> leg

just going to take a look at the second

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.510 
just going to take a look at the second
part<00:03:35.110> after<00:03:35.350> you've<00:03:35.650> got<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:35.890> in<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.100> V<00:03:36.250> shape

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
part after you've got it in the V shape

part after you've got it in the V shape
or<00:03:36.730> boomerang<00:03:37.240> shape<00:03:37.420> I'm<00:03:37.540> going<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.720> show<00:03:37.810> you

so<00:03:47.060> what<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.209> did<00:03:47.299> over<00:03:47.540> there<00:03:47.780> we<00:03:48.260> went<00:03:48.409> from

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
so what I did over there we went from

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.380 
so what I did over there we went from
the<00:03:49.040> v-shape<00:03:49.459> all<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.670> boomerang<00:03:49.969> shape<00:03:50.150> as<00:03:50.299> I

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
the v-shape all the boomerang shape as I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.539 
the v-shape all the boomerang shape as I
said<00:03:50.540> earlier<00:03:50.780> on<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.739> my<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.189> that<00:03:52.310> position

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
said earlier on so my in that position

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.429 
said earlier on so my in that position
my<00:03:52.939> weight<00:03:53.120> was<00:03:53.269> in<00:03:53.420> my<00:03:53.569> right<00:03:54.019> leg<00:03:54.049> which<00:03:54.409> is

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
my weight was in my right leg which is

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.949 
my weight was in my right leg which is
my<00:03:54.680> dominant<00:03:54.890> leg<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.489> as<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.879> get<00:03:56.060> almost

facing the direction you're traveling in

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.050 
facing the direction you're traveling in
you<00:04:10.670> see<00:04:10.819> you<00:04:10.909> go<00:04:11.030> from<00:04:11.299> forwards<00:04:12.909> rim<00:04:13.909> row

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
you see you go from forwards rim row

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.779 
you see you go from forwards rim row
position<00:04:14.239> if<00:04:15.049> anything<00:04:15.469> will<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:15.620> go<00:04:15.799> the

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
position if anything will you go the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.920 
position if anything will you go the
direction<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.209> your<00:04:17.359> heels<00:04:17.509> are<00:04:17.660> facing

direction that your heels are facing

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.969 
direction that your heels are facing
after<00:04:18.259> you've<00:04:18.350> turned<00:04:18.500> around<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.889> the

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
after you've turned around is the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.229 
after you've turned around is the
direction<00:04:19.280> you're<00:04:19.370> gonna<00:04:19.459> go<00:04:19.639> in<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:20.030> need<00:04:20.150> to

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
direction you're gonna go in you need to

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.099 
direction you're gonna go in you need to
make<00:04:20.359> sure<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:20.630> your<00:04:20.750> feet<00:04:20.930> are<00:04:20.959> parallel

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
make sure that your feet are parallel

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.439 
make sure that your feet are parallel
with<00:04:21.709> support<00:04:22.099> and<00:04:22.280> shoulder<00:04:22.940> width<00:04:23.060> apart<00:04:23.090> as

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
with support and shoulder width apart as

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.700 
with support and shoulder width apart as
well<00:04:23.599> so<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.840> don't<00:04:23.990> have<00:04:24.110> any<00:04:24.289> problems<00:04:24.590> with

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
well so you don't have any problems with

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.320 
well so you don't have any problems with
you<00:04:24.860> knocking<00:04:25.430> into<00:04:25.759> your<00:04:25.880> skaters<00:04:26.210> you're

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
you knocking into your skaters you're

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.520 
you knocking into your skaters you're
going<00:04:26.479> backwards<00:04:26.870> cuz<00:04:26.990> if<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.139> have<00:04:27.349> them

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
going backwards cuz if you have them

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.320 
going backwards cuz if you have them
facing<00:04:27.949> that<00:04:28.099> way<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.669> eventually<00:04:29.060> back<00:04:29.180> up

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
facing that way and eventually back up

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.989 
facing that way and eventually back up
into<00:04:29.570> each<00:04:29.660> other<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.960> want<00:04:30.110> them<00:04:30.259> parallel

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:37.999 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.089 

so<00:04:38.779> the<00:04:38.869> final<00:04:39.199> step<00:04:39.289> is<00:04:39.499> we<00:04:39.619> said<00:04:39.829> that

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
so the final step is we said that

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.639 
so the final step is we said that
involves<00:04:40.549> having<00:04:41.179> your<00:04:41.569> legs<00:04:41.749> in<00:04:42.019> the<00:04:42.199> V<00:04:42.379> shape

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:42.649 
involves having your legs in the V shape

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.199 
involves having your legs in the V shape
of<00:04:42.799> the<00:04:42.860> boomerang<00:04:43.249> shape<00:04:43.519> and<00:04:43.759> you

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:44.209 
of the boomerang shape and you

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
of the boomerang shape and you
transferring<00:04:44.809> the<00:04:44.869> weight<00:04:44.989> from<00:04:45.169> your

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
transferring the weight from your

transferring the weight from your
dominant<00:04:45.709> leg<00:04:45.739> to<00:04:46.399> the<00:04:46.549> other<00:04:46.729> leg

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:47.239 
dominant leg to the other leg

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:48.969 
dominant leg to the other leg
in<00:04:47.360> my<00:04:47.569> case<00:04:47.629> my<00:04:47.839> dominance<00:04:48.349> my<00:04:48.529> right<00:04:48.739> leg<00:04:48.949> and

in my case my dominance my right leg and

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.350 
in my case my dominance my right leg and
I<00:04:49.159> transfer<00:04:49.519> in<00:04:49.579> the<00:04:49.639> way<00:04:49.759> bottom<00:04:50.209> in<00:04:50.299> the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
I transfer in the way bottom in the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.019 
I transfer in the way bottom in the
boomerang<00:04:50.809> turn<00:04:51.049> to<00:04:51.649> my<00:04:51.799> left<00:04:51.829> leg<00:04:52.279> you<00:04:52.879> then

so now I'm just going to show you the
forwards<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.490> backwards<00:05:15.819> transition<00:05:16.360> full

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
forwards to backwards transition full

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.929 
forwards to backwards transition full
body<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:17.379> a<00:05:17.650> little<00:05:17.919> bit<00:05:18.069> slowly<00:05:18.310> sentencing

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:18.939 
body and a little bit slowly sentencing

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:20.490 
body and a little bit slowly sentencing
on<00:05:19.060> being<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.599> now<00:05:19.719> they're<00:05:19.900> lower<00:05:20.110> quickly

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
on being and now they're lower quickly

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.110 
on being and now they're lower quickly
just<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.710> show<00:05:20.889> you<00:05:20.949> what<00:05:21.129> it<00:05:21.189> looks<00:05:21.340> like<00:05:21.520> when

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.470 

so<00:05:50.160> I'll<00:05:50.310> take<00:05:50.460> a<00:05:50.520> look<00:05:50.730> at<00:05:50.850> was<00:05:50.970> taken<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.360> the

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
so I'll take a look at was taken to the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.750 
so I'll take a look at was taken to the
gap<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:52.380> two<00:05:52.740> or<00:05:52.800> three<00:05:52.860> steps<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.370> do<00:05:53.669> the

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
gap the two or three steps to do the

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.510 
gap the two or three steps to do the
back<00:05:53.910> in<00:05:54.030> transition<00:05:54.270> done<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.340> feet<00:05:56.340> being

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
parallel shoulder width apart knees bent

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.610 
parallel shoulder width apart knees bent
all<00:06:00.510> your<00:06:00.720> weight<00:06:00.810> version<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.260> dominant

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
all your weight version to the dominant

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.830 
all your weight version to the dominant
legs<00:06:01.770> you<00:06:02.010> allow<00:06:02.220> it<00:06:02.910> to<00:06:02.970> drift<00:06:03.300> slightly

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
legs you allow it to drift slightly

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.020 
legs you allow it to drift slightly
forward<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:04.290> your<00:06:04.770> other<00:06:05.280> leg<00:06:05.490> through<00:06:05.639> my
