you're<00:01:02.100> working<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> backside<00:01:03.059> flip<00:01:03.359> know

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you're working on the backside flip know

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.000 
you're working on the backside flip know
what's<00:01:03.750> interesting<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.350> me<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.799> can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
what's interesting to me is that you can

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.390 
what's interesting to me is that you can
do<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> half<00:01:05.489> cab<00:01:05.820> flip<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.360> no<00:01:06.540> backside<00:01:06.960> flip

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
do a half cab flip but no backside flip

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.810 
do a half cab flip but no backside flip
half<00:01:08.400> cab<00:01:08.790> flip<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.560> essentially<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.890> backside

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
half cab flip is essentially a backside

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.109 
half cab flip is essentially a backside
flip<00:01:12.119> rolling<00:01:12.479> fakie<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
flip rolling fakie is really what it is

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.460 
flip rolling fakie is really what it is
but<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> could<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.570> how<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> backside<00:01:16.290> flip

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
but I could see how the backside flip

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.039 
but I could see how the backside flip
would<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.070> bit<00:01:17.310> harder<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:18.810> one

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
would be a little bit harder that one

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
would be a little bit harder that one
was<00:01:19.259> really<00:01:19.439> close<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.310> let's<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.700> we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
was really close so let's see what we

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
was really close so let's see what we
got<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.780> slow-mo<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.070> your

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
got going on here in slow-mo so your

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.770 
got going on here in slow-mo so your
turn<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.610> head<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.850> shoulders<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.600> looks

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
turn your head and shoulders that looks

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.410 
turn your head and shoulders that looks
pretty<00:01:24.990> good<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.790> actually

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
pretty good but right there actually

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.770 
pretty good but right there actually
your<00:01:27.630> head<00:01:27.900> stopped<00:01:28.909> that's<00:01:29.909> probably<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
your head stopped that's probably the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.230 
your head stopped that's probably the
biggest<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.670> wrong

biggest thing that you have going wrong

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
biggest thing that you have going wrong
for<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.229> need<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> continue<00:01:35.610> turning

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790

guys may very well know I set out that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.619 
guys may very well know I set out that

sequence of lists a list of tricks in
sequence<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.959> better

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
sequence is a better

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.260 
sequence is a better
way<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> say<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.850> given<00:02:15.180> in

skateboarding<00:02:15.870> made<00:02:16.050> simple<00:02:16.530> volume<00:02:16.800> one<00:02:17.190> two

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
skateboarding made simple volume one two

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.030 
skateboarding made simple volume one two
three<00:02:17.610> four<00:02:17.820> five<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.060> six<00:02:18.300> actually<00:02:19.040> and

those<00:02:22.290> previous<00:02:22.770> tricks<00:02:23.010> down<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.610> looks

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
those previous tricks down so it looks

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.430 
those previous tricks down so it looks
like<00:02:23.940> your<00:02:24.210> kick<00:02:24.420> flips<00:02:24.630> are<00:02:24.780> good<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> do

backside<00:02:28.800> 180s<00:02:29.190> are<00:02:29.340> good<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.970> them

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
backside 180s are good and you have them

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.170 
backside 180s are good and you have them
down<00:02:30.480> well<00:02:30.720> as<00:02:30.870> well<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.890> really<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> think

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
with in terms of these is I don't think

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.880 
with in terms of these is I don't think
with<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.760> oh<00:02:36.000> I'm<00:02:36.960> gonna<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.560> put<00:02:37.740> these

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
with like oh I'm gonna have to put these

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.260 
with like oh I'm gonna have to put these

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
two together and it's going to be so

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.840 
two together and it's going to be so
hard<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.900> think<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.740> oh<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.580> already

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
hard I think with oh I can just already

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.520 
hard I think with oh I can just already
do<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> kickflip<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.110> doing<00:02:43.350> back<00:02:43.470> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
shoulders in the air as you're popping

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.449 
shoulders in the air as you're popping
and<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:04.080> land<00:03:04.350> with<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:04.770> feet<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
front of the board and then spin it

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.070 
front of the board and then spin it
around<00:03:08.070> really<00:03:08.459> fast<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.270> total<00:03:09.630> pivot

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
around really fast it's a total pivot

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.020 
around really fast it's a total pivot
you're<00:03:10.530> basically<00:03:11.010> landing<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.610> nose<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
you're basically landing on the nose and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.940 
you're basically landing on the nose and
then<00:03:12.120> just<00:03:12.300> pivoting<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.870> backside<00:03:13.320> 180<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
then just pivoting the backside 180 and

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.670 
then just pivoting the backside 180 and
it's<00:03:14.910> pretty<00:03:15.209> cheater<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:16.110> it's<00:03:16.290> not<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
it's pretty cheater like it's not like a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.400 
it's pretty cheater like it's not like a
regular<00:03:17.040> good<00:03:17.940> backside<00:03:18.630> flip<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.140> wouldn't

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
regular good backside flip you wouldn't

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.949 
regular good backside flip you wouldn't
do<00:03:19.530> your<00:03:19.709> best<00:03:19.950> backside<00:03:20.580> flip<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.090> but

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959

to learn and there's always a step to do
in<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.880> learning<00:03:30.269> process<00:03:30.300> that's<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.320> big

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
in the learning process that's a big

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.290 
in the learning process that's a big
thing<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:32.010> want<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.310> guys<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.640> understand<00:03:33.120> is
