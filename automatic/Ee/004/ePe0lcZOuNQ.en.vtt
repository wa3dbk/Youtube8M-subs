00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
like a high estate it is going to be the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.740 
like a high estate it is going to be the
winner<00:05:34.010> now<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.789> know<00:05:34.880> am<00:05:35.240> i<00:05:35.449> certain

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
winner now you know am i certain

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.469 
winner now you know am i certain
absolutely<00:05:36.080> not<00:05:36.800> but<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.160> do<00:05:37.340> feel<00:05:37.760> like<00:05:38.240> in<00:05:38.449> the

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
absolutely not but I do feel like in the

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.670 
absolutely not but I do feel like in the
end<00:05:38.690> they're<00:05:38.810> going<00:05:38.930> to<00:05:38.990> be<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.260> winner<00:05:39.440> I

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
end they're going to be the winner I

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.189 
end they're going to be the winner I
think<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.370> high<00:05:40.490> state<00:05:40.789> will<00:05:41.000> likely<00:05:41.210> find<00:05:41.690> one

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
think a high state will likely find one

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.439 
think a high state will likely find one
