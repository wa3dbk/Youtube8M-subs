we'll find that all of these are going
to<00:05:46.960> run<00:05:47.229> a<00:05:47.470> lot<00:05:48.040> less<00:05:48.280> expensive<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:49.030> thus<00:05:49.180> be

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
to run a lot less expensive and thus be

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.810 
to run a lot less expensive and thus be
