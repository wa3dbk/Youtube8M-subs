00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.020
 song 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.830
 hi and welcome again i am cs and 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.320
 they bring a trick here on the map of 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.820
 arrays and good for this trick what 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.650
 we will need is going to be the pieces 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.790
 of the jumper pack so what you have 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.470
 what to do is bring all the pieces 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.140
 until here that they went down alone they have 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.310
 put a patch of long ago 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.750
 and well nothing else that you are dragging 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.700
 the two pieces and they just come down 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.700
 automatically as you are watching it 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.520
 we all get off and well we ride now 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.500
 the jumper pack agreed once what 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.050
 you have what I recommend is that you 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.820
 well as love for this trick does 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.769
 lack good weapons like the slider and fica 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.390
 door 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.950
 and good once finished and if you have the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.750
 weapons 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.980
 for the jumper and everything you have 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.200
 what to do is go to this corner of 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.180
 map and place the jumper pack on the 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 next way to look good you have to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.710
 put it like that, hit 2 and look good as 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.750
 he placed it once he put it on what 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.850
 you have to do is simply to knock down 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.100
 for you to push in 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.780
 this may cost you since you have seen 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 that the first one has not come out 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.560
 now the second one leaves me here as 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.270
 I'm caught like I'm lying down and what's 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.640
 you have to do is place just 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.229
 the jumping bread when you have it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.580
 placed what you have to do is that 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.700
 a zombie push you or kill you 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.560
 although he had is going to die is completely 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 I recommend you have to go that this 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.400
 trick is better for one just good one 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 Once we have the bread is now so 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
 we are placed we were lying 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.110
 what we have to do is stay 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.700
 still in front of him so the maximum 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.920
 is inside and what will make us 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.690
 will be up and leave us 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.540
 Here gotten stuck once here if 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.750
 you want to break it to me it does not break 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.430
 I do not know why I'm just breaking alone 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.950
 and good as you are seeing here already 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.510
 they can pass rounds perfectly and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.070
 good nothing else I hope you enjoy it 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.120
