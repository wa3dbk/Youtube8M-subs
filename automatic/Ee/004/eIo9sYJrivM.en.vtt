 that has a ratillo that has I think that 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.920
 two weeks there was a video this was me 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.900

 the letters are the same as the field 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.460
 same that usually come by 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.100
 default well on the phone 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.960
 if you see that it is very different 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.730
 example I'm going to block my phone and in 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.910
 the letters and the work would now be 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.910

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.800
 or the normal one for propagation and in the other 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.800
 do not 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.609

 pepsi is the one that has right now 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.769
 once you already install 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.610

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.510
 we're going to see if we can take 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.950
 giving them 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.950

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.000
 of the wifi network signal 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.680
