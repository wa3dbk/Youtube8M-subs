00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
is the Draco carbon SRS a lot of you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.990 
is the Draco carbon SRS a lot of you
know<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> love<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.220> dragon<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.880> you're

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
but I have to tell you the drink it was

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
but I have to tell you the drink it was
a<00:00:30.090> hundred<00:00:30.510> grams<00:00:30.660> later<00:00:30.929> prepare<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:32.250> top

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
a hundred grams later prepare to top

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.959 
a hundred grams later prepare to top
that<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> Draco<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> course<00:00:34.469> has<00:00:34.969> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
that so the Draco of course has this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
that so the Draco of course has this
here<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> full<00:00:36.510> carbon<00:00:36.780> sole<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.399> opposed<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
here a full carbon sole as opposed to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
know a CD invention and this year we're

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.180 
know a CD invention and this year we're
we're<00:00:52.199> looking<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.530> what's<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
we're looking at what's going on in the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
we're looking at what's going on in the
industry<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.820> far<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.239> pedal<00:00:54.930> systems<00:00:55.320> it's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
industry as far as pedal systems it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.069 
industry as far as pedal systems it's
important<00:00:55.920> people<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.629> spring<00:00:57.899> bar

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
important people in the to spring bar

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.709 
important people in the to spring bar
pedals<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.710> crank<00:00:59.520> brothers<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.359> look

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
pedals like crank brothers like look

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.560 
pedals like crank brothers like look
like<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> course<00:01:01.260> time<00:01:01.680> pioneer<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.460> most<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
like of course time pioneer this most of

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660 
like of course time pioneer this most of
those<00:01:03.690> require<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.250> protective

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
those require some kind of protective

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
those require some kind of protective
plate<00:01:06.090> between<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> shoe<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
plate between the shoe and the and the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.359 
plate between the shoe and the and the
cleat<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.780> year<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.740> plate<00:01:11.159> right

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
cleat and so this year this plate right

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
cleat and so this year this plate right
here<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.880> replaceable<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.140> need<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
here is replaceable so you don't need to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
here is replaceable so you don't need to
add<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> extra<00:01:13.860> weight<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.490> stack<00:01:14.700> height<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
add that extra weight or stack height to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.370 
add that extra weight or stack height to
your<00:01:15.210> shoe

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
your shoe

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.630 
your shoe
this<00:01:16.649> is<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> way<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> industry<00:01:17.399> is<00:01:17.460> going

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this is the way the industry is going

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
this is the way the industry is going
this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.539> so<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.409> just

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this is what we like so you can just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
this is what we like so you can just
replace<00:01:19.829> that<00:01:20.039> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.280> need<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> cracks

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
replace that if you need to if it cracks

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.410 
replace that if you need to if it cracks
so<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:23.130> new<00:01:23.280> soul<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.119> Draco

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
so that's the new soul on the Draco

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.950 
so that's the new soul on the Draco
carbon<00:01:24.750> SRS<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.950> let's<00:01:26.369> look<00:01:26.579> at<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.659> upper

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
carbon SRS now let's look at the upper

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
carbon SRS now let's look at the upper
first<00:01:28.920> thing<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> guys<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> look<00:01:30.299> at

first thing I want you guys to look at

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
first thing I want you guys to look at
is<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.049> CD<00:01:31.350> heal<00:01:31.530> retention<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.039> ice<00:01:32.240> which<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
is the CD heal retention of ice which a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
is the CD heal retention of ice which a
lot<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.380> familiar<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.100> been

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
lot of you are familiar with it's been

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.330 
lot of you are familiar with it's been
around<00:01:35.520> since<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.149> 2006<00:01:36.780> zero<00:01:37.200> Yvonne<00:01:37.979> Basu

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
around since the 2006 zero Yvonne Basu

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
around since the 2006 zero Yvonne Basu
helped<00:01:38.579> invent<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.119> mr.<00:01:39.420> Deano<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.560> what

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
helped invent it with mr. Deano so what

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
helped invent it with mr. Deano so what
this<00:01:40.890> does<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.640> doesn't<00:01:41.850> change<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> fit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this does is it doesn't change the fit

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.830 
this does is it doesn't change the fit
of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> heal<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:44.369> shuts<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.569> door<00:01:45.600> at

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
of the heal it just shuts the door at

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
of the heal it just shuts the door at
the<00:01:45.960> top<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> rock<00:01:47.039> lock<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.429> helmet<00:01:47.819> so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the top like a rock lock on a helmet so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.419 
the top like a rock lock on a helmet so
that<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.479> heel<00:01:48.659> can't<00:01:48.929> pop<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> mean

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
that your heel can't pop out so I mean
