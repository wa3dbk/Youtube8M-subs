honey and I watch your show and so I
know<00:00:16.379> you're<00:00:16.590> probably<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> number<00:00:17.250> one

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
know you're probably the number one

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.179 
know you're probably the number one
honky<00:00:17.730> pump<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.240> through<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.539> deals<00:00:18.750> work

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
honky pump it through the deals work

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.130 
honky pump it through the deals work
I've<00:00:20.189> been<00:00:20.430> studying<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.480> 40<00:00:21.810> years

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I've been studying here for 40 years

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
I've been studying here for 40 years
it's<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.769> taxidermy<00:00:23.490> sculptor<00:00:23.970> from<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
it's a taxidermy sculptor from the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269 
it's a taxidermy sculptor from the
outside<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.990> studying<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> inside

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
outside and studying them on the inside

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.450 
outside and studying them on the inside
so<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.180> did<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.320> developed<00:00:28.859> an<00:00:29.039> archery

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
so what I did is I developed an archery

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.030 
so what I did is I developed an archery
target<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.869> teaches<00:00:31.260> pinpoint<00:00:31.710> accuracy

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
target that teaches pinpoint accuracy

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.470 
target that teaches pinpoint accuracy
where<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> shoot<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> deer<00:00:32.820> from<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> outside

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
where to shoot the deer from the outside

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.080 
where to shoot the deer from the outside
but<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> has<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.800> based<00:00:35.040> upon<00:00:35.430> perfect

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
but it has to be based upon perfect

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.720 
but it has to be based upon perfect
anatomical<00:00:36.899> knowledge

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
anatomical knowledge

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.410 
anatomical knowledge
okay<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:40.980> doing<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.910> I'm

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
okay so what I'm doing here is I'm

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
okay so what I'm doing here is I'm
demonstrating<00:00:42.690> two<00:00:43.290> hunters<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.800> basically

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
demonstrating two hunters that basically

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.450 
demonstrating two hunters that basically
all<00:00:45.270> information<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.649> find<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
all information that I can find all the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.799 
all information that I can find all the
40<00:00:47.760> years<00:00:47.910> I've<00:00:48.090> been<00:00:48.210> doing<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> researcher

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
40 years I've been doing a researcher

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
40 years I've been doing a researcher
deer<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.800> information<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.430> found<00:00:50.640> from

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
deer all the information I found from

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.150 
deer all the information I found from
archery<00:00:51.239> magazines<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.559> through<00:00:52.829> even<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
veterinary community on the anatomy

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.959 
veterinary community on the anatomy
especially<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> lungs<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> white-tailed

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
especially of the lungs of white-tailed

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.049 
especially of the lungs of white-tailed
deer<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.870> spinal<00:00:58.289> column<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.829> wrong<00:00:59.160> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
deer or the spinal column is wrong so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
deer or the spinal column is wrong so

and give many seminars on the anatomy of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
and give many seminars on the anatomy of
a<00:01:28.500> whitetail<00:01:28.680> deer<00:01:28.979> internally<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.700> how<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
a whitetail deer internally of how it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
a whitetail deer internally of how it
relates<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> hunter<00:01:30.840> salt<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.950> because

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
relates to the hunter salt and because

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
relates to the hunter salt and because
there's<00:01:32.759> many<00:01:33.060> many<00:01:33.329> many<00:01:33.600> misconceptions

it in half the rib cage the ribs come
out<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.820> back<00:02:38.000> or<00:02:38.270> they<00:02:38.480> actually<00:02:38.810> go<00:02:38.930> off

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
out the back or they actually go off

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
to see it now watch this here my finger

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.310 
to see it now watch this here my finger
is<00:02:49.130> right<00:02:49.160> here<00:02:49.520> this<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.150> backbone<00:02:50.630> okay

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
is right here this is the backbone okay

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.800 
is right here this is the backbone okay
this<00:02:51.830> rib<00:02:52.100> comes<00:02:52.400> up<00:02:52.550> above<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:52.880> these<00:02:53.510> lungs

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
this rib comes up above that these lungs

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.150 
this rib comes up above that these lungs
are<00:02:54.050> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.230> inflate<00:02:54.560> all<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> way<00:02:55.100> to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
are going to inflate all the way to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.110 
are going to inflate all the way to
there

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.820 

now<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.720> movement<00:03:01.960> people<00:03:02.320> say<00:03:02.590> when<00:03:02.740> the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
now the movement people say when the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.990 
now the movement people say when the
lungs<00:03:03.040> deflate<00:03:03.520> when<00:03:03.670> they're<00:03:03.790> breathing

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
lungs deflate when they're breathing

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.270 
lungs deflate when they're breathing
they<00:03:04.330> go<00:03:04.480> down<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:05.350> movement<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.070> lungs

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
they go down the movement on the lungs

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.700 
they go down the movement on the lungs
are<00:03:06.490> two<00:03:06.670> different<00:03:07.060> places<00:03:07.270> one<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.470> ribs

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
are two different places one is the ribs

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.530 
are two different places one is the ribs
like<00:03:08.920> when<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.160> run<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.850> know<00:03:09.970> your<00:03:10.180> stomach

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
like when you run you know your stomach

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.580 
like when you run you know your stomach
goes<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.020> out<00:03:11.080> with<00:03:11.290> your<00:03:11.320> ribcage

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
goes in and out with your ribcage

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.490 
goes in and out with your ribcage
because<00:03:12.430> they're<00:03:12.700> they're<00:03:13.450> joined<00:03:13.810> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
because they're they're joined it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.570 
because they're they're joined it
actually<00:03:14.770> got<00:03:14.860> joints<00:03:15.220> there<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.430> they<00:03:15.490> have

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
actually got joints there and they have

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.730 
actually got joints there and they have
cartilage<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.270> expand<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.260> other<00:03:17.380> thing<00:03:17.650> is

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
cartilage to expand the other thing is

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.800 
cartilage to expand the other thing is
the<00:03:17.890> diaphragm<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.670> back<00:03:18.850> that's<00:03:19.570> where

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
the diaphragm in the back that's where

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.300 
the diaphragm in the back that's where
the<00:03:19.900> major<00:03:20.080> movement<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.680> goes<00:03:20.950> back<00:03:21.130> and

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
the major movement is that goes back and

didn't go Sunday that one day where he
actually<00:04:05.200> hit<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.560> backbone<00:04:05.980> hit<00:04:06.459> they

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
actually hit the backbone hit they

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.310 
actually hit the backbone hit they
ordered<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.150> pushed<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.600> away<00:04:07.750> from<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.230> back

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
ordered and pushed it away from the back

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.470 
ordered and pushed it away from the back
when<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.590> had<00:04:08.739> two<00:04:08.920> slits<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.400> body<00:04:09.640> the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
when I had two slits of the body the

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.360 
when I had two slits of the body the
gear<00:04:10.720> ran<00:04:10.989> away<00:04:11.140> sight<00:04:11.500> came<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.860> he<00:04:11.920> says<00:04:12.100> a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
gear ran away sight came and he says a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.250 
gear ran away sight came and he says a
shot<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.880> Bucky<00:04:13.030> went<00:04:13.300> 30<00:04:13.510> yards<00:04:13.810> sideways

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
shot of Bucky went 30 yards sideways

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.500 
shot of Bucky went 30 yards sideways
staggering<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.340> he<00:04:15.400> dropped<00:04:15.640> dead<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.480> I

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
staggering and he dropped dead so I

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.759 
staggering and he dropped dead so I
reasoned<00:04:16.959> how<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.109> he<00:04:17.230> going<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.410> go<00:04:17.530> with<00:04:17.650> an

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
reasoned how is he going to go with an

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.830 
reasoned how is he going to go with an
arrow<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.190> only<00:04:18.340> go<00:04:18.430> 30<00:04:18.640> yards<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.450> why<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.690> he

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
arrow and only go 30 yards and why is he

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.810 
arrow and only go 30 yards and why is he
staggered<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:20.980> figured<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.400> hit<00:04:21.549> him<00:04:21.640> high

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
staggered so I figured it hit him high

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.730 
staggered so I figured it hit him high
if<00:04:22.480> we<00:04:22.540> hit<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> back<00:04:22.930> when<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:23.290> like<00:04:23.470> hit<00:04:23.710> a

because of that there reason he died at

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.080 
because of that there reason he died at
30<00:04:29.050> yards<00:04:29.410> is<00:04:29.530> he<00:04:30.040> not<00:04:30.220> only<00:04:30.250> double<00:04:30.730> lung<00:04:30.880> them

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
30 yards is he not only double lung them

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.820 
30 yards is he not only double lung them
but<00:04:31.450> he<00:04:31.510> also<00:04:31.690> had<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.020> major<00:04:32.169> blood<00:04:32.440> vessel

that comes out of the top it was to pull

that comes out of the top it was to pull
back<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.830> because<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.190> gear<00:04:36.370> dies<00:04:36.580> for

back it so because the gear dies for
three<00:04:37.060> different<00:04:37.150> reasons<00:04:37.360> with<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.810> shock<00:04:38.020> to
