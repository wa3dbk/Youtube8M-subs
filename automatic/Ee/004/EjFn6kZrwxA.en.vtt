all got faces some better than others
but<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.130> will<00:01:33.370> find<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:33.700> out<00:01:33.880> loud<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.500> of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
but we will find that out loud and of

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.500 
but we will find that out loud and of
course<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:36.190> also<00:01:36.370> know<00:01:36.730> that<00:01:36.760> there's<00:01:37.150> one

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
course we also know that there's one

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.780 
course we also know that there's one
rather<00:01:38.320> unusual<00:01:39.010> thing<00:01:39.220> that<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.520> simply

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
rather unusual thing that you simply

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.900 
rather unusual thing that you simply
can't<00:01:40.240> stand<00:01:41.280> talking<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:42.790> if<00:01:42.820> we<00:01:44.430> keep<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.670> to

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
can't stand talking so if we keep it to

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.250 
can't stand talking so if we keep it to
a<00:01:45.940> minute<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.360> think<00:01:46.420> that's<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.780> advantage<00:01:46.990> of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
a minute I think that's the advantage of

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.930 
a minute I think that's the advantage of
a<00:01:47.320> blank<00:01:47.620> face<00:01:47.920> there<00:01:48.220> would<00:01:48.370> be<00:01:48.400> no<00:01:48.640> talking

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
a blank face there would be no talking

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.320 
a blank face there would be no talking
but<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.270> do<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.840> prefer<00:01:50.350> faces<00:01:51.160> and<00:01:51.400> then<00:01:51.730> just<00:01:52.120> a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
but I do I prefer faces and then just a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.510 
but I do I prefer faces and then just a
little<00:01:52.600> bit<00:01:52.690> of<00:01:52.810> shush<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.410> Mike<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:54.370> get
