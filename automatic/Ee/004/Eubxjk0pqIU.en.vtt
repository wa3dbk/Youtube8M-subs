00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.109
 that one that takes seven and eight here 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:11.440
 we are again this way 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.180
 inbox for comments you're screaming at me 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.420
 a lot also another issue of what is 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.949
 this to the payment with gona one of the subjects 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.720
 good and within the classics this a 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.569
 Big theme of Mr. AndrÃ© Landeros 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.980
 subject also has included in a 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:30.089
 popular song what is this 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.070
 conviction to the Colombian abbot and troop 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.460
 this one they ask me why not done 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.030
 tutorials well this one little bit that I 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.570
 I know we are going to share it with all of you 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.370
 this 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.059
 let's hope that my way of explaining 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.829
 can understand how to execute 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.449
 that is understandable to all the people who 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.500
 is learning this instrument that is 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.020
 the accordion 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.960
 this kind of intermediaries then I 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.899
 I imagine it will facilitate us more and 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.539
 we have advanced do not say that you are 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.960
 watching this video truth and we what 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.320
 can they take out 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.010
 This let 's get this issue pay with 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 bona 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.320
 so beginners and intermediates 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.109
 You may have done your exercises 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.109
 to some this with this subject pays with desire 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.180
 there is a part afterwards although it comes from the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.360
 letter is done in the same tony the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 D minor tonality on the king scale 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.740
 and this one 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.800
 although this perhaps intermediaries to 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.160
 those who are in the middle the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.830
 launched with this they were more or less followed 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.110
 and you can take out the now let's try 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.730
 to do the tutorial and what and what 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.210
 can understand how the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.210
 song 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.640
 for it faster I'm not going to tell you 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.340
 the buttons the button number 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.220
 in the note to make it more agile nothing 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.300
 more than they have their accordion of sun we go 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.990
 to avoid this this sound we start with 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.990
 this 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.439
 hot 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.799
 and right here inward fire on 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.799
 fan 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.890
 yes outside 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.110
 good 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.420
 the bands go to the escalator towards 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.420
 above 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.380
 every time 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.320
 ep 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.940
 p 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
 mmm 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:23.870
 in the next part from here to the end 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.840
 run 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.880
 this octave 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.400
 Let's see 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:12.170
 a little bit more complete that we continue 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.170
 with what is the end 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.620
 but 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.720
 and you do not 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.180
 they do the same thing that we are doing here 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.180
 up but now down here 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.550
