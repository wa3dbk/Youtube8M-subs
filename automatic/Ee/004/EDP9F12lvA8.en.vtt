00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.910
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.150
 so I'm bringing it to you today 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.280
 a river video in genres that is a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.639
 play a fps 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.119
 it is well in the second war style and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.910
 How can you see the game? 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.519
 no she has that wonderful graphic 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.689
 but the graphics are good 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.820
 to the animations of the game still so little 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.980
 Strange, it's still not all right because 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 The game is in beta and this has already been 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.540
 clarified that O still not perfect or 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.600
 the animations or the sounds but anyway I 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 I played some of the game yesterday and I 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 I really liked the game because it brings 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.430
 war rather than 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.980
 is equal to the field where 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.410
 You go relaxing and you're riding now. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.480
 everything is very different 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 in it I already realized they prioritize more 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.510
 of combat at a distance than combat 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.320
 close the game with envy as already 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.020
 I said and I do not know exactly how you 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 would do to win beta 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 I won it because I think I 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.930
 signed up think unsure me 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.580
 I registered in their beta I received yesterday 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.479
 There were people who had received a long time ago. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.829
 behind 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.740
 but I received yesterday but at last the game 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.810
 also it is no different because he 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 not if you, for example, you do not enter 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.000
 in same game on pf you enter the game 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.909
 of people between the other 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.270
 You have a map as if it were a map. 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.100
 of a country of a world continent 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.740
 finally you have the map and and for that map 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.380
 you have two sides you have the taxis and 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.969
 the salahis and so after the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.549
 game 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.310
 you are either defending or attacking the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.860
 points because because you have 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.150
 map domination 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.730
 so when you come in 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.439
 game that is what the barlogical type browser 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.599
 You will see that you have the map or it is 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:26.650
 red or it if it means that 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:30.250
 has one part or the other 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.250
 dominating but finally you can see there 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.239
 that I was trying to invade this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.040
 point on the bridge that is a good point 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.019
 interesting because you have a vision of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 the back of the city and you have 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.849
 from there you can see how 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.959
 I 'm having a hard time getting a shot. 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.269
 that shot and killed cop killed expensive but 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.549
 Anyway, you see there's another there and the 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.480
 first shot i got it right he picked it on 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:01.629
 area and in another but in the other shot I 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.129
 I got it right and after that I was all 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.230
 Happy I did not even say pon 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.470
 now someone is going to kill I saw the guys already 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.409
 entering the city but the truth is that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.879
 I ended up taking a snipe shot and 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:16.480
 Tomato animation funny because you 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:20.470
 fly away looks is very bizarre but anyway 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.060
 already that part has tank that shot 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.989
 I'm sure I'm sure that's for sure. 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.329
 that he had 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.250
 I do not know if he was dead having that 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.680
 was the tank in my 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.669
 front, but we were trying to 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.319
 hold that part of the house because the 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.109
 People were defending the store was 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.609
 attacking and we had to 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:46.870
 defend the bridge because of the tanks 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:49.209
 so I get through it had 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.889
 many allies trying to pass 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.900
 but the tank killed I got through 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.549
 Luckily I saw that there was a guy behind 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.699
 That's why I left that 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.139
 But now, grenade, you see something. 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.840
 curious 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:04.569
 Can you see that guy in the tank? 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.590
 because he is the one he killed and the tank became 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.930
 neutral 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.269
 I still do not understand if that guy is the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.220
 tank pilot for me 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.599
 apparently from the first list he was 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.620
 the gamer 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:22.719
 but then I analyzed it well and it ended 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.060
 being apparently the pilot of the tank 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:26.950
 I was trying to hit my ally. 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.830
 there for some reason 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.780
 but anyway I do not know if it pleases 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.630
 effect on the tank in this game but I 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.110
 I was testing and there's another one 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.650
 ride the tank and a beautiful duel play 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.140
 but ultimately I ended up there after that 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.880
 getting stuck in the house because of 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.010
 the tank did not work out 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.190
 none and he ended up killing me from a 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.900
 one way or another but I did 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.550
 capture the point for people and the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.460
 tank in this game he looks like 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.450
 interesting though this noise you 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.500
 you see it is very annoying and it is not 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.060
 the final noise is still only the beta already 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.910
 in this part that we trying to 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.980
 franchise that side of our point 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.620
 because we were losing everything here 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.690
 time you can see that it has fallen and an ally 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.180
 and I killed that guy who was in the 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.450
 egypt he was every boy shooting 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.020
 there and had a funny part in that. 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.330
 in this game play you will see that 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.090
 dude there, that guy from the left came 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.000
 running and it's very difficult to accept 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.420
 ClÃ´ surrenders with the m1 and looks at the little man 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.670
 and he came to see in the clear knife that 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.880
 knife will close too, and we 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.390
 tried to stab but could not 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.790
 this here is the other but then he did 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.970
 that in the classic priest who pulls the 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.710
 gun then look at the little buggy that has 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.500
 Sometimes I managed to kill him in that 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.560
 shot but sometimes it has this little baby 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.930
 that I 'm a little timber because he 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.870
 deserved this derby 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.710
 anyway it has sometimes got bugs in the 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.400
 game it has some bugs and the server at 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.740
 Sometimes it starts, but it's fast. 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.260
 and it's not every time it's not clear 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.500
 not all the time that the large game because 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.520
 Finally the game if it is well invested if 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.740
 I'm not mistaken, he 's a company. 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.260
 independent but he was well invested 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.830
 It sure is a game that I'm going to 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.020
 I wanted to play a lot but finally the guys 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.900
 I hope you liked it, it's just 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.770
 that for today and 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.350
 friday maybe maybe i wanted it 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.889
 bring a video here because the year 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:55.720
 playing a lot with her and a lot in the 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:57.880
 I spend a lot of time with her but at least she is me 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.009
 I really enjoy playing with her and 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.430
 I did not play much 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:05.830
 but last Friday probably the 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.979
 bring tomorrow maybe to bring another video 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:12.160
 the second training with br s 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:15.660
 and finally I'll be staying here then 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.660
 people said
