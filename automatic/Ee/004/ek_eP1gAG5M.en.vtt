00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
this whole easter egg is about is is all

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.570 
this whole easter egg is about is is all
about<00:00:15.780> trying<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.260> Samantha<00:00:16.710> from<00:00:17.130> this

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
about trying to be Samantha from this

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550 
about trying to be Samantha from this
realm<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.119> if<00:00:18.270> she<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> trapped<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.170> she

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
realm that if she is trapped in and she

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.950 
realm that if she is trapped in and she
specifically<00:00:20.070> tells<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.750> for<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> first

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
specifically tells you for the first

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960 
specifically tells you for the first
step<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.560> build<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:23.010> four<00:00:23.279> elemental<00:00:23.760> staffs

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
step to build all four elemental staffs

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.210 
step to build all four elemental staffs
and<00:00:24.330> I'll<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.109> breaking<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.619> step<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:26.039> into

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
and I'll be breaking this step up into

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
and I'll be breaking this step up into
five<00:00:26.400> parts<00:00:26.609> because<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> long<00:00:27.740> it's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
five parts because this is a long it's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.630 
five parts because this is a long it's
really<00:00:29.039> long<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:30.840> takes<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.140> while<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.520> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
really long it takes a while to so it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.090 
really long it takes a while to so it
just<00:00:32.759> takes<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.149> long<00:00:33.270> time<00:00:33.300> um<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.770> anyways

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
just takes a long time um but in anyways

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.170 
just takes a long time um but in anyways
the<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.930> apart<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.559> solve<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.190> step<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the first apart to solve this step is to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
the first apart to solve this step is to
find<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.079> two<00:00:40.230> musical<00:00:40.739> parts<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
find the two musical parts the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.150 
find the two musical parts the
gramophone<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.899> vinyl<00:00:43.230> record<00:00:43.530> cv<00:00:43.920> what

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
gramophone and the vinyl record cv what

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
gramophone and the vinyl record cv what
everyone<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.360> need<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
everyone and do that you need to go to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
everyone and do that you need to go to
the<00:00:46.170> excavation<00:00:47.070> side<00:00:47.250> costs<00:00:47.700> twenty-five

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the excavation side costs twenty-five

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.619 
the excavation side costs twenty-five
hundred<00:00:48.440> right<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.559> um<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.969> downstairs

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
hundred right up here um go downstairs

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.400 
hundred right up here um go downstairs
and<00:00:52.370> usually<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> find<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.050> right

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and usually you know I find it right

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.610 
and usually you know I find it right
there<00:00:55.739> pretty<00:00:56.100> much<00:00:56.190> every<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.820> um<00:00:57.690> you'll

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
there pretty much every time um you'll

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
there pretty much every time um you'll
find<00:00:59.280> both<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.030> parts<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:01.469> here<00:01:02.010> though<00:01:02.670> in

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
find both the parts on in here though in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.380 
find both the parts on in here though in
the<00:01:03.690> excavation<00:01:04.650> side<00:01:04.939> unfortunately<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.210> ask

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the excavation side unfortunately we ask

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.800 
the excavation side unfortunately we ask
I<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.930> footage<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.439> me<00:01:07.590> find<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.429 
find it but anyways um you will find
both<00:01:22.170> parts<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> excavation<00:01:23.520> site<00:01:23.670> though

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
both parts in the excavation site though

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.510 
both parts in the excavation site though
usually<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.710> hard<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> find<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
usually the hard one to find is the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
usually the hard one to find is the
phenyl<00:01:26.759> record<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.210> define<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.020> under

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
phenyl record you define it to under

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
phenyl record you define it to under
here<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.189> find<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.820> find<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> up

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
here you will find it you can find it up

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590 
here you will find it you can find it up
on<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:31.200> above<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.729> find<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> around<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
on up above you can find it around the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.679 
on up above you can find it around the
excavation<00:01:34.229> site<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.130> it'll<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:36.210> or

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
excavation site but it'll be in or

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.410 
excavation site but it'll be in or
around<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.290> veg<00:01:37.530> side<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> promise<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.060> anyways

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
around as veg side I promise so anyways

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
around as veg side I promise so anyways
so<00:01:40.079> when<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.350> got<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.950> place<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
so when you got it just place the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.490 
so when you got it just place the
gramophone<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.409> have

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
gramophone on there you have to have

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.930 
gramophone on there you have to have
both<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.370 

just<00:01:47.940> letting<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.390> Samantha<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
just letting you here Samantha when you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.320 
just letting you here Samantha when you
do<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.100> stairway<00:01:50.400> opens<00:01:50.910> up<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
do that this stairway opens up and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.440 
do that this stairway opens up and
basically<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.710> stairway<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:54.120> go<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
basically the stairway you go all the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.390 
basically the stairway you go all the
way<00:01:54.480> down<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:56.010> where<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.250> can

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
way down there to get to where you can

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.060 
way down there to get to where you can
build<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:57.060> four<00:01:57.570> element<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.080> staff's<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.950> we

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
build all four element of staff's so we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
build all four element of staff's so we
are<00:01:59.190> done<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.370> grab<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.090> gramophone<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
are done just grab the gramophone and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.250 
are done just grab the gramophone and
that's<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:02.370> found<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.670> first<00:02:02.880> step<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:03.810> if

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
that's it you found the first step so if

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.200 
that's it you found the first step so if
you<00:02:04.440> like<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.950> video<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.910> want<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you like this in video and you want to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.580
