school GoBot Transformer toys to him and
he<00:00:33.590> really<00:00:33.860> enjoys<00:00:34.070> playing<00:00:34.250> with<00:00:34.430> it<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:35.390> the

he really enjoys playing with it but the
transformation<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.800> just<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:37.220> little<00:00:37.790> bit<00:00:38.000> too

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
transformation is just a little bit too

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.810 
transformation is just a little bit too
complicated<00:00:38.570> for<00:00:39.050> him<00:00:39.350> at<00:00:40.280> two<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.730> half

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
complicated for him at two and a half

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.959 
complicated for him at two and a half
years<00:00:41.030> old<00:00:41.230> um<00:00:42.230> he<00:00:42.469> gets<00:00:42.649> most<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:43.130> it<00:00:43.250> but

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
years old um he gets most of it but

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.520 
years old um he gets most of it but
there's<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.270> few<00:00:44.870> parts<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
there's a few parts of the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.960 
there's a few parts of the
transformation<00:00:46.250> he<00:00:46.430> hasn't<00:00:46.670> quite<00:00:46.760> figured

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
transformation he hasn't quite figured

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.020 
transformation he hasn't quite figured
out<00:00:47.180> yet<00:00:47.380> so<00:00:48.380> when<00:00:48.590> I<00:00:48.650> saw<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.130> and<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:49.790> saw

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
out yet so when I saw this and I saw

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.030 
out yet so when I saw this and I saw
that<00:00:50.270> head<00:00:50.570> look<00:00:51.350> there<00:00:51.500> on<00:00:51.560> the<00:00:51.620> packaging

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
that head look there on the packaging

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040 
that head look there on the packaging
one<00:00:52.340> easy<00:00:52.640> step<00:00:52.820> for<00:00:53.210> transformation<00:00:53.870> I

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
one easy step for transformation I

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.440 
one easy step for transformation I
thought<00:00:55.010> hey<00:00:55.160> maybe<00:00:55.850> I'll<00:00:56.000> be<00:00:56.060> able<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.210> figure

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
thought hey maybe I'll be able to figure

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.270 
thought hey maybe I'll be able to figure
us<00:00:56.480> out<00:00:56.570> no<00:00:56.750> problem<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.350> I<00:00:57.560> went<00:00:57.980> ahead<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:58.160> I

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
us out no problem so I went ahead and I

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.780 
us out no problem so I went ahead and I
picked<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.579> up<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.090> this<00:00:59.329> one<00:00:59.480> here<00:00:59.660> is<00:00:59.690> his

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.390 
picked it up and this one here is his
and<00:01:01.790> just<00:01:02.150> because<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:03.079> couldn't<00:01:03.890> be<00:01:03.980> outdone

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
and just because I couldn't be outdone

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.179 
and just because I couldn't be outdone
by<00:01:04.460> having<00:01:04.990> him<00:01:05.990> have<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.320> toy<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.650> not<00:01:06.680> me<00:01:06.950> I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.060 
actually a little stubby smokestacks
like<00:01:59.150> we<00:01:59.299> got<00:01:59.450> on<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.930> g1<00:02:00.290> reissue<00:02:00.740> Optimus

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
like we got on the g1 reissue Optimus

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.160 
like we got on the g1 reissue Optimus
Prime<00:02:01.280> these<00:02:01.970> actually<00:02:02.450> look<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.780> little<00:02:02.900> bit

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
Prime these actually look a little bit

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.710 
Prime these actually look a little bit
like<00:02:03.350> smoke<00:02:03.920> stacks<00:02:04.159> here<00:02:04.400> so<00:02:04.700> they<00:02:05.479> must<00:02:05.689> have

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
like smoke stacks here so they must have

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.160 
like smoke stacks here so they must have
definitely<00:02:05.930> have<00:02:06.260> passed<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.770> drop<00:02:07.220> test<00:02:07.430> so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
definitely have passed the drop test so

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.600 
definitely have passed the drop test so
you<00:02:09.170> look<00:02:09.319> at<00:02:09.439> the<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.920> front<00:02:10.189> here<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.549> a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
you look at the the front here it's a

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.710 
you look at the the front here it's a
little<00:02:10.700> bit<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> closer<00:02:11.209> look<00:02:11.330> here<00:02:11.569> at<00:02:11.629> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
little bit of a closer look here at the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.440 
little bit of a closer look here at the
front<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.560> you've<00:02:12.680> got<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.950> windows<00:02:13.450> you've

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
front so you've got the windows you've

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.390 
front so you've got the windows you've
got<00:02:14.540> an<00:02:14.659> Autobot<00:02:14.959> symbol<00:02:15.319> up<00:02:15.470> here<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.890> top

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
got an Autobot symbol up here in the top

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.390 
got an Autobot symbol up here in the top
center<00:02:16.730> got<00:02:17.480> your<00:02:17.659> grille<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.220> then<00:02:19.220> we<00:02:19.280> got

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
center got your grille and then we got

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.339 
center got your grille and then we got
some<00:02:19.430> yellow<00:02:19.670> down<00:02:19.939> here<00:02:20.150> for<00:02:20.419> the<00:02:20.659> lights<00:02:21.200> in

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
some yellow down here for the lights in

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.970 
some yellow down here for the lights in
the<00:02:21.439> front<00:02:22.779> so<00:02:23.779> as<00:02:24.439> I<00:02:24.529> showed<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.739> on<00:02:24.889> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
the front so as I showed you on the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.900 
the front so as I showed you on the
packaging<00:02:25.400> is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
packaging is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.580 
packaging is
it's<00:02:26.120> one<00:02:26.450> quick<00:02:26.840> easy<00:02:27.050> step<00:02:27.410> for

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
it's one quick easy step for

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.960 
it's one quick easy step for
transformation<00:02:28.220> well<00:02:28.580> how<00:02:28.700> do<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.850> do<00:02:28.940> it

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
transformation well how do you do it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
transformation well how do you do it
well<00:02:29.690> if<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.840> flip<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> toy<00:02:30.350> up<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.710> this

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
well if you flip the toy up like this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.760 
well if you flip the toy up like this
and<00:02:31.390> if<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.450> grab<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.930> cab<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:33.380> on<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> top

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
and if I grab the cab here on the top

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.880 
and if I grab the cab here on the top
and<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.070> flip<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.550> forward<00:02:35.410> you'll<00:02:36.410> see<00:02:36.680> that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
and just flip it forward you'll see that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.280 
and just flip it forward you'll see that
the<00:02:37.040> toy<00:02:37.220> instantly<00:02:37.820> transforms<00:02:38.450> here<00:02:38.780> into

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the toy instantly transforms here into

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.210 
the toy instantly transforms here into
robot<00:02:39.770> mode

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
robot mode

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.130 
robot mode
now<00:02:40.880> technically<00:02:41.360> speaking<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
now technically speaking the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.190 
now technically speaking the
transformation<00:02:43.000> has<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> few<00:02:44.510> steps<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.170> that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
transformation has a few steps so that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.080 
transformation has a few steps so that
was<00:02:45.470> step<00:02:45.740> one<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.280> flipping<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.700> up<00:02:46.910> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
was step one so flipping this up and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.730 
was step one so flipping this up and
having<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> arms<00:02:47.750> pulled<00:02:48.080> out<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.530> legs

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
having the arms pulled out and the legs

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.040 
having the arms pulled out and the legs
pulled<00:02:48.950> apart<00:02:49.190> with<00:02:49.640> step<00:02:49.880> one<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.660> actually

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
pulled apart with step one is actually

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.560 
pulled apart with step one is actually
another<00:02:51.230> smaller<00:02:51.680> step<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:53.390> then<00:02:53.480> we

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
another smaller step here and then we

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.520 
another smaller step here and then we
have<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.750> actually<00:02:54.080> flip<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.680> feet<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:56.530> so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
have to actually flip the feet up so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.160 
have to actually flip the feet up so
it's<00:02:57.740> really<00:02:58.010> technically<00:02:58.730> two<00:02:59.330> steps<00:02:59.660> or<00:02:59.990> if

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
it's really technically two steps or if

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.230 
it's really technically two steps or if
you<00:03:00.260> count<00:03:00.470> each<00:03:00.590> one<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.950> these<00:03:01.040> as<00:03:01.490> one<00:03:01.730> three

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
you count each one of these as one three

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.720 
you count each one of these as one three
steps<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:03.470> it's<00:03:03.620> still<00:03:03.800> an<00:03:04.040> extremely<00:03:04.520> simple

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
steps but it's still an extremely simple

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.600 
steps but it's still an extremely simple
transformation<00:03:05.740> so<00:03:06.740> here's<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.100> figure<00:03:07.310> here

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
transformation so here's the figure here

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.030 
transformation so here's the figure here
and<00:03:07.760> robot<00:03:08.180> mode<00:03:08.360> go<00:03:09.230> ahead<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.590> spin<00:03:09.920> them

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
and robot mode go ahead and spin them

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.030 
and robot mode go ahead and spin them
around<00:03:10.070> here<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:10.610> can<00:03:10.760> see<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.780> back<00:03:15.040> as

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
around here so you can see the back as

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.800 
around here so you can see the back as
you<00:03:16.130> can<00:03:16.280> see<00:03:16.520> it's<00:03:16.790> clearly<00:03:17.240> an<00:03:17.450> optimus

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
you can see it's clearly an optimus

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.740 
you can see it's clearly an optimus
prime<00:03:18.050> figure<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.730> mean<00:03:19.730> again<00:03:20.210> we<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:20.540> our

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
prime figure I mean again we have our

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.920 
prime figure I mean again we have our
typical<00:03:21.350> red<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.800> blue<00:03:22.240> and<00:03:23.240> robot<00:03:23.510> mode<00:03:23.660> here

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
typical red and blue and robot mode here

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.290 
typical red and blue and robot mode here
if<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:24.950> look<00:03:25.130> at<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.340> face<00:03:25.550> on<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:25.850> thing

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
if you look at the face on this thing

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.690 
if you look at the face on this thing
he's<00:03:26.840> actually<00:03:27.020> got<00:03:27.290> yellow<00:03:27.590> painted<00:03:27.950> eyes<00:03:28.100> so

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
he's actually got yellow painted eyes so

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.230 
he's actually got yellow painted eyes so
again<00:03:28.940> very<00:03:28.970> g1<00:03:29.750> toy<00:03:30.290> esque<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:34.240> there's

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
again very g1 toy esque and there's

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.000 
again very g1 toy esque and there's
really<00:03:35.420> no<00:03:35.630> articulation<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.560> speak<00:03:36.860> of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
really no articulation to speak of

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.949 
really no articulation to speak of
whatsoever<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.730> this<00:03:37.880> thing<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.300> mean<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.840> can

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
whatsoever on this thing I mean you can

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.480 
whatsoever on this thing I mean you can
move<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.320> arms<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.800> as<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.040> can<00:03:40.160> see<00:03:40.310> there

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
move the arms in as you can see there

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.740 
move the arms in as you can see there
but<00:03:40.730> that's<00:03:40.910> really<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.209> part<00:03:41.570> of<00:03:41.660> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
but that's really just part of the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.949 
but that's really just part of the
transformation<00:03:42.170> process<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:44.150> only<00:03:44.390> sort<00:03:44.930> of

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
transformation process the only sort of

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.600 
transformation process the only sort of
articulation<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.740> really<00:03:45.920> have<00:03:46.100> are<00:03:46.459> the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
articulation you really have are the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.020 
articulation you really have are the
feet<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.180> again<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.540> can<00:03:47.690> bend<00:03:47.959> those<00:03:49.030> but

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
feet and again you can bend those but

it's<00:04:14.780> very<00:04:15.140> g1<00:04:15.410> esque<00:04:15.910> but<00:04:16.910> then<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:17.180> also

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
it's very g1 esque but then it's also

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.610

loves the g1 toy line from a collector
standpoint<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.539> think<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.289> figure<00:04:48.620> is

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770

outstanding if you're a collector
especially<00:04:52.759> an<00:04:52.819> Optimus<00:04:53.150> Prime<00:04:53.389> collector

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
especially an Optimus Prime collector

especially an Optimus Prime collector

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
it's a really really nice figure

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.679 
it's a really really nice figure

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.499 
it actually makes for a really good
display<00:05:00.020> piece<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:01.340> like<00:05:01.909> I<00:05:02.029> said<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.180> can<00:05:02.330> spin

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509

it around here so you can see the back

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.059 
it around here so you can see the back
again<00:05:04.909> a<00:05:05.090> really<00:05:05.360> good<00:05:05.539> display<00:05:05.810> piece<00:05:06.110> Wow

again a really good display piece Wow
the<00:05:07.129> price<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.639> this<00:05:07.759> is<00:05:07.990> $12.99<00:05:08.990> it<00:05:09.319> seems

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
the price on this is $12.99 it seems

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.469 
the price on this is $12.99 it seems
like<00:05:09.830> it's<00:05:09.979> a<00:05:10.069> little<00:05:10.490> steep<00:05:10.759> in<00:05:10.969> my<00:05:11.060> opinion

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
like it's a little steep in my opinion

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.010 
like it's a little steep in my opinion
especially<00:05:12.379> for<00:05:12.949> what<00:05:13.069> it<00:05:13.189> is<00:05:13.719> now<00:05:14.719> the<00:05:14.779> figure

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
especially for what it is now the figure

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.200 
especially for what it is now the figure
is<00:05:15.139> a<00:05:15.169> little<00:05:15.319> big<00:05:15.919> as<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.669> can<00:05:16.699> see<00:05:16.999> I<00:05:17.029> don't

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
is a little big as you can see I don't

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.269 
is a little big as you can see I don't
have<00:05:17.629> anything<00:05:18.050> here<00:05:18.259> for<00:05:18.710> size<00:05:19.550> comparison

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
have anything here for size comparison

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.529 
have anything here for size comparison
but<00:05:22.279> yeah<00:05:22.460> but<00:05:22.729> say<00:05:22.849> it's<00:05:23.029> definitely<00:05:23.389> bigger

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
but yeah but say it's definitely bigger

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.360 
but yeah but say it's definitely bigger
than<00:05:23.629> a<00:05:24.020> regular<00:05:24.680> deluxe<00:05:25.339> toy<00:05:26.199> but<00:05:27.199> it's

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
than a regular deluxe toy but it's

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.749 
than a regular deluxe toy but it's
extremely<00:05:28.370> simple

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
extremely simple

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.719 
extremely simple
so<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.930> $12.99<00:05:30.499> price<00:05:30.740> point<00:05:31.099> seems<00:05:31.339> a<00:05:31.460> little

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
so the $12.99 price point seems a little

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.540 
so the $12.99 price point seems a little
high<00:05:32.029> on<00:05:32.060> this<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.659> would<00:05:33.229> think<00:05:33.409> $9.99<00:05:34.279> would

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
high on this I would think $9.99 would

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.839 
high on this I would think $9.99 would
make<00:05:34.699> more<00:05:34.909> sense<00:05:36.219> but<00:05:37.219> there<00:05:37.430> you<00:05:37.520> have<00:05:37.550> it

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
make more sense but there you have it

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.469 
make more sense but there you have it
they<00:05:38.210> are<00:05:38.300> $12.99<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.789> again<00:05:40.999> I<00:05:41.029> bought<00:05:41.330> this

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
they are $12.99 and again I bought this

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.659 
they are $12.99 and again I bought this
from<00:05:41.659> my<00:05:41.839> nephew<00:05:42.099> but<00:05:43.099> I<00:05:43.159> liked<00:05:43.370> it<00:05:43.490> so<00:05:43.610> much

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
from my nephew but I liked it so much

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.519
