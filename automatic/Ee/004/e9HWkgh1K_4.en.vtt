all<00:03:25.670> right<00:03:25.819> Amy<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.080> tech<00:03:27.290> angle

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
all right Amy you have the tech angle

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.229 
all right Amy you have the tech angle
for<00:03:27.800> a<00:03:27.830> day<00:03:28.069> what<00:03:28.400> do<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.549> think<00:03:28.730> about<00:03:28.819> it

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
for a day what do you think about it

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.630 
for a day what do you think about it
it's<00:03:29.870> really<00:03:30.080> nice<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.620> like<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.920> way<00:03:31.010> feels<00:03:31.400> my

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
it's really nice I like the way feels my

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.600 
it's really nice I like the way feels my
hand<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.450> took<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.720> lot<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.049> guesswork<00:03:33.379> out

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
hand it took a lot of the guesswork out

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.800 
hand it took a lot of the guesswork out
the<00:03:34.610> teper<00:03:35.030> real<00:03:35.209> fine

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
the teper real fine

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.979 
the teper real fine
better<00:03:36.470> than<00:03:36.680> my<00:03:36.799> man<00:03:37.040> :<00:03:37.430> also<00:03:38.390> my<00:03:38.540> Mackall<00:03:38.930> is

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
better than my man : also my Mackall is

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:39.910 
better than my man : also my Mackall is
not<00:03:39.110> reversible

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
not reversible

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.369 
not reversible
oh<00:03:39.950> yeah<00:03:40.700> it's<00:03:40.879> just<00:03:41.060> one<00:03:41.209> way<00:03:41.390> so<00:03:41.959> that's<00:03:42.080> kind

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
oh yeah it's just one way so that's kind

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.119 
oh yeah it's just one way so that's kind
of<00:03:42.410> cool<00:03:42.470> too<00:03:42.799> so<00:03:43.180> end<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.420> day<00:03:44.890> which<00:03:45.890> one

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
of cool too so end of the day which one
