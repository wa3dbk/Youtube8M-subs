 by the way this collection that is called that digital type 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.189
 it was an idea that arose as a result of the exhibition

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.170
 Cerdá as it is currently true is committed digitally and that is why we have 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.250

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.640
 some a yellow kinetic defect which does not exist but is there 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.000
 I suffer a lot with an Italian model 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.329

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.030
 electro digital 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.769
 in electromagnetism age 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.380
 they were 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.000
 an inventor and it will show 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.440
 on traditional cement but although it sounds like electronic music 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.659
 why do you see the taxes usually have a sound of the group 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.069
 he also touched sanctions I did one of the voices the delicate 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.209

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.019
 language us as musicians monte raped 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.719
 opportunity to develop 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.939
 on the one hand 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.759
 man is his organic part his existence 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.009
 what he does not know himself 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.009
 On the other hand, he clarified that the inventory of 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.459
 for us electronic music 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.459
 opens many doors entered the possibility of carrying a message 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:17.649
 by the fact that it was close to perfection 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.749
 within that perfection we as an organic entity 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.289
 we have the capabilities of 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.299
 take a path forward but understanding that we are human 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.929
 and do it that is something understandable to our minds 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.559
 definitely 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.809
 connecting the arts is part of our philosophy 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.319
 connecting the opposites is our philosophy and for a long time it has 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.429
 felt the music the art end 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.189
 i fashion 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.959
 in certain separate places this is a moment plan to connect all of them and 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.229
 we are very proud to be a vehicle 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.660
 to find that 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.450
 that connection to achieve that synergy between what is nothing male fashion 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.669
 the art more 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.789
 Elaborated 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.049
 and the most conceptual music more 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.049
 I thought yes 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.909
 It has been a very hard experience, it has left a great surprise because you are 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.229
 little state 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.669
 I have always had a lot 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.039
 the care of northern Baghdad the creator certain things 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.659
 because art has 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.879
 nor specified in particular 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.879
 but it gives me a lot of pleasure that he has done it with exquisite taste 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.500
 there is no doubt everything is elegance that great joy 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.370
 we designed made it obvious 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.930
 he is very creative 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.690
 and the other one that has known to take advantage of the proposals in the text 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.509
 johnson 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.849
 why color palmero 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.949
 without even giving information provided by the defense or Spanish 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.990
 such as its original shape thing that 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.159
 quite difficult
