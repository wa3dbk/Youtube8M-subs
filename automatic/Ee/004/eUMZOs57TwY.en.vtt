00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and but that stop mode done and I made a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.130 
and but that stop mode done and I made a
wee<00:01:15.900> plate<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.619> screwed<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> that's

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
wee plate and screwed it on so that's

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.460 
wee plate and screwed it on so that's
finished<00:01:19.680> only<00:01:20.430> heed<00:01:21.330> taking<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> beatings<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
finished only heed taking the beatings I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.160 
finished only heed taking the beatings I
just<00:01:22.890> take<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.189> off<00:01:23.490> push<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> beatings<00:01:24.750> out

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
just take this off push the beatings out

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.450 
just take this off push the beatings out
I've<00:01:26.130> also<00:01:26.310> pegged<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.110> beatings<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
I've also pegged that beatings and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
I've also pegged that beatings and
there's<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.840> modification<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> same

now<00:02:46.400> that's<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.609> next<00:02:47.760> job<00:02:48.739> then<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.890> plane

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
now that's the next job then the plane

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.360 
now that's the next job then the plane
release<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.910> clutch<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.390> all<00:02:51.599> done<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.370> did

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
release a the clutch is all done I did

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.940

away<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.819> bond<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:55.200> Birman<00:02:55.620> clutch

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
away with a bond on the Birman clutch

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.220 
away with a bond on the Birman clutch
because<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.459> had<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.849> weld<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:57.329> all<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.750> indents

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because I had to weld up all the indents

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.630 
because I had to weld up all the indents
and<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> basket

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
I don't need the van Dyle I don't need

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.330 
I don't need the van Dyle I don't need
that<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.420> makes<00:03:03.720> easier<00:03:04.049> work<00:03:04.650> I've<00:03:04.890> ever<00:03:05.010> have

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that it makes easier work I've ever have

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.240 
that it makes easier work I've ever have
to<00:03:05.489> fix<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.970> indents<00:03:06.359> again<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:08.430> 37th<00:03:09.269> ream

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
to fix the indents again the 37th ream

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.380 
to fix the indents again the 37th ream
didn't<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:12.510> foot<00:03:12.720> brake<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.379> mountain<00:03:14.390> it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
didn't have the foot brake a mountain it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.870 
didn't have the foot brake a mountain it
was<00:03:15.629> an<00:03:15.840> attention<00:03:16.170> case<00:03:16.829> on<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.220> model<00:03:17.459> so

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
was an attention case on that model so

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.589 
was an attention case on that model so
I've<00:03:18.560> had<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.889> like<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> EJ<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.819> score<00:03:21.419> below

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
I've had to like the EJ a score below

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.780 
I've had to like the EJ a score below
the<00:03:22.049> barbary<00:03:22.590> arrangement<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.519> what<00:03:23.669> I'm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the barbary arrangement so what I'm

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.440 
the barbary arrangement so what I'm
gonna<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.829> have<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:25.859> off<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.430> road

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
gonna do is have it off this road

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.430 
gonna do is have it off this road
I'm<00:03:27.660> gonna<00:03:27.900> make<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.260> longer<00:03:28.500> push<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.440> brake

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
I'm gonna make it longer push the brake

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.509 
I'm gonna make it longer push the brake
so<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.190> operates<00:03:32.760> separately<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:34.519> I'll

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
so that it operates separately and I'll

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.809 
so that it operates separately and I'll
make<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> stop<00:03:36.329> well<00:03:37.200> I've<00:03:37.319> started<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.489> down

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
make a stop well I've started it's down

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.750 
make a stop well I've started it's down
there<00:03:39.030> I'll<00:03:39.329> make<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.989> stop<00:03:40.379> so<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.400> pedal

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
there I'll make a stop so that the pedal

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.890 
there I'll make a stop so that the pedal
has<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.540> stalk<00:03:43.699> I've<00:03:44.699> made<00:03:44.970> folding<00:03:45.419> foot<00:03:45.660> race

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
has a stalk I've made folding foot race

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.809 
has a stalk I've made folding foot race
for<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.980> I'll<00:03:47.129> cut<00:03:47.400> them<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> bit<00:03:47.879> shorter

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
for it and I'll cut them a bit shorter

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.689 
for it and I'll cut them a bit shorter
the<00:03:50.819> chain<00:03:51.120> guard<00:03:51.389> I've<00:03:51.690> still<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.669> modify<00:03:53.669> a

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
the chain guard I've still to modify a

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.509 
the chain guard I've still to modify a
fit<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:56.359> basically<00:03:57.359> it's<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:58.349> coming<00:03:59.220> out<00:03:59.340> it

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
fit and basically it's all coming out it

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.970 
fit and basically it's all coming out it
now<00:03:59.780> just<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.900> case<00:04:01.109> of<00:04:01.139> building<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.620> engine

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
now just a case of building the engine

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.000 
now just a case of building the engine
now<00:04:02.129> and<00:04:02.250> getting<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.549> back<00:04:02.760> in
