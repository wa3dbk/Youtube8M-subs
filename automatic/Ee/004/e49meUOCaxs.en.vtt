00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.840
 hello youtube friends how are you and 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.020
 well here I bring you a new video 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.020
 tutorial 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.170
 and good the video tutorial of today treats 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.289
 to solve a problem that our 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.780
 windows brings 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.700
 of effect and good with that good problem 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.170
 if we go to team we can 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.320
 see that on our local disk we have 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.570
 for example because in my case I have 211 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.790
 gigabytes available 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.690
 and suppose that suddenly it does not 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.600
 we open a folder we suddenly enter 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.750
 what our browser and not you 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.580
 we make download a lot of things 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.610
 and we see that little is being spent on 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.210
 bit memory without 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 and download anything 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.120
 and many think it 's a virus to me 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.510
 happened then we resorted to what is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.510
 our 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.290
 I do not know about our antivirus and we analyze 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 our team and it does not detect anything 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.880
 and good first of all, to say that 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.380
 it's not virus so they do not go to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.310
 worry more and good the problem is that 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.540
 windows occupies a certain capacity of your 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.490
 memory for 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.840
 a disk protection of your system to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.370
 fix that we're going to go to team 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.370
 Right click and properties 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.150
 let's wait for him to open us and we 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.150
 let's go to system protection 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.509
 good I tell you windows occupy this 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.150
 as I have been saying to you as once 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.870
 protection of our system although not 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.450
 be that 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.760
 because really because that does not protect us 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.200
 nothing in what makes us not that we 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.780
 It protects our system because it really 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.750
 is our good antivirus that we 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.030
 will open a window as it is here 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.200
 this will disappear and you will 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.209
 will appear here activated 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.239
 they are going to mark it they are going to select it with 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.920
 Click and you will go to set up and 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.540
 you will see one of these not 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.640
 I remember well what it was but you 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.890
 they will put disable protection of 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.210
 system and they will give you to apply and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.580
 accept and then accept 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.510
 and immediately you are going to go to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.410
 what the team is and they may notice that 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.570
 certain memory that for example if already 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 they had busy around here he was returned a 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.000
 13 it may be that something of your memory and already 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.060
 So you have more capacity because 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.190
 we are removing the ones that I think that 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.380
 are 10 gigabytes that occupied windows 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.240
 for your protection 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.960
 and good friends this video tutorial is 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.960
 something short 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.390
