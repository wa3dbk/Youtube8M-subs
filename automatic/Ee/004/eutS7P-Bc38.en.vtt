00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
camera and a computer so in case fit

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
camera and a computer so in case fit
into<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:15.119> life<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.350> just

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
into my life in that way I just

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
into my life in that way I just
remembered<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.670> coming<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.830> synchronized

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
remembered it coming so synchronized

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.120 
remembered it coming so synchronized
with<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.240> Apple<00:01:21.720> Computer<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.830> thought

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
with the Apple Computer and I thought

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
with the Apple Computer and I thought
that's<00:01:23.400> very<00:01:23.580> unique<00:01:24.000> because<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.869> hadn't<00:01:25.320> seen

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that's very unique because I hadn't seen

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.609 
that's very unique because I hadn't seen
a<00:01:25.830> parent<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:27.030> remember<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:28.229> felt

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
a parent that I could remember that felt

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
a parent that I could remember that felt
so<00:01:29.070> obvious<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.750> oh<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.110> you're

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so obvious it was like oh if you're

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
so obvious it was like oh if you're
gonna<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.920> Apple<00:01:32.159> computer<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.820> you're

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
gonna have an Apple computer and you're

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.850 
gonna have an Apple computer and you're
gonna<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> backpack<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.560> you're<00:01:34.710> gonna
