00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
back in there now there's a good tip for

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.280 
back in there now there's a good tip for
you<00:03:31.520> always<00:03:31.760> use<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.940> pen<00:03:32.240> that<00:03:32.270> hold<00:03:33.020> whatever

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
you always use a pen that hold whatever

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:52.880 
you always use a pen that hold whatever
it<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:33.620> you're<00:03:33.800> cooking<00:03:34.660> not<00:03:35.660> like<00:03:35.870> me

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.370 

no<00:03:53.520> ice<00:03:55.610> some<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.760> mushrooms<00:03:57.240> up<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.630> top

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.600 

that's<00:04:01.380> why<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.680> chicken<00:04:02.100> wasn't<00:04:02.280> cooked

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
that's why the chicken wasn't cooked

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.590 
that's why the chicken wasn't cooked
through<00:04:02.850> because<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.209> going<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.420> cook

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
through because it's going to cook

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.880 
through because it's going to cook
through<00:04:03.780> now<00:04:04.100> go<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.160> over<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.520> heat<00:04:05.670> down<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
through now go to over the heat down to

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.600 
through now go to over the heat down to
about<00:04:07.890> medium<00:04:08.550> medium-low<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:11.400> let<00:04:11.580> it

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
about medium medium-low and just let it

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.480 
about medium medium-low and just let it
cook<00:04:12.290> let<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.410> chicken<00:04:13.740> absorb<00:04:14.100> all<00:04:14.280> those

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490
