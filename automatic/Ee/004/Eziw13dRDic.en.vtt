got one side as you can see all selenium
everything<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.289> crossed<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.520> same<00:00:48.050> all<00:00:49.050> same

ohm loads we got the mids crossed at

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.819 
ohm loads we got the mids crossed at
about<00:00:53.280> 70<00:00:53.730> Hertz<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.410> super<00:00:55.410> tweets<00:00:55.649> are

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
about 70 Hertz and up super tweets are

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.779 
about 70 Hertz and up super tweets are
around<00:00:56.100> 3<00:00:56.460> K<00:00:57.320> 3<00:00:58.320> K<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.680> up<00:01:01.579> fortunately<00:01:02.579> these

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
around 3 K 3 K and up fortunately these

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.859 
around 3 K 3 K and up fortunately these
uh<00:01:04.670> Cadence's<00:01:05.670> are<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.299> smaller<00:01:06.630> than

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
uh Cadence's are little smaller than

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.980 
uh Cadence's are little smaller than
those<00:01:07.220> selenium<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.280> worth<00:01:08.689> but<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:09.869> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
those selenium is worth but there's so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
those selenium is worth but there's so
much<00:01:10.110> sexier<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> yeah<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.479> we're

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
much sexier so yeah here we go we're

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.300 
much sexier so yeah here we go we're
going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> side<00:01:13.500> by<00:01:13.650> side<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.189> the

yeah<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.010> cadence<00:02:44.340> tweets<00:02:44.580> they're<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
yeah the cadence tweets they're on the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.980 
yeah the cadence tweets they're on the
same<00:02:45.060> power<00:02:45.330> probably<00:02:45.540> getting<00:02:45.810> roughly

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
same power probably getting roughly

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.680 
same power probably getting roughly
about<00:02:46.110> 50<00:02:46.620> 60<00:02:46.800> watts<00:02:47.070> RMS<00:02:47.490> each<00:02:47.940> side<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.300> got<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
about 50 60 watts RMS each side I got to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.320 
about 50 60 watts RMS each side I got to
say<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.930> cadence<00:02:49.260> tweet<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.800> far<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.340> yeah

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.730 
say the cadence tweet so far one yeah
it's<00:02:51.510> not<00:02:51.600> even<00:02:51.750> sealed<00:02:52.050> off<00:02:52.170> good<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.530> still

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
got a nice gap here but those things

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120 
got a nice gap here but those things
were<00:02:54.450> fucking<00:02:54.780> putting<00:02:55.050> hours<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.860> tried<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
were fucking putting hours I tried to

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.860 
were fucking putting hours I tried to
get<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> few<00:02:56.460> different<00:02:56.760> angles<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.600> can

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
get a few different angles so you can

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.770 
get a few different angles so you can
see<00:02:58.050> how<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> sounded<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.800> axes<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.790> little

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
see how it sounded on axes and a little

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.080 
see how it sounded on axes and a little
bit<00:03:00.900> off<00:03:01.020> axis<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.740> everything<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.490> yeah<00:03:03.030> I'll

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
bit off axis and everything so yeah I'll

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.460 
bit off axis and everything so yeah I'll
let<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.300> guys<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.720> judge<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:04.110> which<00:03:04.260> ones

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
let you guys be the judge on which ones

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.960 
let you guys be the judge on which ones
you<00:03:04.560> think<00:03:04.590> sounded<00:03:05.100> better<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.580> then<00:03:05.880> which

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you think sounded better and then which

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:46.699 
you think sounded better and then which
ones<00:03:06.180> looked<00:03:06.420> better

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.190 

some<00:03:47.640> more<00:03:47.819> thinking<00:03:48.450> about<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.810> Jeff<00:03:49.019> just

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
some more thinking about it Jeff just

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.080 
some more thinking about it Jeff just
had<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.349> good<00:03:49.530> point<00:03:49.739> we<00:03:50.340> think<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.909> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
had a good point we think that the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.599 
had a good point we think that the
selenium<00:03:51.569> czar<00:03:51.840> louder<00:03:52.310> but<00:03:53.310> they<00:03:53.400> don't

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
selenium czar louder but they don't

selenium czar louder but they don't
sound<00:03:53.819> as<00:03:54.030> good<00:03:54.329> as<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.780> cadence<00:03:55.170> they<00:03:56.040> got

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
sound as good as the cadence they got

I<00:03:58.709> think<00:03:59.069> they're<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> little<00:03:59.430> bit<00:03:59.609> harsher<00:04:00.150> is

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
I think they're a little bit harsher is

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.330 
I think they're a little bit harsher is
the<00:04:00.390> word<00:04:00.569> I<00:04:00.930> think<00:04:01.620> they're<00:04:01.739> both<00:04:01.890> ready<00:04:02.189> to

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340

clarity<00:05:26.110> over<00:05:26.320> here<00:05:26.620> good<00:05:26.770> mid<00:05:27.010> bass<00:05:27.160> both<00:05:27.430> of

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
them got great mid bass but the the

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.610 
them got great mid bass but the the

it's<00:05:32.740> probably<00:05:33.040> got<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:33.250> go<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.400> cadence<00:05:33.850> you

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
it's probably got to go to cadence you

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.310 
it's probably got to go to cadence you
agree<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:35.530> mean<00:05:36.220> these<00:05:36.550> are<00:05:36.730> loud<00:05:37.020> they<00:05:38.020> sound

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
agree I mean these are loud they sound

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.430 
agree I mean these are loud they sound
pretty<00:05:38.560> good<00:05:38.770> but<00:05:39.660> like<00:05:40.660> I<00:05:40.780> said<00:05:40.840> before<00:05:41.110> they

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
pretty good but like I said before they

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.130 
pretty good but like I said before they
got<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:42.030> muffle<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.060> mids<00:05:43.450> have<00:05:43.660> a<00:05:43.690> muffled

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
got a muffle the mids have a muffled

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.690 
got a muffle the mids have a muffled
tone<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.560> tweets<00:05:44.830> aren't<00:05:45.070> as<00:05:45.220> crisp<00:05:45.520> and

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.820 
tone the tweets aren't as crisp and
clear<00:05:46.000> as<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.990> other<00:05:47.110> side<00:05:47.380> playing<00:05:47.710> it

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
clear as the other side playing it

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.410 
clear as the other side playing it
simple<00:05:48.160> I<00:05:48.310> don't<00:05:48.460> know<00:05:48.700> how<00:05:48.850> it<00:05:48.970> transferred

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
simple I don't know how it transferred

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.990 
simple I don't know how it transferred
via<00:05:49.720> video<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.650> guys<00:05:50.680> y'all<00:05:51.610> see<00:05:51.730> my<00:05:51.850> god

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
guess I'll get back home and start

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.390 
guess I'll get back home and start
editing<00:05:59.200> it<00:05:59.470> up<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.830> see<00:05:59.920> if<00:05:59.980> we<00:06:00.070> can<00:06:00.190> tell<00:06:00.310> the

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
editing it up and see if we can tell the

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.850 
editing it up and see if we can tell the
difference<00:06:00.700> in<00:06:00.820> also<00:06:01.240> yeah<00:06:01.990> I'm<00:06:02.500> have<00:06:02.650> to<00:06:02.740> give

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
difference in also yeah I'm have to give

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.470 
difference in also yeah I'm have to give
this<00:06:02.950> round<00:06:03.160> the<00:06:03.280> cadence<00:06:03.640> not<00:06:04.060> just<00:06:04.270> because

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
this round the cadence not just because

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.130 
this round the cadence not just because
that's<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.780> new<00:06:04.900> shit<00:06:05.110> I'm<00:06:05.200> running<00:06:05.760> but<00:06:07.140> that

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
that's the new shit I'm running but that

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.260 
that's the new shit I'm running but that
shit<00:06:08.380> just<00:06:08.620> sounds<00:06:08.950> better<00:06:09.030> hopefully<00:06:10.030> we<00:06:10.150> can

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
shit just sounds better hopefully we can

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.910 
shit just sounds better hopefully we can
do<00:06:10.390> even<00:06:10.720> better<00:06:10.870> comparison<00:06:11.380> when<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:11.710> six

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
do even better comparison when the six

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.100 
do even better comparison when the six
and<00:06:12.040> a<00:06:12.070> half<00:06:12.100> roll<00:06:12.460> in<00:06:12.640> see<00:06:13.360> if<00:06:13.450> we<00:06:13.540> can<00:06:13.720> tell

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
and a half roll in see if we can tell

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.370 
and a half roll in see if we can tell
more<00:06:14.350> of<00:06:14.440> a<00:06:14.530> difference<00:06:14.940> but<00:06:15.940> um<00:06:16.140> your<00:06:17.140> cadence

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
more of a difference but um your cadence

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.150 
more of a difference but um your cadence

the selenium czar bit cheaper than the
