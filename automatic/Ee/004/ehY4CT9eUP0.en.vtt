 on them are colored circles that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.480
 you need to correctly combine the squares 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.879
 plates can be rotated around its axis 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.629
 and swap between each other and more 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.699

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.860
 developers it for a second is 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.330

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.190
 calm the game looks as if 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.769
 splinter cell did guys from team 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.890
 fortress and so cold war 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.540
 Iron Curtain territory of the USSR, we 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.519
 playing for enemy american 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.739
 spy who must neutralize the rocket 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.600
 just about flying to the den and the world 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.799
 democracies on the way we meet 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.420
 ferocious sergeants and dangerous soldiers in 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.940
 the game is quite a large selection of weapons 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.100
 pistol with a silencer and without grenade launchers 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.530
 shotguns and maddening machine guns 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.579
 tranquilizers various locations and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.340
 many easter eggs 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.070
 but naturally abundant cranberry name 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.239
 military units such as the great grandmother 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.430
 17 nuclear strike 37 and so on 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.739
 The application has three levels of difficulty and 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.209
 really every one of them is very complicated 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.040
 the only negative is that 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.079
 the game is not translated into Russian 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.130
 but it seems to me that this is also a part 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.920
 conspiracy 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.260
 the outcome of the game is expensive but good 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.940
