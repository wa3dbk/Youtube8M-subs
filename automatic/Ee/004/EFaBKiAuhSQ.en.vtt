looking at so for example it works in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.040 
looking at so for example it works in
the<00:00:32.430> settings<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.059> works<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.719> phone<00:00:33.899> app

there's actually two ways to do it on
the<00:03:24.200> HTC<00:03:24.560> One<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.400> fastest<00:03:25.850> way<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.209> holding

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
the HTC One the fastest way is holding

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.789 
the HTC One the fastest way is holding
the<00:03:26.600> power<00:03:26.840> button<00:03:26.989> while<00:03:27.410> simultaneously

pressing the home button however in my
experience<00:03:30.769> it<00:03:30.920> isn't<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.340> most<00:03:31.489> accurate

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
experience it isn't the most accurate

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.880 
experience it isn't the most accurate
way<00:03:32.000> which<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.810> me<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.140> holding<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> power
