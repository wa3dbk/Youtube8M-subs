00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
three different ways to do this the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
three different ways to do this the
first<00:00:38.610> way<00:00:38.970> we're<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> sculptural

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
first way we're gonna do a sculptural

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
first way we're gonna do a sculptural
piece<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.340> second<00:00:41.820> way<00:00:41.910> we're<00:00:42.090> gonna<00:00:42.179> use

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
piece the second way we're gonna use

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
piece the second way we're gonna use
stickers<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.769> third<00:00:44.100> way<00:00:44.340> we're<00:00:44.489> gonna

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
stickers and the third way we're gonna

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.090 
stickers and the third way we're gonna
use<00:00:44.789> stamps<00:00:45.449> so<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.989> gonna<00:00:46.289> start<00:00:46.679> with<00:00:46.949> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
use stamps so I'm gonna start with the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.669 
use stamps so I'm gonna start with the
sculptural<00:00:47.609> piece<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.449> this<00:00:48.780> idea<00:00:49.050> came<00:00:49.620> about

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
sculptural piece so this idea came about

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.410 
sculptural piece so this idea came about
when<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.399> doing<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.089> daughter's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
when I was doing at my daughter's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
when I was doing at my daughter's
nursery<00:00:52.019> and<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.800> wanted<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> add<00:00:53.250> some

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
nursery and I wanted to add some

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
nursery and I wanted to add some
dimension<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.179> the<00:00:54.449> walls<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.109> I<00:00:55.379> got<00:00:55.559> this

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
dimension to the walls and I got this

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.239 
dimension to the walls and I got this
idea<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.719> gluing<00:00:57.719> things<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.589> walls<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
idea of gluing things on the walls and a

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.910 
idea of gluing things on the walls and a
pattern<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.850> did<00:01:00.499> butterflies<00:01:01.499> because<00:01:01.769> I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pattern and I did butterflies because I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.290 
pattern and I did butterflies because I
think<00:01:02.129> they're<00:01:02.249> very<00:01:02.460> beautiful<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
think they're very beautiful but you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
think they're very beautiful but you
could<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.629> flowers<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:04.860> son's<00:01:05.100> really

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
could do flowers if your son's really

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
could do flowers if your son's really
interface<00:01:05.880> cars<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.390> could<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.659> some

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
interface cars you could do some

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
interface cars you could do some
racecars<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:09.000> daughter's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
racecars on here if your daughter's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260 
racecars on here if your daughter's
really<00:01:09.930> into<00:01:10.680> things<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.490> sparkly<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
really into things that are sparkly you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
really into things that are sparkly you
could<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.690> this<00:01:12.870> with<00:01:13.110> some<00:01:13.290> gemstones<00:01:13.530> but

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
could do this with some gemstones but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
could do this with some gemstones but
I'm<00:01:14.460> gonna<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> today<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.420> butterflies

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I'm gonna do it today with butterflies

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.240 
I'm gonna do it today with butterflies
which<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.380> ordered<00:01:16.860> off<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.100> internet

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
which I just ordered off the internet

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.789 
which I just ordered off the internet
and<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.000> whole<00:01:18.329> box<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.990> $4.99

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and this whole box was $4.99

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.840 
and this whole box was $4.99
I<00:01:20.100> think<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.909> canvas<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.630> about<00:01:22.070> $6.99<00:01:23.070> so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
I think this canvas was about $6.99 so

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
I think this canvas was about $6.99 so
this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.630> inexpensive<00:01:25.049> piece<00:01:25.890> of
