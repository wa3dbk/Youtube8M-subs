00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
uh with plain it to compensate for

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.539 
uh with plain it to compensate for
whatever<00:03:19.080> sound<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.530> was<00:03:19.680> given<00:03:20.070> at<00:03:20.250> them<00:03:20.400> at

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
the right hand a little softer I would

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.159 
the right hand a little softer I would
just<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.560> was<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:16.799> able<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.640> play<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.239> and

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.909 
just I was just able to play and and
really<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:20.160> freed<00:04:20.609> me<00:04:20.640> as<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.570> as<00:04:22.349> a<00:04:22.380> player<00:04:22.710> it

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
really it freed me as a as a player it

totally<00:04:23.310> freed<00:04:23.580> me<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:24.000> play<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.200> way<00:04:25.410> that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
totally freed me to play in the way that

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.700 
totally freed me to play in the way that
I<00:04:25.620> was<00:04:25.830> feeling<00:04:26.010> at<00:04:26.280> the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
I was feeling at the

I was feeling at the
without<00:04:27.220> having<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.850> think<00:04:28.479> about<00:04:28.690> whether<00:04:29.380> if

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
without having to think about whether if

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.230 
without having to think about whether if
I<00:04:29.830> play<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.759> was<00:04:30.880> going<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.090> come

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
I play that if it was going to come
