00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:14.519
 find the recipes 750 grams with 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.770
 samsung there it's the christmas log 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.090
 yeah we'll make you a worthy recipe 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.560
 of a leader you will see that in fact 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.760
 it's very simple the base is a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.470
 custard you'll see it's going 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.109
 to be hot chocolate passion it's gone 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
 we start to make a cream down 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.010
 the crème anglaise have heated 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.179
 milk ok I have leaves of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.289
 gelatin to make beautiful places I 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.210
 Tempered do in the long well 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.010
 cold leaves one by one it's 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930
 very important to properly hydrate 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.820
 Gelatin sheets 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.579
 this is the second step we are going 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 put half of the sugar in the airlock 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.090
 is a little trick the pastry chef 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.860
 it's because in fact the fus 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.850
 go down to the bottom and that will prevent that 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969
 hang on the bottom but castro is 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.010
 exactly there well after and the other 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.149
 half of the sugar we will put it in the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 yellow and you'll do the famous 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.859
 whitening that does not matter much in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 does it just to mix a little 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.219
 little and look for sugars it's wise 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 does not whiten a lot it's just for 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.630
 not that the yellows burn here is the milk 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.479
 was boiling 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.240
 while the solutions and here we go 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.070
 to make a small premix this is for 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.689
 that when I'm going to mix 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.759
 whole actually is not going to make lumps 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.180
 sim to avoid so people from 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.360
 our kitchens 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.869
 very naturally yes alas in the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.840
 pan 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.170
 we will rifle everyone in grace is on the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.000
 saddle maker his kitchen we put back 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.369
 all the time without stopping for no 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 cinephile that have asked for it 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.950
 behind there at the bottom talk attack and there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.210
 you there we go cura 83 ° if it must be 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.860
 open is 83 ° otherwise little trick 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.380
 so we can take a small stature 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 you have to draw a line with your finger and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.920
 the beautiful remains 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.469
 Here the custard is baked and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:02.450
 here you can see if we try the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.840
 little trick there I turn 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.780
 have you got rahmane 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.959
 I pour everything on the chocolate and the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:18.370
 small ganache in the cra landaise 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:19.720
 Bavarian for my ass mix me this is 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.239
 it must put gelatin 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 while it's hot I take the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.700
 gelatin and I go out I press it 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.379
 to remove water and have hakim rabies 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.450
 add to it and let it melt gently 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.549
 it smells good it smells great milk chocolate 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.079
 to its managers very very well the mixture 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.180
 is homogeneous and we will leave it 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.370
 cool in the refrigerator or under the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.209
 ice cream so that it starts to take 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.209
 thanks to gelatin 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.920
 here is the custard slightly 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.090
 collar begins to take 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.860
 and here we will incorporate a cream 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.599
 whipped one time everything changes we have 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.670
 the legs validated but it's just a 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.590
 fresh cream in a few pictures too 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.420
 too much mounted to make love 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.090
 well air to me it is mounted more air 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.489
 to make a mixture fall half that of 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.620
 near and the meadow but the stake could 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.329
 to whisk gently actually 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.310
 it is to balance the masses 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.660
 to have a balance mass between the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.000
 whipped cream and custard 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.430
 okay collar okay that's enough 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.459
 that's enough to transfer it to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.739
 leftover cream no need actually 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.790
 it's always better to mix two 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.540
 mixtures that have the same texture 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.540
 exactly 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.230
 and there, look at the gesture of 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.269
 pastry chef to gently search for 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.519
 outside and flap in the sense and I turn 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.340
 the ball at the same time I know I'm going 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.210
 everywhere very religious and here I have 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.390
 finished tomorrow 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.160
 so then we go France had in a word 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.600
 the log of agreement in stainless steel or in 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.980
 plastic then there you put what two 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.670
 thirds so here I 'm going to put about 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.660
 two- thirds to know on what the ola 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.100
 in a little liquid it's normal 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.340
 I decided to do his job 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.210
 because here we will add mashed potatoes 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.130
 passion fruit 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.770
 if you do not have one you can 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.510
 business actually with the luscious not 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.980
 sure vintage and then you college 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.080
 slightly warmed slightly 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.200
 put a little bit of gelatin 500 either 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:25.660
 too sweet here I'll give a 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.590
 little my wish is there we resort to a 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.470
 milk chocolate passion is when 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.470
 even a very nice classic accord with 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.470
 I am nobody bonus but yes you saw 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.540
 the benefit we will dip it slightly 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.320
 not too much because I do not want it 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.510
 be too drunk 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.710
 but already - he'll take our tips from 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.430
 orange juice so I have some juice 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:55.570
 fresh orange just not 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.740
 this will be the shock of the log there 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.060
 now the log we're going to put it at 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.710
 freezer because we will work 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.050
 really like pastry chefs 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.490
 we will fill the log for his room where 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.780
 this will allow you to come well 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.610
 molds and Dickens and lost entirely 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.960
 the time then there are some mussels and the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.070
 log she still frozen we're going 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.870
 wait an hour an hour and 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.400
 half to come back and break or 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.350
 holidays quietly but that's the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.850
 the only way to get a job at Beijing 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.890
 did it almost look like foie gras 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.180
 it misses to unlock a real name leaves 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.180
 finally the artist for the decor 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.759
 you have this wonderful goal it's been a 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.979
 little bit more committed and by a real 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.599
 pastry will thank you for mine then 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.599
 here I have nothing to see you soon
