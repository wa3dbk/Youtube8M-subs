00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.880
 hello guys and girls we are in the 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.200
 software 3 in a new event mode and 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.150
 this new movement yes that has 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.580
 agreed on what it was called and called 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.610
 live in ground I do not know pronounced well 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.029
 If I do not care and what is this 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.290
 very easy event mode take away 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.800
 absolutely almost all the weapons of the 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.360
 inventory and leave us the nasser with the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.310
 standard ammunition that we can find 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 the king of the hill annexed him by 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.230
 equipment and a gun with a single bullet 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.510
 so if a single bullet that bullet is not 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.390
 made neither with unicorn's horn nor is 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.489
 forged in the mountains of the Lord of the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.250
 rings' where the ring was forged no no 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.140
 It does not serve us absolutely nothing is 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.390
 a bullet that you shoot and even is not 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.519
 does nothing is like a bullet is like 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.559
 an equal soft air gun is not 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.870
 that kind of event to be fired that 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.480
 closes vain sale that more good 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.360
 absolutely replace all the 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.840
 weapons on the map for a boom yes yes for a 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.700
 boom a single-shot boom and that boom 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 Well, we will have to use them very well 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.480
 because they only put one so that people 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.640
 go for it and go kill yourself yes a 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.340
 kill for him because as you can see there's only 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.940
 a minute of peace of departure there is no more 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.550
 there is only one minute and it has different 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.620
 this game mode to others as it is 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.600
 a movement like I said and mix 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.820
 execution and war zone because mix 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 is anyway I explain to you is a 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.160
 execution because to kill someone or 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.490
 we get very close and what the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.740
 we burst basically or when it's in 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.230
 the ground we make an execution if not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.840
 we can not kill it or there will be no way 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.790
 to kill him we have to get closer 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.350
 expressly kill him and the area 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.390
 war because they give us five deaths 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.370
 only five deaths if they kill us 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.110
 once we do not go back to look like it would be 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.130
 as a search and destroy of colÂ·lectiu 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.420
 you 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.340
 anyone with which the call of 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.429
 duty then they kill you once and no longer 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 reappear again it was good 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.030
 playing with a subscriber 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.989
 it was called silverback and silverback 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.940
 silverback was the robot that had and 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.300
 now I will tell you something was something of silver 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.620
 be rock or something like that I do not remember and good 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.489
 the truth is that it was pretty good 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.440
 playing and here I see some when I kill him and 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.390
 the truth is that it was pretty good 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.030
 I was playing the cantu 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 that a lot of people complain about the campus or 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.500
 anne the female characters because 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.520
 they say that the bullets being written the most 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.650
 they do not penetrate as much and they disperse more and 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.209
 it's much harder to kill the truth 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.220
 is that I did not find the difference 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.900
 I do not find any difference, not what 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.400
 I understand but good the truth is that 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.220
 makes sense because as you see the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.230
 griffin is fatter is more corpulent and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.940
 you can kill him and well it's easier not 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.010
 because the bigger the white is 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.840
 much easier but I also do not find 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.819
 Much difference 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.099
 and as you can see why I'm playing with 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.650
 bots because this is a new event mode 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.900
 of force of nature the force of nature and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.810
 it turns out that very few people play I do not know 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.739
 Yes or because we have bought the maps or 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.120
 because I go wrong online but do not think 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.090
 that I go wrong online because I have 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.069
 very good connection and very good ping but 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.569
 well the aie says a game with a 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.129
 subscriber and the truth is that he does 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.010
 I found it very fast 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.519
 games but very fast surely 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.709
 be for the regional area because good and 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.860
 you know that when you have the console 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:49.120
 you put united states spain mexico 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.610
 live and live in the country that you are and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.590
 clear in Spain at 4 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.420
 there are many people playing and if they play not 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.670
 I think they're going to play be in the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.310
 event modes for which it costs you 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.830
 find departure but good too 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.590
 I have to say it's an event mode 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.990
 this very I have a lot of fun because 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.810
 I will keep in mind that it is very very short 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.959
 but not because it is short it finishes fast 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.420
 because keep in mind that you can stay 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.370
 in neutral in good draw another 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.500
 which is worth noting what happens if the 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.930
 team does not die very easy if the team 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.030
 does not die for example in our team 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.030
 there will be four and in theirs three 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.890
 we would win very much who wins more 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.690
 deaths performed here on the computer the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.640
 team that performs more deaths wins 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.160
 it is simply this 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.780
 here we have vale to silver be rock good 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.670
 if it should be like this this is the subscriber 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.170
 who played with me 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.530
 and the truth is that I had a great time 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.850
 because we were are played very well 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.550
 I'm not going to look like I was 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.560
 very good we did not play well simply 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.030
 this and this is much appreciated that 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.310
 when you play with someone , thank you 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.830
 very much because you do not despair 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.000
 kill or nothing at all the truth is that 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.700
 I had a great time with the cce 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.190
 subscriber and I will do or I will make more 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.870
 achievements or something else for the 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.760
 subscribers already knows and nothing warning 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.600
