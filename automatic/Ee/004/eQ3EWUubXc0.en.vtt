00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.830
 one of Latin America in this video les 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.440
 I'm going to talk about the basic structure 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.429
 of nucleic acids this video already 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 cell biology begins to mix 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:21.029
 with genetics that's why we started 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 to have a transition or a mixture of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 branches of biology 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.650
 the nucleic acids that are known are 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:36.840
 two the famous DNA and on the other hand the 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:40.840
 rn who in the word acid 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.660
 of means of shock yes 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.450
 ribÃ³ and the n nucleicos 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.930
 the same happens with the harness only 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.579
 burn the deoxyribonucleic acid is 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.640
 ribonucleic acid let's see why 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.320
 all right 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 what are they or what is the structure 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:12.650
 basic DNA and rn I am you that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.650
 DNA and rn are biopolymers 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.430
 of nucleotides nucleotides are the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 mono-americ units or units of 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.850
 formation of the nucleic acids of 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.570
 DNA and the network and each nucleotide is 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.009
 It consists of three elements that is one 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.069
 core molecule that is formed to its 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.069
 once for three molecules a sugar 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.640
 which in general is a monosaccharide 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.640
 sucker 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.630
 that in the DNA is the shock itself 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.149
 ribose 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.090
 and in the arn is the ribose remember the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.320
 his sons and the ribose are two suckers 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.050
 that is two monosaccharides the sugars 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.120
 well after they are formed by a group 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.910
 phosphate which is what gives them the character 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.350
 acid 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.030
 we are going to symbolize it to the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.100
 windy we will symbolize it with a 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 pentagon because it has four points 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 each tip would symbolize a carbon and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.550
 for what is known as a base 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 nitrogen 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.470
 the hydrogen base is a molecule that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.290
 It has nitrogen atoms and that's what it's 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.470
 varying from nucleotide to nucleotide is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.920
 they know five nucleotides 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.860
 and this difference between them lies in 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.890
 that the nitrogenous bases are different 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.350
 I'm going to tell you now what these are 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.970
 nitrogenous bases 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.770
 we have 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.540
 bases that are called public because 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.910
 derive from the purine and we have the the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.300
 adenine 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.710
 you are symbolist with the letter and we have 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.790
 the guanine 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.880
 that is symbolist with the letter g 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.650
 and then we have the bases 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.650
 wine piri 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.440
 what are 3 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.440
 thymine 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.440
 treat him 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.440
 cytokine 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.200
 pure cy of thread 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:56.160
 letter o 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:59.290
 well what happens with these bases every and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.959
 the DNA and the rn do not have the same 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:08.459
 I'm going to tell you now what is the 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:13.269
 difference the DNA has guanine adenine 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:18.100
 cytosine and thymine and the air n also 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:20.350
 has four bases only that has 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.860
 adenine 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.290
 guanine cytokine but half tenor thymine 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.540
 change for hours in a row 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.740
 those are the differences between the DNA and 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:37.060
 DNA also what happens 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.569
 with the structure of DNA and DNA 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.970
 arn is said to be a bi molecule 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:46.120
 catenary because it is a molecule that 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.770
 It consists of two chains each of 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.530
 these is a chain of nucleotides 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.800
 we have a chain and another chain two 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.449
 chains 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.999
 instead it's forgiveness the DNA also with 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:07.729
 and the air is a single string is a 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:09.680
 mono catenary molecule why that says 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.150
 DNA has a double - 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.150
 propeller why 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.560
 has these two chains attached to this 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.560
 way well 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.580
 I'm going to erase here because what I want 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:29.509
 do now is draw LEDs basically 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.100
 the structure of a nucleotide so that 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.920
 understand 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.920
 ok, look, we have 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:46.070
 the deoxyribonucleic acid that is if it is the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.639
 adn today the rn then we have the base 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:54.790
 nitrogenated and then we have 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:59.460
 the phosphate molecule or molecule 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.460
 if I want to add more 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.880
 nucleotides 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.880
 for example 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:17.440
 I can go drawing like this and 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:21.250
 let's see that to form a chain 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.680
 of nucleotides let's see how they are going to 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.120
 link 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.000
 we have phosphate and we have phosphate 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.470
 junctions occur between phosphates 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.320
 look there and there and this way they were 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.169
 joining were forming the chains like this 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.660
 I know that this link is known as 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.520
 match 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:48.599
 from esther 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.530
 well and what happens in the DNA in the DNA 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:56.390
 a phenomenon occurs that is called 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:58.430
 complementarity of bases 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.860
 what does this mean of complementarity 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.330
 of bases that since they are two chains and 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.550
 they are confronted by the bases 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.070
 nitrogenated here would be another basis for 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.430
 hydrogen not any base is facing 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.620
 with any other but in the DNA the 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.320
 adenine will always face the 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:18.830
 thymine and cytokines will face 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.930
 always with guanine 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.670
 this always take into account by the 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.560
 theme of base complementarity 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:29.060
 well basically this is what the 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.460
 structure of the nucleic partners of the 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.780
 adn and father m 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.790
 educational I recommend the following 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.790
 videos so you can keep learning
