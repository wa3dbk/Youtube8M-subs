 hello friendly friends of the alien 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 but you can call me bread or bread right 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 as you can see a meeting in a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.609
 different environment I am in my base 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.370
 land of mexico df one of the many 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.020
 secret pass that I have in Mexico 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.450
 I have to say that I really 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.580
 I find very well in these latitudes 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.530
 although good 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 there are many beings of light but there are also 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.000
 pretty reptilian and I have the chakras 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.019
 as crooked 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.969
 I do not eat like the chakra here is going 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.469
 a little over there the chakra here but 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.089
 a little bit for like these days I'm 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.729
 having little time I'm over there 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.370
 for here with my adventure or investigating 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:52.769
 the territory as I said that something that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.389
 I'm going to do what the 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.159
 most among the youtubers when 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.319
 they have time or do not feel like doing 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.559
 another thing not that it's a video from 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.940
 questions and answers and no more 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.500
 delay I will put to answer the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.979
 questions my friends have asked me 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.350
 of the astral for my twitter my facebook and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.900
 in the youtube also that good I leave 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.390
 under 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.060
 the video my social networks in case 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.580
 you want to tell me your life that I 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.010
 tell mine that we give ourselves a little bit 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.220
 of love with me as tone and that kind of 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.280
 things and I have here the question in my 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.440
 cellular and I will go answering the jorge 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.830
 ask me how strong carry 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.870
 adaptation to this planet because I'm going 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.730
 wearing there are days sides that I wear it 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.950
 better and days those who wear it but not 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.890
 I'm a little more used to what 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.190
 it is the gravity of the planet and I fall 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.470
 less it costs me less work 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.840
 unwrap less on the other hand here in 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.740
 the earth like there are many people with 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.890
 inequality or poison problems with 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.530
 food among other things not and that 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.580
 generates that sometimes there is a bit of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.550
 negative vibration but good me then 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.259
 I meditate find the light I start 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.989
 ride with friends from behind 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.480
 what do I get quite happy about 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.110
 general pretty positive ask me 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.909
 how many Earth years do you have then the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.280
 truth is that it is quite difficult 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:26.450
 calculate the terrestrial years that I have 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.299
 not because you have to multiply the years 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.140
 that I lived in to spend for the years that 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:37.129
 I lived in andromeda and then do the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.450
 average calculation of distance in years 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.200
 logical 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.520
 to 120 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.690
 526 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:55.480
 10 56 17 25 if out there hanging around 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.280
 that age and have more or less since 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.680
 wide wonder I ask you to 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.010
 you how many Earth years it seems 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.560
 that I have the snail friend ok to which I 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 asks when will I do the 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.670
 next hangout because the truth is that 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.470
 it's been a while since I want to do it but 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.580
 as I was here and there I have not 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.820
 could not 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.520
 but let's do it for example the 22 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.760
 March appears on Sunday, March 22 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.860
 It will no longer advising on twitter by 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.870
 facebook that I already said that we did 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.260
 social networks and below the video we 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.290
 we see and in the energy that is giving a 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.330
 little bit of light is not bile ask me 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.860
 I would like to know when is your birthday 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.710
 terrestrial my terrestrial birthday 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.110
 it could be March 21 that was the day 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.480
 in which reaches the earth but not 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.770
 we said the calculations with the calendar 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.480
 agastia no 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.900

 done cristian and that has made me in 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.690
 berlin and that they have made me also others 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.030
 friends from the back is that because I 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.550
 I like Mexico so much because I've had 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.980
 a lot of mayan friends there in the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.720
 Orchard and good Mexicans treat me 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.420
 very well and one can end up taking 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.430
 Affection to the people who treat them 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:26.250
 seeing and the place makes people not 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.480
 people make the place as well as 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.450
 country in fine very beautiful very varied 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.340
 with a lot of nature with many places 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.340

 well now the same I live in a country that 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.260
 it's called spain I think the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.500
 galactic configuration 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.830
 will approximately destine me to another 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.930
 country that I still do not know but the truth 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.870
 right now where are my base 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.350
 I find myself comfortable and good

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.520

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.970
 life in andromeda I have to make a 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.700
 clarification I am antro summer but I was born 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.330

 agatha childhood and it was not until 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.740
 I started college that I went to school 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.530
 meritxell just for the truth that in 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.680
 andromeda the college years when 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.510

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.840
 andromeda not also at the university 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.200

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.740
 that was encouragement behind encouragement 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.290
 Well, it says it's been the best years 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.660
 of my life and I remember more beautiful like that 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.630
 how is andromeda and when he invites me to 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.360
 go then andromeda the truth is a place 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.790
 wonderful the sky in the andromeda in 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.540
 multicolored there is a lot of light for everyone 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.970
 sites 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.200
 there are a lot of nature animals very 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.810
 different from the ones here in the 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.500
 earth much tranquility much joy 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.590
 the people of andromeda always vibrate in 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.780
 positive with which there your farm so 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.700
 completely open then you arrive 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.850
 already to another state of consciousness in the 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.560
 that you can also choose how you want 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.650
 let your environment be 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.080
 and good when I have my spaceship 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.150

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.860
 for you ask me when you finish your 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.010
