somebody to sail on a weekend it'll be
good<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.320> 20<00:00:31.590> years<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.369> idea<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
good to about 20 years the idea is it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.790 
good to about 20 years the idea is it
the<00:00:33.239> basic<00:00:33.660> sailing<00:00:34.200> or<00:00:34.320> actually<00:00:34.590> pretty

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the basic sailing or actually pretty

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.490 
the basic sailing or actually pretty
simple<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:36.420> only<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.110> start<00:00:37.350> adding

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
simple it's only when you start adding

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
simple it's only when you start adding
in<00:00:37.770> different<00:00:38.129> kinds<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.520> boat<00:00:38.760> different

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
in different kinds of boat different

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
in different kinds of boat different
kinds<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> conditions<00:00:40.020> more<00:00:40.260> challenging

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
kinds of conditions more challenging

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.069 
kinds of conditions more challenging
stuff<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.790> gets<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.149> lot<00:00:42.300> more<00:00:42.360> involved

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
stuff that it gets a lot more involved

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.950 
stuff that it gets a lot more involved
you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.700> you<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.789> driving<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.270> car<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.809> an

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you know you know driving a car in an

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.180 
you know you know driving a car in an
empty<00:00:46.110> parking<00:00:46.410> lot<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.950> pretty

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
empty parking lot is pretty

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.580 
empty parking lot is pretty
straightforward<00:00:47.570> racing<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> Formula<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.289> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
straightforward racing a Formula one is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
straightforward racing a Formula one is
probably<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.760> harder<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> never<00:00:51.239> done<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
probably a lot harder and never done it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.610 
probably a lot harder and never done it
before<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.020> imagine<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.440> anyway<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> wanted

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
before but imagine so so anyway I wanted

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.950 
before but imagine so so anyway I wanted
to<00:00:55.829> talk<00:00:56.010> about<00:00:56.239> dinghy<00:00:57.239> sailing<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.809> why<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
to talk about dinghy sailing and why I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720 
to talk about dinghy sailing and why I
think<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.500> great<00:00:58.649> number<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> dinghy

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
think it's so great number one to dinghy

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
think it's so great number one to dinghy
I'm<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.480> bought<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.109> 500<00:01:01.620> bucks

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
I'm in right now I bought for 500 bucks

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880 
I'm in right now I bought for 500 bucks
so<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:03.030> sells<00:01:03.270> new<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.960> 800<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so it sells new for 800 and like a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.070 
so it sells new for 800 and like a
thousands<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> sail<00:01:05.760> kit<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
thousands of the sail kit and then I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.149 
thousands of the sail kit and then I
think<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.320> put<00:01:07.500> some<00:01:07.619> more<00:01:07.740> mods<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.130> here

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
think they put some more mods on here

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.390 
think they put some more mods on here
too<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.049> bought<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.799> 500<00:01:11.250> use

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
too and I think I bought it for 500 use

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
too and I think I bought it for 500 use
so<00:01:11.939> number<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.900> buy<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> dinghy

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
so number one you can buy a dinghy

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
so number one you can buy a dinghy
really<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.100> cheap<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.000> small<00:01:15.210> enough

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
really really cheap this is small enough

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.609 
really really cheap this is small enough
to<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.630> strap<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> hood<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.470> car

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to get strap it on the hood of a car

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
to get strap it on the hood of a car
roof<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> car<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.880> think<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.119> would

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
roof of a car I don't think that would

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.670 
roof of a car I don't think that would
be<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.509> idea<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> strap<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.500> on

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
be a good idea so you can strap it on

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.670 
be a good idea so you can strap it on
the<00:01:19.710> roof<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> car<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.170> drag<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.590> out

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

you<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:09.000> know<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.209> you're<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.050> know

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
you you know if you're on a you know

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.500 
you you know if you're on a you know
40-foot<00:03:10.709> Valiant<00:03:11.160> which<00:03:11.280> by<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.580> way<00:03:11.730> they're

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
40-foot Valiant which by the way they're

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.090 
40-foot Valiant which by the way they're
great<00:03:12.660> if<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.830> want<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> give

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
great if you have one you want to give

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.370 
great if you have one you want to give
it<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.310> love<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.670> but<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.200> problem

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
it to I love it but you know the problem

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.199 
it to I love it but you know the problem
is<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:16.890> there's<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.459> much<00:03:17.610> sail<00:03:17.910> up<00:03:18.090> in

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
is is that there's so much sail up in

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.790 
is is that there's so much sail up in
the<00:03:18.300> air<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:19.050> have<00:03:19.200> these<00:03:19.380> big<00:03:19.590> full

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
the air and they have these big full

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.390 
the air and they have these big full
keels<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.900> really<00:03:22.260> could<00:03:22.769> mess<00:03:23.070> them<00:03:23.280> up

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
keels that you really could mess them up

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.850 
keels that you really could mess them up
and<00:03:23.640> have<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.970> terrible<00:03:24.540> sail<00:03:24.750> trim<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.320> have

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
and have a terrible sail trim and have

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.290 
and have a terrible sail trim and have
way<00:03:26.130> over<00:03:26.400> rudder<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.880> you're<00:03:27.090> still

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
way over rudder and you're still

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.960 
way over rudder and you're still
probably<00:03:27.510> going<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.840> get<00:03:27.989> where<00:03:28.140> you're<00:03:28.260> going

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
probably going to get where you're going

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.420 
probably going to get where you're going
but<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:31.170> learning<00:03:32.160> how<00:03:32.310> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
but that's not really learning how to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.250 
but that's not really learning how to
sail<00:03:32.670> really<00:03:33.030> well<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:33.930> you're<00:03:34.140> not

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
sail really well you know you're not

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.870 
sail really well you know you're not
you're<00:03:34.500> not<00:03:34.560> really<00:03:34.650> getting<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> basics<00:03:35.670> and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
you're not really getting the basics and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.340 
you're not really getting the basics and
you're<00:03:36.239> not<00:03:36.360> getting<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.690> essentials

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
you're not getting the essentials

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.320 
you're not getting the essentials
because<00:03:37.980> there's<00:03:38.220> too<00:03:38.519> much<00:03:38.700> stuff<00:03:39.000> between

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
because there's too much stuff between

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.050 
because there's too much stuff between
you<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.590> controls<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.670> controls

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
you and the controls and the controls

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.770 
you and the controls and the controls
really<00:03:42.750> are<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> rudder<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.709> your<00:03:43.920> sails

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
really are the rudder and your sails

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.660 
really are the rudder and your sails
that's<00:03:45.780> about<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.280> want<00:03:47.580> to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
that's about it you know so you want to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.610 
that's about it you know so you want to
be<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.880> as<00:03:48.000> much<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.959> want<00:03:49.140> if<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.380> want<00:03:49.530> to

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
be in as much you want if you want to

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.009 
be in as much you want if you want to
have<00:03:49.830> as<00:03:50.130> little<00:03:50.730> as<00:03:50.880> possible<00:03:51.060> between<00:03:51.750> you

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
have as little as possible between you

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.539 
have as little as possible between you
and<00:03:52.200> those<00:03:52.290> things<00:03:52.650> when<00:03:53.220> you're<00:03:53.340> first

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
and those things when you're first

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.500 
and those things when you're first
learning<00:03:54.209> how<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.630> sail<00:03:55.700> because<00:03:56.700> when<00:03:57.420> you

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
learning how to sail because when you

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.030 
learning how to sail because when you
get<00:03:57.630> on<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> bigger<00:03:58.019> boat<00:03:58.350> there's<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:58.860> more

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
get on a bigger boat there's just more

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.680 
get on a bigger boat there's just more
stuff<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.400> have<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.610> deal<00:03:59.820> with<00:04:00.030> but<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
stuff you have to deal with but the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.720 
stuff you have to deal with but the
essential<00:04:01.140> basics<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:02.130> really<00:04:02.400> want<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.610> have

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
essential basics you really want to have

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.810 
essential basics you really want to have
that<00:04:02.910> stuff<00:04:03.120> locked<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.600> so<00:04:04.519> you<00:04:05.519> know<00:04:05.610> that's

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
that stuff locked in so you know that's

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.400 
that stuff locked in so you know that's
kind<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.239> my<00:04:06.390> that's<00:04:06.630> kind<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.840> my<00:04:06.930> reasons<00:04:07.350> for

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
kind of my that's kind of my reasons for

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.090 
kind of my that's kind of my reasons for
it

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
it

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.640 
it
you<00:04:08.489> know<00:04:08.610> it's<00:04:08.910> cheaper<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.450> get<00:04:09.630> into<00:04:09.959> if<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
you know it's cheaper to get into if you

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.979 
you know it's cheaper to get into if you
decide<00:04:10.920> sailings<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:11.519> your<00:04:11.700> thing<00:04:11.940> or<00:04:12.269> you

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
decide sailings not your thing or you

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.210 
decide sailings not your thing or you
know<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.170> want<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.530> take<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.739> boat<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:13.950> put
