00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.830 
up coming out using this comb just to
change<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.000> curl<00:02:37.000> pattern<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.480> little<00:02:37.600> bit

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
change the curl pattern a little bit

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.410 
change the curl pattern a little bit
kind<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.050> open<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.470> up<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.370> was<00:02:39.490> bigger

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
kind of open it up so that it was bigger

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.030 
kind of open it up so that it was bigger
because<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.930> hair<00:02:41.080> was<00:02:41.200> really<00:02:41.470> flat<00:02:41.770> and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
because this hair was really flat and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.460 
because this hair was really flat and
then<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.220> had<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.460> cut<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.670> lot<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.470> 14

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
then I had to cut a lot of the 14

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.020 
then I had to cut a lot of the 14
because<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.890> 14<00:02:45.250> was<00:02:45.370> like<00:02:45.490> down<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:45.700> but

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
because the 14 was like down here but

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.140 
because the 14 was like down here but
the<00:02:46.090> 12<00:02:46.330> was<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.630> up<00:02:46.780> here<00:02:46.810> somehow<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:49.030> I've

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
the 12 was like up here somehow so I've

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.180 
the 12 was like up here somehow so I've
got<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> lot<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.560> longest<00:02:51.010> length

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
got a lot of the the longest length

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.010 
got a lot of the the longest length
which<00:02:51.370> was<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> 14<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.690> he<00:02:52.780> could

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
which was the 14 just so that he could

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.770 
which was the 14 just so that he could
kind<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.920> have<00:02:54.070> some<00:02:54.460> kind<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.820> shape<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.750> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
kind of have some kind of shape to it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.570 
kind of have some kind of shape to it
even<00:02:56.290> after<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.710> screw<00:02:57.010> up<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.220> combed<00:02:57.430> it

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
even after I screw up and I combed it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.729 
even after I screw up and I combed it
out<00:03:00.780> that's<00:03:01.780> pretty<00:03:01.989> much<00:03:02.110> it

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
out that's pretty much it

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.640 
out that's pretty much it
the<00:03:02.950> hairs<00:03:03.190> soft<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:04.450> does<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:04.900> shed<00:03:05.260> much
