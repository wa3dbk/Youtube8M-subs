three parts to the calculator the first

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.890 
three parts to the calculator the first
part<00:02:22.730> looks<00:02:23.060> at<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.359> costs<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.780> doing

part looks at the costs of doing
telemarketing

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
telemarketing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.580 
telemarketing
covers<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.850> costs<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.300> staff<00:02:26.810> overheads

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
covers the costs of staff overheads

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.100

systems and management costs the key

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.020 
systems and management costs the key
thing<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.920> costs<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.670> vary

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
thing here is that costs do vary

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.360 
thing here is that costs do vary
dramatically<00:02:32.840> from<00:02:32.960> country<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.860> country<00:02:33.950> and

in particular employer on costs are very

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.760 
in particular employer on costs are very
different<00:02:37.280> across<00:02:37.820> Europe<00:02:38.290> secondly<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.590> look

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
different across Europe secondly we look

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.860 
different across Europe secondly we look
at<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.920> size<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> price<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:41.360> involves
