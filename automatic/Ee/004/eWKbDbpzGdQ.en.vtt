anyways um this puzzle stump knee it's a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.540 
anyways um this puzzle stump knee it's a
mate<00:00:24.570> into<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:27.949> i've<00:00:28.949> been<00:00:29.010> looking<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.519> for

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
mate into and i've been looking at for

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.979 
mate into and i've been looking at for
20-30<00:00:30.150> minutes<00:00:30.480> now<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:32.329> yeah<00:00:33.329> let's<00:00:33.690> go

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
20-30 minutes now and yeah let's go

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.479 
20-30 minutes now and yeah let's go
there<00:00:36.050> it's<00:00:37.050> made<00:00:37.320> into<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.010> i've<00:00:38.489> only<00:00:38.610> found

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
there it's made into and i've only found

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.240 
there it's made into and i've only found
I've<00:00:41.489> only<00:00:41.579> found<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.270> mate<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.140> three<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:46.250> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
I've only found a mate in three and the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
I've only found a mate in three and the
main<00:00:47.399> theory<00:00:47.670> goes<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:49.530> could<00:00:49.680> be

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
main theory goes like this it could be

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.670 
main theory goes like this it could be
taking<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.489> time<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> analyze<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080 

I'm<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.860> checking<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.520> can't<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.910> go

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I'm in checking out so I can't just go

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.470 
I'm in checking out so I can't just go
ahead<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> rate<00:00:58.489> that's<00:00:59.489> probably<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.090> delay

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
ahead and rate that's probably the delay

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.660 
ahead and rate that's probably the delay
i'm<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.109> sure<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.710> made<00:01:01.980> into<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
i'm not sure if it's made into with the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.429 
i'm not sure if it's made into with the
delay<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.600> if<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.750> take<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> night

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
delay it and if you take with the night

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.190 
delay it and if you take with the night
then<00:01:08.040> i<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.700> mate<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.270> keep<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> mind

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
then i have mate here keep that in mind

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.460 
then i have mate here keep that in mind

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so there's a mate here if you think of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
so there's a mate here if you think of
the<00:01:13.560> nite<00:01:13.710> ize<00:01:13.860> having<00:01:14.220> made<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:15.470> well<00:01:17.060> let's

let's see here you can go ahead right
now<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> um<00:01:22.369> pause<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.610> video<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
now and you can um pause the video and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.980 
now and you can um pause the video and
check<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:26.330> don't<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.479> anything<00:01:27.720> else

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
check it out I don't see anything else

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
because if you take here check you have

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
because if you take here check you have
a<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:30.930> escape<00:01:31.320> squared<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
a little escape squared and not going to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.640 
a little escape squared and not going to
take<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
take it's good it's going to take one to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.960 
take it's good it's going to take one to
move<00:01:34.829> through<00:01:35.070> you're<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.579> chasing

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
move through you're going to be chasing

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.600 
rating threats I like here wait yeah
like<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:58.110> even<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> mate<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.460> am<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
like here not even to mate now what am I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.950 
like here not even to mate now what am I
thinking<00:02:00.320> there's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.439> bishop<00:02:01.950> here<00:02:02.960> alright

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
thinking there's a bishop here alright

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.380 
thinking there's a bishop here alright
anyways

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
anyways

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.370 
anyways
and<00:02:06.310> taking<00:02:07.310> simply<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.360> bishop<00:02:08.690> won't<00:02:09.200> do

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
and taking simply the bishop won't do

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.180 
and taking simply the bishop won't do
much<00:02:09.619> because<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:11.060> have<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.920> computer<00:02:12.920> has

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
much because you have the computer has

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.800 
much because you have the computer has
takes<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:16.640> not<00:02:16.940> going<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.270> do<00:02:17.390> much<00:02:17.569> for

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
takes and it's not going to do much for

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.100 
takes and it's not going to do much for
you<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.790> try<00:02:20.030> night<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:20.870> them<00:02:21.020> to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
you you can try night with them to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.070 
you you can try night with them to
computer<00:02:21.440> has<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:22.240> slide<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.270> walk<00:02:23.600> over<00:02:23.900> and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
computer has a slide to walk over and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.030 
computer has a slide to walk over and
the<00:02:24.380> night<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.800> strength<00:02:25.070> threatening<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the night is the strength threatening a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.060 
the night is the strength threatening a
checkmate<00:02:28.040> here<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.370> then<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> whole<00:02:31.850> check

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
checkmate here and then the whole check

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.140 
checkmate here and then the whole check
there's<00:02:34.070> not<00:02:34.250> much<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.520> can<00:02:34.790> do<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:34.940> this

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
there's not much you can do in this

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.850 
there's not much you can do in this
position<00:02:35.600> other<00:02:35.870> than<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.260> made<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.620> three

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
position other than that made in three

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.160 
position other than that made in three
that<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.130> saw<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.640> I've<00:02:38.630> been<00:02:38.750> looking<00:02:39.050> at<00:02:39.140> some

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
that I saw and I've been looking at some
