00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
what each option changes so that you can

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
what each option changes so that you can

you'll<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.189> look<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> rendering

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you'll want to look at is the rendering

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.120 
resolution at which the game render
hence<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.060> name<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.679> recommend<00:02:08.679> setting<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.009> to

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
hence the name I recommend setting it to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.760 
hence the name I recommend setting it to
100%<00:02:09.580> initially<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.690> only<00:02:11.140> reducing<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.680> if

100% initially and only reducing it if

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.650 
100% initially and only reducing it if
your<00:02:11.890> framerate<00:02:12.130> refuses<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.880> stay<00:02:13.090> above<00:02:13.390> 30

your framerate refuses to stay above 30
even<00:02:14.140> after<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> tried<00:02:14.860> every<00:02:15.310> possible<00:02:15.880> fix

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
even after you tried every possible fix

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.360 
even after you tried every possible fix
a<00:02:16.360> lower<00:02:17.110> rendering<00:02:17.650> resolution<00:02:17.800> can

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
a lower rendering resolution can

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.370 
a lower rendering resolution can
drastically<00:02:18.700> improve<00:02:19.360> your<00:02:19.510> framerate<00:02:19.780> but

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
drastically improve your framerate but

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.020 
drastically improve your framerate but
everything<00:02:20.890> will<00:02:21.010> appear<00:02:21.160> much<00:02:21.670> blurrier

which<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.840> be<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> huge<00:02:23.260> problem<00:02:23.709> if<00:02:23.830> you're

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
which can be a huge problem if you're

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.020 
which can be a huge problem if you're
trying<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.280> tell<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.520> difference<00:02:24.760> between<00:02:24.790> a

disabling it as well edge smoothing is a

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.360 
disabling it as well edge smoothing is a
less<00:04:39.660> in-depth<00:04:40.110> version<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.560> anti-aliasing

so<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.580> recommend<00:04:42.030> disabling<00:04:43.099> HDR<00:04:44.099> quality
