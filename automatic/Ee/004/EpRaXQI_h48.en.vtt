 makeup what puts it to the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.650
 makeup on the year even if I think 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.910
 that I still have some shopping going 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.710

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.240
 big part so they're done in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.430
 twice in two it's good to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.199
 different it will make fields-elysÃ©es 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.090
 strong enough a little closer to home 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 I had to get them twice 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.920

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.750
 sephora had left there who the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.510

 cobalt mouth which is kind montmagny 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.510
 but there are other things in which 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.860
 should this time be in 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.320
 department stores and annalynne with 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.980

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.769
 that it makes envious then what is it 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.250
 lips 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.720
 and also I resumed my election of 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.600
 marabout but that you know it's 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.970
 my oath and lastly I took in 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.590
 double because actually when there are two 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.630
 years we had released a regretted 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.150
 not to have bought so all 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.800
 pallets of bluff from naf so this 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.110
 year he makes it two years after the lady 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.740

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.600
 this to the palette that is called wine wine 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.340
 maiden that I harassed all the sephora 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.919
 to know when is who was receiving it 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.049
 so that they put me aside and therefore 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.390
 I managed to have double as 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.040
 I wanted it so she introduces herself 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.400
 like that so always with this little 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.360
 symbolic shalev treasure of the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:36.880
 collection of clubs and so that's it 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.590
 how to present the colors so 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.750
 here you have vote mistinguett 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.070

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.250

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.970

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.350

 from the bigourdans collection is 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.570
 on gramat department stores so this one 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.550
 it's called crimes of passion we 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.060
 let's see a video review of it 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.919
 soon in which you have the 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:44.590
 gloss ten pilots 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:47.919
 if I'm not mistaken it's wounded 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.510
 to that the gloss detroit three blushes to 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:54.760
 eyelids that gives an awesome smoky look 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.600
 and bronzer you have laguna 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.920
 and in blush you have teachout here 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.260
 edmond that's really great especially 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.940
 near location for bloss you will see 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.250
 in the reviewed video it's the same size 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.810
 that all the mini gloss the ars so when 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.260
 you have a gold trading you can the 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.090
 put inside 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.560
 and like that after carrying it everywhere 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.650
 so this one is a little bit more 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.930
 thick at the level of peace here we are 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.190

 a lot of things 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.830
 I have to design it so here is so 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.360

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.070

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.930

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.220
 the object of a ball dhow we'll see 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.110
