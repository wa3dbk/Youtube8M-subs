facing<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.150> it's<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.479> be<00:01:55.600> quite<00:01:55.780> tricky

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
facing and it's going to be quite tricky

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.620 
facing and it's going to be quite tricky
to<00:01:56.259> capture<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.130> northeast<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.270> facing

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
to capture that northeast and facing

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.120 
to capture that northeast and facing
fake<00:01:58.869> face<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.680> building

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
fake face of the building

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.910 
fake face of the building
if<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:01.060> hit<00:02:01.240> hybrid<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.350> get<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> very<00:02:02.770> useful

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
if you hit hybrid you get a very useful

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.940 
if you hit hybrid you get a very useful
overlay<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.509> road<00:02:04.720> names<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.770> tube

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
overlay of the road names and the tube

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.789 
overlay of the road names and the tube
stations<00:02:06.399> etc<00:02:07.030> other<00:02:07.509> landmarks<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.560> where

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
stations etc other landmarks of where

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.859 
stations etc other landmarks of where
you're<00:02:08.920> shooting<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.939> that's<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.599> one<00:02:10.720> that

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
you're shooting and that's the one that

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.179 
you're shooting and that's the one that
I<00:02:10.899> tend<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.200> print<00:02:11.499> out<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.829> take<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.129> the

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
I tend to print out and take on the

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.970 
I tend to print out and take on the
shoot<00:02:12.400> with<00:02:12.579> me<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.659> can<00:02:13.840> save<00:02:14.139> this<00:02:14.379> location

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
shoot with me you can save this location

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.309 
shoot with me you can save this location
to<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.189> bank<00:02:15.519> of<00:02:15.669> locations<00:02:16.239> for<00:02:16.419> future<00:02:16.480> use

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
to a bank of locations for future use

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.899 
to a bank of locations for future use
simply<00:02:17.739> by<00:02:17.890> hitting<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.310> add<00:02:18.459> button<00:02:18.879> and

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
simply by hitting the add button and

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.819 
simply by hitting the add button and
that's<00:02:19.569> really<00:02:19.870> helpful<00:02:20.109> I<00:02:20.319> often<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.799> to

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
that's really helpful I often have to

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.069 
that's really helpful I often have to
shoot<00:02:21.129> building<00:02:21.939> projects<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.659> shoot

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
shoot building projects and the shoot

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.800 
shoot building projects and the shoot
might<00:02:23.290> go<00:02:23.469> on<00:02:23.999> every<00:02:24.999> three<00:02:25.269> months<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.659> might

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
might go on every three months I might

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.929 
might go on every three months I might
go<00:02:25.959> back<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.379> project<00:02:26.769> for<00:02:26.950> 18<00:02:27.549> months<00:02:27.700> or

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
go back to the project for 18 months or

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.879 
go back to the project for 18 months or
so<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.659> rather<00:02:28.959> than<00:02:29.139> having<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.499> enter<00:02:29.799> the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
so so rather than having to enter the

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.830 
so so rather than having to enter the
coordinates<00:02:30.129> every<00:02:30.670> time<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.450> light<00:02:31.659> will

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
coordinates every time the light will

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.720 
coordinates every time the light will
change<00:02:31.870> over<00:02:32.409> that<00:02:32.530> time<00:02:32.799> I<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.549> have<00:02:33.700> a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
change over that time I can just have a

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.149 
change over that time I can just have a
bank<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.239> useful<00:02:34.719> regularly<00:02:35.709> visited

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
bank of useful regularly visited

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.839 
bank of useful regularly visited
projects<00:02:36.639> here<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:39.069> much<00:02:39.219> for<00:02:39.400> establishing

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
projects here so much for establishing

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.699 
projects here so much for establishing
the<00:02:40.090> location<00:02:40.689> and<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> orientation<00:02:41.349> of<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
the location and the orientation of the

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.170 
the location and the orientation of the
building<00:02:42.069> where<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.670> photographer's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
building where the photographer's

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.149 
building where the photographer's
ephemeris<00:02:43.299> really<00:02:44.169> comes<00:02:44.349> into<00:02:44.650> its<00:02:44.769> own<00:02:44.919> is

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
ephemeris really comes into its own is

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.159 
ephemeris really comes into its own is
telling<00:02:45.549> us<00:02:45.639> exactly<00:02:45.849> how<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.689> sunlight<00:02:46.959> is

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.169 
telling us exactly how that sunlight is

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.500 
telling us exactly how that sunlight is
going<00:02:47.409> to<00:02:47.499> move<00:02:47.739> across<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.519> building<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.450> if

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
going to move across the building so if

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.349 
going to move across the building so if
you<00:02:49.599> go<00:02:49.719> to<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.959> ephemeris<00:02:50.709> tab<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:52.239> can

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
you go to the ephemeris tab you can

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.670 
you go to the ephemeris tab you can
start<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.810> really<00:02:53.019> bring<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.349> thing<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> life

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
start to really bring this thing to life

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.439 
start to really bring this thing to life
and<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.730> first<00:02:54.969> thing<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.150> draw<00:02:55.329> your

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:55.449 
and the first thing I draw your

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.720 
and the first thing I draw your
attention<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.199> to<00:02:56.530> enter<00:02:56.949> the<00:02:57.099> date<00:02:57.430> on

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
attention to is to enter the date on

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.699 
attention to is to enter the date on
which<00:02:57.939> you<00:02:58.000> plan<00:02:58.389> to<00:02:58.419> do<00:02:58.689> the<00:02:58.840> shoot<00:02:59.079> very

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
which you plan to do the shoot very

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.890 
which you plan to do the shoot very
often<00:02:59.919> my<00:03:00.010> shoots<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.459> be<00:03:00.609> set<00:03:01.269> sometime<00:03:01.780> in

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
often my shoots can be set sometime in

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.909 
often my shoots can be set sometime in
the<00:03:01.959> future<00:03:02.109> because<00:03:02.500> they're<00:03:02.650> waiting<00:03:02.889> for

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
the future because they're waiting for

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.949 
the future because they're waiting for
building<00:03:03.370> works<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.730> be<00:03:03.849> completed<00:03:04.359> so<00:03:04.840> you've

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
building works to be completed so you've

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.720 
building works to be completed so you've
got<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.079> calendar<00:03:05.500> here<00:03:05.680> we<00:03:05.829> can<00:03:05.980> plug<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.310> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
got a calendar here we can plug in the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.240 
got a calendar here we can plug in the
actual<00:03:07.269> date<00:03:07.540> on<00:03:07.780> which<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.079> want<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.439> see<00:03:08.709> how

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
actual date on which you want to see how

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.039 
actual date on which you want to see how
the<00:03:09.310> light<00:03:09.639> moves<00:03:10.030> across<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.540> building<00:03:10.719> and

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
the light moves across the building and

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.149 
the light moves across the building and
it's<00:03:11.859> simply<00:03:12.189> a<00:03:12.250> case<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.760> moving<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.840> slider

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
it's simply a case of moving this slider

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.220 
it's simply a case of moving this slider
which<00:03:15.159> brings<00:03:16.060> up<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.919> Rising<00:03:17.919> Sun<00:03:19.019> which<00:03:20.019> is

which brings up the Rising Sun which is

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.580 
which brings up the Rising Sun which is

that very thin yellow line there we see

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.939 
that very thin yellow line there we see

North Eastern face is going to be really
quite<00:03:42.609> nicely<00:03:43.000> illuminated<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.650> about<00:03:44.949> 9:30

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
quite nicely illuminated and about 9:30

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.849 
quite nicely illuminated and about 9:30
it<00:03:45.909> really<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.329> going<00:03:46.509> to<00:03:46.569> look<00:03:46.720> great<00:03:47.079> but

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
it really is going to look great but

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.580 
it really is going to look great but
what's<00:03:48.069> really<00:03:48.489> important<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:49.479> that<00:03:49.590> by

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
what's really important is that by

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.429 
what's really important is that by
eleven<00:03:51.489> o'clock<00:03:51.579> it's<00:03:52.180> really<00:03:52.720> all<00:03:52.870> over<00:03:53.290> and

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 
eleven o'clock it's really all over and

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.490 
eleven o'clock it's really all over and
certainly<00:03:54.220> 11:30<00:03:55.030> if<00:03:55.540> I'm<00:03:55.810> over<00:03:56.109> here<00:03:56.259> across

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
certainly 11:30 if I'm over here across

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.050 
certainly 11:30 if I'm over here across
the<00:03:56.739> road<00:03:56.769> photographing<00:03:57.549> this<00:03:57.639> side<00:03:57.849> of<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
the road photographing this side of the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.399 
the road photographing this side of the
building<00:03:58.209> I'm<00:03:58.569> going<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.049> get<00:03:59.169> absolutely

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
building I'm going to get absolutely

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.429 
building I'm going to get absolutely
nothing<00:04:00.040> in<00:04:00.370> my<00:04:00.519> shot<00:04:00.849> so<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:02.290> first<00:04:02.949> hit<00:04:03.669> of

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
nothing in my shot so that first hit of

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.599 
nothing in my shot so that first hit of
establishing<00:04:05.439> when<00:04:05.889> my<00:04:06.099> window<00:04:06.489> of

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
establishing when my window of

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.360 
establishing when my window of
opportunity<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.209> going<00:04:07.509> to<00:04:07.629> be<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:08.439> half<00:04:09.129> the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
opportunity is going to be is half the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.959 
opportunity is going to be is half the
battle<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.939> getting<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.299> really<00:04:10.509> good<00:04:10.750> shot

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:11.969 
battle and getting a really good shot

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.319 
battle and getting a really good shot
and<00:04:12.969> the<00:04:13.870> flip<00:04:14.169> side<00:04:14.199> to<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:14.799> is<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:16.060> other

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
and the flip side to this is this other

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.959 
and the flip side to this is this other
side<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.719> the<00:04:16.930> building<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.769> western<00:04:18.340> side<00:04:18.579> I

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:18.969 
side of the building the western side I

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.529 
side of the building the western side I
can<00:04:19.659> also<00:04:19.810> find<00:04:20.199> out<00:04:20.469> later<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.609> day<00:04:21.909> when

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
can also find out later in the day when

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.450 
can also find out later in the day when
that's<00:04:22.780> going<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.080> look<00:04:23.199> good<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.919> if<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.190> move

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
that's going to look good is if I move

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.950 
that's going to look good is if I move
my<00:04:24.810> pointer<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.469> side<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.949> building

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
my pointer to that side of the building

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.029 
my pointer to that side of the building
and<00:04:28.110> again<00:04:28.710> progress<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.970> Sun<00:04:30.500> -<00:04:31.500> later<00:04:31.770> in

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
and again progress the Sun - later in

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.610 
and again progress the Sun - later in
the<00:04:32.160> afternoon<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.880> can<00:04:33.720> find<00:04:33.960> out<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.410> point

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
the afternoon I can find out the point

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.279 
the afternoon I can find out the point
of<00:04:34.860> which<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.940> sunlight<00:04:36.270> starts<00:04:37.110> to

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
of which the sunlight starts to

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.490 
of which the sunlight starts to
illuminate<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:39.270> side<00:04:39.509> of<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.720> building<00:04:40.110> so

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
illuminate that side of the building so

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.680 
illuminate that side of the building so
at<00:04:40.560> about<00:04:40.770> 2:30<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.520> afternoon<00:04:41.690> it's

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
at about 2:30 in the afternoon it's

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.080 
at about 2:30 in the afternoon it's
starting<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.229> look<00:04:43.380> good<00:04:43.490> but<00:04:44.490> really<00:04:44.850> for<00:04:45.030> a

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
starting to look good but really for a

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.999 
starting to look good but really for a
nice<00:04:45.300> shot<00:04:45.600> where<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.930> sun's<00:04:46.169> fully<00:04:46.620> on<00:04:46.800> it

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
nice shot where the sun's fully on it

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.820 
nice shot where the sun's fully on it
I'm<00:04:47.220> kind<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:47.970> calculating<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.780> 5:30<00:04:49.650> is

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
I'm kind of calculating that 5:30 is

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.890 
I'm kind of calculating that 5:30 is
going<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.250> good<00:04:50.520> time<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:51.060> be<00:04:51.570> around

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
going to be a good time to be around

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.200 
going to be a good time to be around
here<00:04:52.350> shooting<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.460> side<00:04:53.789> of<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.030> building

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
here shooting this side of the building

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.219 
here shooting this side of the building
so<00:04:54.710> let's<00:04:55.710> have<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.889> look<00:04:56.009> at<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.310> real-world

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
so let's have a look at the real-world

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.999 
so let's have a look at the real-world
examples<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:59.300> that's<00:05:00.300> my<00:05:00.509> morning<00:05:00.900> shot<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.770> I

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
examples and that's my morning shot so I

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.100 
examples and that's my morning shot so I
was<00:05:02.190> over<00:05:02.340> this<00:05:02.580> side<00:05:02.789> of<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.000> street<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.780> Sun

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
was over this side of the street the Sun

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.189 
was over this side of the street the Sun
came<00:05:04.410> round<00:05:04.710> about<00:05:05.360> 9:30<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.780> was<00:05:06.960> looking

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
came round about 9:30 it was looking

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.839 
came round about 9:30 it was looking
really<00:05:07.500> good<00:05:07.800> through<00:05:08.039> here<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.460> was<00:05:08.639> able<00:05:08.729> to

really good through here I was able to

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.080 
really good through here I was able to
get<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.210> shot<00:05:09.509> and<00:05:09.750> then<00:05:10.639> later<00:05:11.639> on<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.000> the

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
building the photographer's ephemeris

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.600 
building the photographer's ephemeris
also<00:05:24.030> told<00:05:24.300> me<00:05:24.449> at<00:05:24.570> what<00:05:24.810> point<00:05:25.430> twilight<00:05:26.430> was

look really good and I was going to get
a<00:05:31.860> window<00:05:32.130> about<00:05:32.639> 20<00:05:33.090> minutes<00:05:33.419> where<00:05:34.050> I<00:05:34.080> had

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
a window about 20 minutes where I had

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.290 
a window about 20 minutes where I had
this<00:05:34.380> nice<00:05:34.740> effect<00:05:34.979> between<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.550> interior

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
this nice effect between the interior

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.930 
this nice effect between the interior
and<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.539> exterior<00:05:36.659> illumination<00:05:37.940> so

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
and the exterior illumination so

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.779
