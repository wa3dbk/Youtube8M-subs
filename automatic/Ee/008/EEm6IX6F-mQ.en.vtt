need<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:21.720> anyway<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.500> once<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.130> out<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
need to go anyway so once you get out of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.590 
need to go anyway so once you get out of
your<00:01:23.460> car<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
your car you just want to get into the

your car you just want to get into the
Buzzard<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> position<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> exactly<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.369> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
Buzzard and position it exactly like I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
Buzzard and position it exactly like I
do<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> side<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.750> dock<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.259> once<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
do on the side of the dock and once you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.960 
do on the side of the dock and once you
have<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> correctly<00:01:29.130> positioned<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
have it correctly positioned you just

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
have it correctly positioned you just

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
any more so once that happens you just

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.219 
any more so once that happens you just

whatever it is on ps3 to quick restart
it<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.270> should<00:02:12.300> end

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
it and it should end

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
you can just repeat the same method over

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.660 
you can just repeat the same method over
and<00:02:16.690> over<00:02:16.750> again<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.290> get<00:02:17.830> yourself<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.370> ton<00:02:18.640> of

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
and over again and get yourself a ton of

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.880 
and over again and get yourself a ton of
RP<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.170> said<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.470> beginning<00:02:20.620> of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
RP so like I said in the beginning of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.890 
RP so like I said in the beginning of
the<00:02:21.010> video<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.640> definitely<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.360> fastest

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
the video this is definitely the fastest

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.710 
the video this is definitely the fastest
way<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.110> level<00:02:23.380> up<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.280> are<00:02:24.430> I'd<00:02:24.880> say<00:02:25.090> under

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
way to level up if you are I'd say under

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.080 
way to level up if you are I'd say under
a<00:02:25.750> level<00:02:26.110> 200<00:02:26.739> but<00:02:27.099> if<00:02:27.220> you're<00:02:27.340> over<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.819> this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
a level 200 but if you're over that this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.690 
a level 200 but if you're over that this
is<00:02:28.270> gonna<00:02:28.480> probably<00:02:29.050> not<00:02:29.830> be<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.160> best<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.489> it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
is gonna probably not be the best but it

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.750 
is gonna probably not be the best but it
is<00:02:30.850> very<00:02:31.270> good<00:02:31.390> if<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.080> are<00:02:32.319> under<00:02:32.650> level<00:02:33.190> 200

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
is very good if you are under level 200

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.130 
is very good if you are under level 200
so<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.270> pretty<00:02:34.450> much<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:34.930> video

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
so that's pretty much it for this video

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.199 
so that's pretty much it for this video
I<00:02:35.530> hope<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:36.040> guys<00:02:36.130> did<00:02:36.400> enjoy<00:02:36.489> if<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.060> did
