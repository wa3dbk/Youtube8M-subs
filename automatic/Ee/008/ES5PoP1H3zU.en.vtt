00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.010
 these epic mountains together with this 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.810

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.570

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.360
 point 8.2 that always generated the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.460
 worlds well fine pretty but good 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.880
 walking because to grasp like this is 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.960
 a small village not like that not very big 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.030

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.680
 macro that minecraft 1.0 that's where 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.750
 the chests began to appear 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.040
 of the villas and they had like diamonds or 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.110

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.140

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.100
 party to sell me jeans put everything 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.750

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.930
 I paid a lot of attention here there is no no 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.330
 nothing but as they enter here and then 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.370
 then take this path as they can 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.090
 see here there is a good decoud down from 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.590

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.230
 disparagingly and good we continue 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.959
 walking towards the bottom is again 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.950

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.420

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.800

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.269
 this is where we're going to see the first this 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.040
 chest that is here to the bottom itself 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.480
 It does not have much but well I'm sure 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.970
 teaching if they need a bar 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.790
 of gold there and there is this coal and some 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.690
 how many seeds and well this is like 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.010
 it's like a pile of sand but good 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.720
 that we are going to fix rather is in 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.640
 this water and lava table that is there at 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.790
 background and just as we are seeing so 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.560

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.299

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.319
 business 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.630
 let's move forward to the bottom I'm going to 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.580
 try to do it as slow as possible 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.260
 so they do not fall down there they have 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.740
 what to see and have to arrive as is 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.920
 little puddle that is here there is a chaos 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.480
 two cobwebs and here you will find 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.090

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.170

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.640
 Redstone break and a little more iron 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.320
 but we still do not follow 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.970

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.489

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.680
