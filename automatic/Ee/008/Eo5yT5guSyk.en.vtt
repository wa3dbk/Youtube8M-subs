00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
is the star impact this is basically a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.920 
is the star impact this is basically a
Frankenstein<00:00:32.759> from<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> top<00:00:33.390> rope<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:35.930> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
Frankenstein from the top rope and I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.459 
Frankenstein from the top rope and I
didn't<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.300> didn't<00:00:39.300> take<00:00:39.450> much<00:00:39.809> time<00:00:40.140> doing

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
use it in the HW way um I had the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020 
use it in the HW way um I had the
algebra<00:01:00.690> breaker<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.579> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> her

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
algebra breaker and this is her

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
algebra breaker and this is her
basically<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> code<00:01:04.470> breaker<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> was

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
basically like a code breaker but it was

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.399 
basically like a code breaker but it was
for<00:01:05.869> one<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.340> main<00:01:08.340> characters<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.080> was

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
for one of my main characters and it was

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.980 
for one of my main characters and it was
kind<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> funny<00:01:11.189> character<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
kind of like a funny character for like

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.130 
kind of like a funny character for like
a<00:01:13.020> nerd<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.060> made<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.330> finisher<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:15.900> him

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
a nerd so I made this finisher for him

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.660 
a nerd so I made this finisher for him
not<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.710> effective<00:01:20.400> um<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> madness

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
not very effective um I have the madness

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.609 
not very effective um I have the madness
stun<00:01:24.500> starter<00:01:25.500> also<00:01:26.330> hey<00:01:27.330> hopefully<00:01:28.140> I'm

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
stun starter also hey hopefully I'm

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.149 
stun starter also hey hopefully I'm
hoping<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.970> will<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> finishers

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hoping this will be one of the finishers

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
hoping this will be one of the finishers
for<00:01:32.970> HW<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.079> well<00:01:34.520> Palin<00:01:35.520> won't<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.210> crazy

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
for HW as well Palin won't be this crazy

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
for HW as well Palin won't be this crazy
but<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:38.900> got<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> feeling<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> probably<00:01:41.040> will

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
but I got a feeling that I probably will

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
but I got a feeling that I probably will
use<00:01:41.970> something<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:47.689> next<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
use something like this next we have the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.130 
use something like this next we have the
shockwave<00:01:49.829> which<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:51.140> one

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
shockwave which is going to be also one

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.490 
shockwave which is going to be also one
of<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.290> finishers<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.720> not<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> whole

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of my finishers just not with the whole

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.080 
of my finishers just not with the whole
Argentine<00:01:56.189> clutch<00:01:56.990> but<00:01:57.990> i<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.700> using

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
Argentine clutch but i will be using

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.430 
Argentine clutch but i will be using
this<00:02:00.869> mature<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.860> th<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.370 

um<00:02:09.150> next<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.400> dead<00:02:12.760> air<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:14.200> is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
um next we have dead air and this is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.040 
um next we have dead air and this is
kind<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.740> like<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.190> slo-mo<00:02:16.030> feature<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.870> kind

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
kind of like a slo-mo feature it's kind

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.760 
kind of like a slo-mo feature it's kind
of<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.260> fallout<00:02:17.650> facebuster<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.660> slow<00:02:20.320> mo

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.740 

so<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.800> think<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.250> one's<00:02:24.580> pretty<00:02:24.790> cool<00:02:25.150> myself

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
so I think that one's pretty cool myself

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.720 
so I think that one's pretty cool myself
I<00:02:26.020> might<00:02:26.980> speed<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.000> up<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.660> little<00:02:28.900> bit

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
I might speed it up just a little bit

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.710 
I might speed it up just a little bit
but<00:02:31.020> for<00:02:32.020> now<00:02:32.170> I'm<00:02:32.410> keeping<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.370> in

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
but for now I'm keeping it like this in

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.480 
but for now I'm keeping it like this in
slow<00:02:34.720> mo<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:39.210> another<00:02:40.210> one<00:02:40.390> called<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
slow mo I have another one called the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.630 
slow mo I have another one called the
carnage<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.930> i<00:02:44.110> remember<00:02:44.410> right<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.310> one

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
carnage if i remember right this is one

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.130 
carnage if i remember right this is one
of<00:02:45.670> my<00:02:45.880> favorites<00:02:46.690> I'm<00:02:46.960> yeah<00:02:47.770> I'm<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.870> is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
of my favorites I'm yeah I'm this is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.320 
of my favorites I'm yeah I'm this is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
probably one of my favorite finishers on

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.760 
probably one of my favorite finishers on
here<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:54.730> created<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.810> really<00:02:56.380> like<00:02:56.560> this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
here that I created I really like this

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.200 
here that I created I really like this
finisher<00:02:57.370> um<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.860> basically<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.400> bite<00:03:00.730> into

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
finisher um it's basically a bite into

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.050 
finisher um it's basically a bite into

corner<00:03:52.330> move<00:03:53.280> hmm<00:03:54.280> it's<00:03:54.489> okay<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.540> didn't

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
corner move hmm it's okay but I didn't

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.949

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
spend too much time on it so it's not

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
one of the best ones but I still think

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.210 
one of the best ones but I still think
it<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.690> pretty<00:04:01.959> cool<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.720> it's<00:04:05.110> like<00:04:05.290> basically

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
it is pretty cool so it's like basically

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.009 
it is pretty cool so it's like basically
and<00:04:07.560> LU<00:04:08.560> bomb<00:04:09.070> from<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.790> top<00:04:10.030> load<00:04:10.330> in<00:04:10.570> 15
