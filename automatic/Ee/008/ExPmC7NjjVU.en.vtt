00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 Karben 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.299
 everyone else has gotten it you do not want anyone skipping ropes just john that 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.509
 is to have written a donation 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:26.199
 January have a similar name call him nominate the explosive device was on 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.960
 20th place and Senna and Alain Prost 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.759
 almost a quarter of the shares 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.530
 at 30 degrees 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.220
 Furthermore, even more starts canceled this value is divided into three parts 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.800
 consist 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.570
 firstly reported in the first part show firstly where once us-warheads comes 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.720
 Vitus sets correctly 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.810
 and thirdly we would be the springboard so that's the leap with that 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.240
 The beginning good side can be recognized by the fact that the stop provided over to dig 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.070
 and then the reason that patients are out of power based on trotting 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.460
 because what makes it suspiciously fast 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.130
 under eu diplomats 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.780
 it is forbidden to print and cheap, for example we are on site during 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.240
 The Solution Provider brought power cables or vegetables to Adventsachtacht and to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.330
 Jump all that seems to be in the East, the question and 7 May and probably 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.430
 that's why I really want to become a percent then I have spaces under that way 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.000
 Made where people get really good on Amazon is just worth it 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.280
 Spend a little more because of the tethering 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.510
 if other players are sold he is fine 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.920
 is exactly my foot 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.460
 on Twitter too 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.090
 so on the cooperation and then bow should see the conclusion 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.620
 less about it 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.750
 here will also get off 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 Obama followed quickly 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.810
 should finish at the top of the shoulder 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.130
 as a result, writes can recognize Blatter again 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.110
 The last word here is known only when it's too late 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.010
 be and have the whole in length 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.700
 Adjust percent fits 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.260
 Now you are with me 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.430
 if I insist on it now 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.310
 now it'll be okay to drive them as soldiers since Thursday runs 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.049
 better a party spokesman said that cut it off on pressure 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:11.840
 Bruce Willis 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.859
 but then you can do faster jumps 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.769
 but far away only the best 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.069
 at the top 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.730
 Before jumping in with the actual start it is very important of the biggest 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.359
 then I sat her already drawn shovel in front of frustration 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:29.699
 the top horse both were to take advantage of that has already become difficult 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.699
 Go swimming 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.359
 both sides are expected 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.479
 and also after the game percentage points 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.479
 the whole point is that he's right 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.239
 my friend René Préval 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.539
 get warm left 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.839
 very rare 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:58.329
 I have already been overwhelmed that I wait and wait 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.509
 avoid 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:00.299
 and then 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.940
 like Hans Krings so Europe showed banks 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.980
 the person 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.350
 just a leg forward and then francs and banks 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.909
 I do not have such a thing yet 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.659
 why my opinion 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.659
 of 14 throws the customers have 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.989
 may thank 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:33.539
 before the culprit was about 60 to 30 too, because one by one was right through 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.169
 Lengerich blasts the game badly 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.370
 if that does not come to you 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.309
 with shoes 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.559
 do you get every time clearing over the Persians a little slap on the 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.349
 Knees and on your spine 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.059
 while jump jumping rope 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.469
 where we always land only on the 4 and midfoot 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.869
 a calf and ankle will cushion your Kurkova body weight and you 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.879
 Do not have problems pressing the stock market 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.559
 the two hits succeeded 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:10.029
 I do not want that to be true what I say about it 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.639
 Wrists only slightly cloudy 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.249
 one more day had been shortened 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.249
 Keep things tidy 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.009
 to carry out the effort 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.639
 Wrists are now in the market athletic would be conceivable 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.060
 back down but do not want to use Baden wanted 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.379
 but it has become quite smooth 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.729
 It has been known for three years now that we are bursting the blow 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.740
 very intense the training 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.909
 how to make new ones always new ones must learn 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.719
 therefore it calls z 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.620
 I am not funny wisdom 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.970
 but something completely different than always just to jogging or crosstrainer or doing 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.669
 one of both 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.080
 and the coach 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.539
 henceforth it will be 2 times 10 minutes 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.639
 per week 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.339
 and if so you save from intervals 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.370
 Just do it in the beginning 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.559
 really just this that something happens quite loose to explosive power 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.389
 and then you could try 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.939
 in May had to come to 30 seconds 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.740
 Prof 30 zones cut should be your initial goal 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.100
 It says the accounts of one minute break 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.100
 and then the whole thing repeated up to a third instead 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.309
 I forgot something 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:33.809
 »Continue with the second video next week 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:34.919
 Add 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.289
 first needed and the skipping rope 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.580
 if Church just did that 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.599
 Roche will certainly see us next week for the second part 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.949
 to be saved over time 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.449
 "My poor Feuerbacher and who represented himself
