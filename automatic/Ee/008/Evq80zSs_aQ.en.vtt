00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.500
 good morning evenings friends nights 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.560
 youtuber os this time I bring you 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.230
 the subject of adipose tissue well 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.680
 let's start 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.109
 generalities specialized variety of 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.500
 a connective tissue constituted by 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.150
 adipocytes or adipose cells 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.270
 characterized to store fats or 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.370
 lipids the adipose tissue is integrated 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.870
 by joining reticular fibers 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.879
 of adipocytes type 3 and is and between 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.670
 the latter circulated an abundant 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:52.120
 blood supply adipocytes 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.730
 they form when they join lobules and these to their 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:00.260
 they give rise to the adipose lobes 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.690
 functions models the body surface 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 form cushion pads 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 maintains body temperature since 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.710
 it is a fabric with bad driving 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.160
 Heat occupies the spaces between 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.050
 tissues and organs which 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.810
 he keeps in his position 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.110
 It is the main reservoir of energy 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 chemistry 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:31.460
 Adipose tissue classification tissue 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.000
 like a white or yellow and brown fabric 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.340
 it differs from one another by the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.400
 the morphological properties of their 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.909
 cells the color in its fresh state 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.030
 vascularization innervation localization 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.619
 and functions they perform 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.780
 adipose tissue like a white or yellow 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.060
 it is also known as an eye thread 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 because the lipids are stored in the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.580
 inside the cells in the form of a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.880
 large cytoplasmic droplet the color of the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.250
 fat is white or yellowish depends on 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.890
 the diet that individual ingests for that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.390
 shows a yellow color if the food 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.489
 Ingested contains amounts 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.489
 significant carotene 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.660
 and here is a histological image 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.660
 of adipose tissue 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.480
 I also observed 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.630
 the brown adipose tissue or brown fat 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.990
 It gets its name because of the color that goes 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.150
 from golden yellow to brown 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.090
 reddish that exhibits its being 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.210
 its cells the tonality is due to the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.160
 important number of chromos successes 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.940
 contained in the numerous mitochondria 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.120
 of adipocytes is also known as 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.250
 adipose tissue multi ocular since 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.980
 the cells store the lipids in 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.420
 form of small distributed vesicles 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.940
 in a regular way throughout the cytoplasm 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.800
 the brown fat cells are from 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.099
 smaller size compared to those of fat 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.250
 white usually measure between 30 and 40 microns 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.760
 in diameter usually have shape 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.440
 polyhedral and an oval core 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.690
 slightly eccentric surrounded by 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.720
 abundant cytoplasm where 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.450
 locate numerous lipid droplets 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
 of different sizes 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.129
 and the cytoplasm contains a large 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.739
 amount of spherical mitochondria with 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.739
 long tubular crests 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.170
 they observe themselves many cisterns 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.659
 of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.989
 appreciable amounts of granules of 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.299
 glycogen a high proportion of 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.150
 blood capillaries and terminations 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.730
 nerve tissue crosses the adipose tissue 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.409
 cells form the bobbin attached by 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.409
 fine connective tissue 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.170
 and this is the difference is another image 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.170
 histological but these brown fat 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.490
 and you can clearly see the 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.600
 difference 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.600
 between the tissues 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.000
 unlike white fat the 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.739
 brown adipose tissue has a 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.710
 very restricted distribution in the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.260
 pieces in the human species in fetuses and 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.680
 newborns spots are located 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.410
 determined in adults the fat 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.990
 brown is non-existent in other species 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.290
 animals like certain rodents and 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.260
 animals that hibernate this type of fat 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.810
 they persist in the adult stage 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.830
 the location of brown adipose tissue 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.440
 is limited to interscapular regions 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.540
 ventral inguinal pelvic neck peri 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.930
 renal and around the glands 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.930
 adrenal 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.460
 well that will be all on my part about 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:04.430
 Adipose tissue thanks 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.620
 remember to subscribe to like and 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.870
 share it if it was helpful 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.099
 I am doctor ruiz see you in the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.099
 next thanks
