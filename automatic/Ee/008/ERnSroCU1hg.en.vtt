00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:26.530
 on the server my game is very interesting 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.699
 because 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:01:32.900
 that's why I want to play like that 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:38.270
 like most but you can see 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.720
 here is a small parkour yes what are you 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.790
 This card is really strong 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.790
 in general, a lot of parkour answer them 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:04:45.960
 from above and want to go down the threshold 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:25.440
 my kill him strong at the moment i 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.440
 not just talking for this card is populated 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:37.410
 trouble forgive me please one 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.090
 the man died and the green man remained 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:46.530
 we hope that I will succeed Lazarev so 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.530
 say you can't kill 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.580
 by glory 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.220
 general store 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.670
 not 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:50.570
 she had a picture 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.230
 you start but still I have no chance 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.230
 it was under a lot 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.230
 but it turned out quite interesting
