lodge 3 from our trio collection but

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.500 
lodge 3 from our trio collection but
what<00:00:12.980> I<00:00:13.010> show<00:00:13.250> you<00:00:13.280> also<00:00:13.940> applies<00:00:14.180> for<00:00:14.210> the

what I show you also applies for the
lodge<00:00:14.660> 2

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.490 

once<00:00:32.699> you've<00:00:32.850> chosen<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.359> location<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:34.109> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
once you've chosen the location for the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770 
once you've chosen the location for the
enter<00:00:34.739> 10<00:00:34.949> all<00:00:35.129> we<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.519> do<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.910> take<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
enter 10 all we have to do is take the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200 
enter 10 all we have to do is take the
poles<00:00:37.019> and<00:00:37.260> assemble<00:00:37.920> them<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:39.000> made<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
poles and assemble them this has made it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.590 
poles and assemble them this has made it
very<00:00:39.300> easy<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.129> poles<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.390> our

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
very easy because the poles here our

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
very easy because the poles here our
shock<00:00:43.350> corded<00:00:43.680> from<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.039> side<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> other

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
shock corded from one side to the other

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340 
shock corded from one side to the other
so<00:00:45.089> it<00:00:45.149> doesn't<00:00:45.359> make<00:00:45.449> them<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.719> simple<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so it doesn't make them very simple to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.380 
so it doesn't make them very simple to
pick<00:00:46.469> together

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
pick together

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.610 
pick together
once<00:00:48.390> you've<00:00:48.540> assembled<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.049> poles<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
once you've assembled the poles all you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
once you've assembled the poles all you
need<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.699> sit<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.329> Center

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
need to do is just sit the Center

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.630 
need to do is just sit the Center
hanging<00:00:52.079> point<00:00:52.289> facedown<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> middle<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
hanging point facedown in the middle and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.750 
hanging point facedown in the middle and
then<00:00:54.180> attach<00:00:54.690> each<00:00:55.320> pole<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.190> plastic

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
then attach each pole to the plastic

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:12.640 
then attach each pole to the plastic
cups<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.299> corners

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.030 

once<00:01:12.980> the<00:01:13.250> four<00:01:13.850> corners<00:01:14.420> are<00:01:14.570> placed<00:01:15.020> all<00:01:15.890> we

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
once the four corners are placed all we

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.340 
once the four corners are placed all we
need<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.220> do<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.580> locate<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.140> hanging<00:01:18.140> point

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
need to do is locate the hanging point

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.030 
need to do is locate the hanging point
on<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.950> flesh<00:01:19.160> on<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.910> inner<00:01:20.330> tent<00:01:20.540> here<00:01:21.040> and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
on the flesh on the inner tent here and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.890 
on the flesh on the inner tent here and
then<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:22.730> just<00:01:22.910> simply<00:01:23.180> lift<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.480> up<00:01:23.660> into

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
then we just simply lift that up into

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.830 
then we just simply lift that up into
place<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.620> connect<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.550> hand<00:01:26.510> point<00:01:26.690> at

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
place and connect it to hand point at

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.280 
place and connect it to hand point at
the<00:01:26.960> top<00:01:28.000> then<00:01:29.000> all<00:01:29.150> we<00:01:29.210> need<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.390> do<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:30.050> just

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
the top then all we need to do is just

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.410 
the top then all we need to do is just
start<00:01:30.560> clipping<00:01:30.830> all<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.790> way<00:01:31.910> around<00:01:32.150> each

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
start clipping all the way around each

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.070 
start clipping all the way around each
pole<00:01:33.820> next<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:34.970> simply<00:01:35.240> need<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.450> unfold<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
pole next we simply need to unfold the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.140 
pole next we simply need to unfold the
flysheet<00:01:36.290> slide<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.340> over<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.520> top<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:37.790> then

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
flysheet slide it over the top and then

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.760 
flysheet slide it over the top and then
attach<00:01:38.510> it<00:01:38.690> at<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.900> four<00:01:39.110> points

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.890 

before<00:01:47.729> connecting<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.150> four<00:01:48.420> corners<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
before connecting the four corners of

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.289 
before connecting the four corners of
the<00:01:49.290> fly<00:01:49.470> sheet<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.950> inner<00:01:50.280> tent<00:01:50.580> just<00:01:50.790> be

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the fly sheet to the inner tent just be

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.500 
the fly sheet to the inner tent just be

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:14.090 
poles just to make sure that the fly
sheet<00:01:56.100> lanes<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.520> correctly

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.680 

once<00:02:15.100> you've<00:02:15.250> connected<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.940> four<00:02:16.300> corners

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
once you've connected the four corners

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.390 
once you've connected the four corners
of<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.900> flysheet<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> inner<00:02:17.740> tent<00:02:17.980> the

of the flysheet to the inner tent the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.860 
of the flysheet to the inner tent the
last<00:02:18.580> thing<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.850> do<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.330> pop<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.290 

next<00:02:29.440> thing<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.680> do<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.640> peg<00:02:30.850> down<00:02:31.030> all

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300

the pagan points around the tent we'll
start<00:02:33.490> on<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.640> four<00:02:33.880> corners<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.330> then<00:02:34.630> we'll

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
start on the four corners and then we'll

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:52.020 
start on the four corners and then we'll
position<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.260> porches<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:35.920> peg<00:02:36.100> them<00:02:36.280> out<00:02:36.430> to
