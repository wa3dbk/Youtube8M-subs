00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
gun and I did what I had to do basically

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.690 
gun and I did what I had to do basically
the<00:01:10.080> only<00:01:10.260> thing<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.680> unlocked<00:01:11.040> while<00:01:11.280> doing<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the only thing I unlocked while doing it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
the only thing I unlocked while doing it
was<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> sg553<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.770> unlike<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.600> g3<00:01:15.979> now

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
was the sg553 anything unlike the g3 now

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130 
was the sg553 anything unlike the g3 now
the<00:01:17.610> g3<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.060> lot<00:01:18.240> stronger<00:01:18.479> does<00:01:18.810> 30<00:01:19.049> damage

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the g3 is a lot stronger does 30 damage

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.249 
the g3 is a lot stronger does 30 damage
but<00:01:19.650> we're<00:01:20.040> talking<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> sg553

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
but we're talking about the sg553

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.480 
but we're talking about the sg553
overall<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> pretty<00:01:22.890> decent<00:01:23.340> gun

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
overall I think it's a pretty decent gun

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
overall I think it's a pretty decent gun
myself<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> used<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> first

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
myself on you know I used it the first

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
myself on you know I used it the first
time<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.009> used<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> first<00:01:26.790> couple<00:01:26.970> times<00:01:27.210> I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
time I used in the first couple times I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.679 
time I used in the first couple times I
used<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.960> though<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
used it if though as if it was kind of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.179 
used it if though as if it was kind of
weak<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.409> don't<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.100> my

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
weak I don't know if it was just my

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.200 
weak I don't know if it was just my
connection<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.880> haven't<00:01:33.030> been

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
connection because I haven't been

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.990 
connection because I haven't been
getting<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:33.930> connection<00:01:34.200> lately<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.000> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
getting a good connection lately but it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.810 
getting a good connection lately but it
felt<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> weak<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.229> duh<00:01:37.820> it's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
felt kind of weak but what duh it's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.700 
felt kind of weak but what duh it's
really<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.500> just

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
really not we get all I think it's just

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
really not we get all I think it's just
because<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:41.070> connection<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.790> gun

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
because of my connection but this gun

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
connection but or what it was or maybe

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.490 
connection but or what it was or maybe
it<00:03:13.209> was<00:03:13.239> just<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.510> map<00:03:13.720> maybe<00:03:13.930> I'm<00:03:14.109> having<00:03:14.230> some

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it was just a map maybe I'm having some

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.039 
it was just a map maybe I'm having some
lag<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.280> wasn't<00:03:15.579> getting<00:03:15.909> you<00:03:16.690> know<00:03:16.810> hit

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
lag but I wasn't getting you know hit

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.599 
lag but I wasn't getting you know hit
markers<00:03:17.380> i<00:03:17.470> wasn't<00:03:17.799> getting<00:03:17.859> shots<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.519> was

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
markers i wasn't getting shots but I was

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.069 
markers i wasn't getting shots but I was
like<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.880> was<00:03:19.060> kind<00:03:19.359> of<00:03:19.419> good<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:20.019> know

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
like this was kind of good you know

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.020 
like this was kind of good you know
that's<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.410> really<00:03:20.829> long<00:03:21.010> range<00:03:21.280> shot<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.970> I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
that's a really long range shot and I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.370 
that's a really long range shot and I
was<00:03:22.120> trying<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.329> take<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.630> some<00:03:22.660> snipers<00:03:23.230> I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
was trying to take on some snipers I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.440 
was trying to take on some snipers I
almost<00:03:23.650> died<00:03:23.889> trying<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.280> do<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.669> but<00:03:24.940> um<00:03:25.180> I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
almost died trying to do so but um I

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.039 
almost died trying to do so but um I
think<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.930> did<00:03:26.109> that<00:03:26.290> once<00:03:26.709> or<00:03:26.859> something<00:03:26.980> but

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
think I did that once or something but

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.270 
think I did that once or something but
anyways<00:03:29.049> it's<00:03:29.230> perfect<00:03:29.620> for<00:03:29.650> all<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.160> know

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
anyways it's perfect for all you know

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.099 
anyways it's perfect for all you know
hitting<00:03:30.519> those<00:03:30.669> snipers<00:03:30.910> because<00:03:31.510> if<00:03:31.930> you

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
hitting those snipers because if you

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.629 
hitting those snipers because if you
catch<00:03:32.260> them<00:03:32.410> off<00:03:32.560> guard<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.220> basically

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
catch them off guard you have basically

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.129 
catch them off guard you have basically
almost<00:03:33.910> no<00:03:34.180> recoil<00:03:34.569> especially<00:03:34.989> if<00:03:35.049> you

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
almost no recoil especially if you

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.520 
almost no recoil especially if you
attach<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.560> grip<00:03:35.919> on<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:37.150> really<00:03:37.900> does<00:03:38.139> help<00:03:38.379> a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
attach the grip on it really does help a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.699 
attach the grip on it really does help a
lot<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.639> sg553<00:03:40.419> it<00:03:40.810> has<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> record<00:03:41.530> that's

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
lot and the sg553 it has a record that's

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.129 
lot and the sg553 it has a record that's
up<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.579> right<00:03:42.699> so<00:03:43.449> if<00:03:43.569> you<00:03:43.660> could<00:03:43.870> kind

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
up and to the right so if you could kind

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.599 
up and to the right so if you could kind
of<00:03:44.199> adjust<00:03:44.680> when<00:03:44.919> you're<00:03:45.040> shooting<00:03:45.250> I'm

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
of adjust when you're shooting I'm

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.339 
of adjust when you're shooting I'm
remember<00:03:46.389> always<00:03:46.599> remember<00:03:47.049> it's<00:03:47.169> going<00:03:47.290> to

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
remember always remember it's going to

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.860 
remember always remember it's going to
go<00:03:47.470> up<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.919> to<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.069> right<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.639> you<00:03:49.629> know<00:03:49.660> if

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
go up and to the right and you know if

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.150 
go up and to the right and you know if
you're<00:03:49.959> using<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.319> red<00:03:50.500> dot<00:03:50.709> you<00:03:50.859> can<00:03:51.010> see<00:03:51.129> a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
you're using the red dot you can see a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.710 
you're using the red dot you can see a
lot<00:03:51.430> easier<00:03:51.639> like<00:03:52.000> I'm<00:03:52.120> using<00:03:52.299> right<00:03:52.510> here<00:03:52.690> i

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
lot easier like I'm using right here i

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.569 
lot easier like I'm using right here i
think<00:03:52.959> i<00:03:53.019> just<00:03:53.049> unlocked<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.709> holographic

think i just unlocked the holographic

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.610 
think i just unlocked the holographic
sight<00:03:54.910> but<00:03:55.000> i<00:03:55.060> haven't<00:03:55.329> used<00:03:55.449> a<00:03:55.620> holographic

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
sight but i haven't used a holographic

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.500 
sight but i haven't used a holographic
sight<00:03:56.919> yet<00:03:57.160> but<00:03:57.699> the<00:03:57.790> red<00:03:57.940> dot<00:03:58.120> you'll<00:03:58.299> see<00:03:58.480> a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
sight yet but the red dot you'll see a

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.330 
sight yet but the red dot you'll see a
lot<00:03:58.720> more<00:03:58.780> because<00:03:59.410> he's<00:03:59.620> going<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.829> go<00:03:59.949> up<00:04:00.190> and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340
