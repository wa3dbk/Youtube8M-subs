00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
version of HTC One and we're going to do

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.620 
version of HTC One and we're going to do
the<00:00:08.099> gaming<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.610> benchmarking<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.480> this

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
the gaming and benchmarking in this

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.480 
the gaming and benchmarking in this
video<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.710> here<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.070> have<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> beautiful

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
video so here we have the beautiful

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.660 
video so here we have the beautiful
looking<00:00:12.000> HTC<00:00:12.480> One<00:00:12.690> mini<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.740> first<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.250> will<00:00:14.519> do

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
looking HTC One mini and first I will do

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.430 
looking HTC One mini and first I will do
the<00:00:14.790> benchmarking<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.450> then<00:00:15.660> move<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.049> gaming

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the benchmarking and then move to gaming

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.290 
the benchmarking and then move to gaming
from<00:00:16.740> casual<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.190> heavy<00:00:17.460> games<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.970> I've

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
from casual to heavy games and I've

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.870 
from casual to heavy games and I've
already<00:00:18.510> done<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.020> benchmarking<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.100> before

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
already done the benchmarking and before

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.859 
already done the benchmarking and before
that<00:00:20.910> let<00:00:21.210> me<00:00:21.240> show<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> configuration

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that let me show you the configuration

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.710 
that let me show you the configuration
using<00:00:22.560> CPU<00:00:22.890> set<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.570> it's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
using CPU set and as you can see it's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.410 
using CPU set and as you can see it's
based<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.380> Snapdragon<00:00:26.160> s4<00:00:26.420> hundred

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
based on the Snapdragon s4 hundred

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.419 
based on the Snapdragon s4 hundred
chipset<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.560> dual-core<00:00:28.920> processor

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
chipset and it's a dual-core processor

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.120 
chipset and it's a dual-core processor
clocked<00:00:30.060> at<00:00:30.210> 1.4<00:00:31.019> gigahertz<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.949> see

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
clocked at 1.4 gigahertz as you can see

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.959 
clocked at 1.4 gigahertz as you can see
and<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.000> GP<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> Adreno<00:00:34.170> 3:05<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and the GP on this is Adreno 3:05 the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
and the GP on this is Adreno 3:05 the
RAM<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.710> gets<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
RAM on this one as one gets and the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729 
RAM on this one as one gets and the
panel<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> 720p<00:00:39.270> panel<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.230> that's<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
panel is a 720p panel so that's for the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
panel is a 720p panel so that's for the
configuration<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:42.210> already<00:00:42.360> done

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
configuration I have already done

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
configuration I have already done
benchmarks<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> popular<00:00:44.100> benchmarks<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
benchmarks for the popular benchmarks so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.490 
benchmarks for the popular benchmarks so
I'll<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.390> show<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.899> goes<00:00:46.170> directly

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
I'll just show you this goes directly

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.760 
I'll just show you this goes directly
and<00:00:47.329> first<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> quadrant<00:00:49.140> score<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and first this is the quadrant score and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.060 
and first this is the quadrant score and
we<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> score<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:51.199> 5824<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> quadrant

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
we got a score of 5824 and the quadrant

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
we got a score of 5824 and the quadrant
which<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> decent<00:00:54.270> score<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> dual-core

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
which is a decent score for a dual-core

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
which is a decent score for a dual-core
processor<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.090> this<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> antutu

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
processor and this is the antutu

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.270 
processor and this is the antutu
benchmark<00:00:57.780> scores<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> score<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
benchmark scores we got a score of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.580 
benchmark scores we got a score of
15,000<00:01:00.030> 36<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.960> would<00:01:01.109> say<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
15,000 36 and I would say that's a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130 
15,000 36 and I would say that's a
pretty<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.460> score<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.760> an<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.570> benchmark

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
pretty good score for an to do benchmark

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.250 
pretty good score for an to do benchmark
and<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> epic<00:01:06.240> sagittal<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.869> ran<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and this is the epic sagittal I ran it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.620 
and this is the epic sagittal I ran it
three<00:01:07.740> times<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.549> first<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.420> high

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
three times the first one is in high

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.420 
three times the first one is in high
performance<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.799> go<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> score<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
performance and here we go to score of

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.780 
performance and here we go to score of
58<00:01:11.820> point<00:01:12.210> 1<00:01:12.420> fps<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.979> ran<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.549> high

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
58 point 1 fps I also ran it at high

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.530 
58 point 1 fps I also ran it at high
quality<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.630> dip<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.280> 56.9<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.580> finally<00:01:18.479> an

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
quality and a dip to 56.9 and finally an

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
quality and a dip to 56.9 and finally an
ultra<00:01:18.869> high<00:01:19.020> quality<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.619> goes<00:01:19.920> down<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
ultra high quality it goes down to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.330 
ultra high quality it goes down to
thirty<00:01:20.580> point<00:01:20.909> six<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.170> GPU<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.860> said<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
thirty point six the GPU as I said as I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
thirty point six the GPU as I said as I
three<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.790> 3:05<00:01:24.450> which<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.750> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
three know 3:05 which is kind of a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830 
three know 3:05 which is kind of a
mid-range<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.950> GPU<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> we'll<00:01:27.360> start<00:01:27.659> with

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
mid-range a GPU and we'll start with

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.050 
mid-range a GPU and we'll start with
some<00:01:28.049> casual<00:01:28.470> games<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.950> sub<00:01:29.280> laser<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.850> now

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.789 

and<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> screen<00:01:33.509> quality<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.650> very

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and the screen quality is actually very

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
and the screen quality is actually very
good<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> viewing<00:01:36.689> angles<00:01:37.020> are

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
good if you see the viewing angles are

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.219 
good if you see the viewing angles are
actually<00:01:37.500> pretty<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.150> one

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.649 

and<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.369> subway<00:01:45.759> surfer<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.210> not<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.390> very

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
and the subway surfer is not a very

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.160 
and the subway surfer is not a very
resource-intensive<00:01:47.140> game<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:49.930> some<00:01:50.140> of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
resource-intensive game but in some of

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.050 
resource-intensive game but in some of
the<00:01:50.350> handset<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.950> exhibits<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.640> little<00:01:51.880> bit<00:01:51.969> of

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
the handset it exhibits a little bit of

land and here also in the HTC One mini I

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.679 
land and here also in the HTC One mini I
did<00:01:56.229> notice<00:01:56.469> a<00:01:56.829> little<00:01:57.130> bit<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.340> lag<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.969> the

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
did notice a little bit of lag and the

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.809 
did notice a little bit of lag and the
advanced<00:01:59.079> levels<00:01:59.590> it's<00:02:00.250> not<00:02:00.460> like<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
advanced levels it's not like the

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.980 
advanced levels it's not like the
largest<00:02:01.149> present<00:02:01.720> every<00:02:02.170> time<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.990> pops

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
largest present every time but it pops

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.210 
largest present every time but it pops
in<00:02:05.340> sometimes<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:08.170> for<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.410> most<00:02:08.679> part<00:02:09.009> I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
in sometimes but for the most part I

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.479 
in sometimes but for the most part I
would<00:02:09.369> say<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:10.599> runs<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.170> service<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:12.540> fine

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.589 
and that was simply not available
for<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:17.500> device<00:04:17.829> and<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.639> would<00:04:18.760> aspect<00:04:19.090> it

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
for this device and you would aspect it

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.159 
for this device and you would aspect it
was<00:04:19.989> not<00:04:20.799> available<00:04:21.370> hence<00:04:22.270> I've<00:04:22.930> downloaded

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
was not available hence I've downloaded

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.760 
was not available hence I've downloaded
the<00:04:23.530> asphalt<00:04:24.099> 7<00:04:26.610> also<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:28.030> wanted<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.630> test<00:04:28.870> Need

for<00:04:29.800> Speed<00:04:30.039> Most<00:04:30.430> Wanted<00:04:31.740> but<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.950> was<00:04:33.130> also

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
for Speed Most Wanted but that was also

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.029

latest games are simply not very work

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.140 
latest games are simply not very work

and we got to play this popular a wide

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:15.650 
and we got to play this popular a wide
level<00:05:05.900> for<00:05:06.890> this<00:05:07.010> asphalt<00:05:07.280> seven

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.969 

and<00:05:16.660> as<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:16.900> can<00:05:17.020> see<00:05:17.169> for<00:05:17.319> the<00:05:17.410> most<00:05:17.440> part

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
and as you can see for the most part

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:35.680 
and as you can see for the most part
it's<00:05:18.520> running<00:05:18.879> it<00:05:19.000> fine<00:05:19.629> without<00:05:20.050> any<00:05:20.259> issues

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:06:03.189 

it's<00:05:36.200> a<00:05:36.560> vignette

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.409 

so<00:06:03.710> as<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:03.979> can<00:06:04.099> see<00:06:04.159> if<00:06:04.460> monsters<00:06:05.210> are

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
so as you can see if monsters are

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.200 
so as you can see if monsters are
spanned<00:06:05.779> seven<00:06:06.669> actually<00:06:07.669> it's<00:06:07.789> running<00:06:08.090> at

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
spanned seven actually it's running at

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:21.439 
spanned seven actually it's running at
the<00:06:08.479> print<00:06:08.810> I<00:06:09.020> now<00:06:09.080> say

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.869 

but<00:06:22.139> the<00:06:22.289> smoke<00:06:22.590> effects<00:06:23.009> from<00:06:23.129> the<00:06:23.279> tire<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.849> a

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
but the smoke effects from the tire is a

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:33.720 
but the smoke effects from the tire is a
little<00:06:24.270> bit<00:06:24.389> subdued

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.460 

so<00:06:34.210> as<00:06:34.360> you<00:06:34.480> can<00:06:34.630> see<00:06:34.780> you<00:06:34.960> will<00:06:35.020> have<00:06:35.080> a<00:06:35.230> good
