difficulty and chill Billy with tits go

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.330 
difficulty and chill Billy with tits go
ahead<00:00:15.990> get<00:00:16.619> over<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.039> we're<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
ahead get over here and we're going to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.769 
ahead get over here and we're going to
start<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.880> Saudi<00:00:18.240> Arabia<00:00:19.310> press<00:00:20.310> Start<00:00:21.240> hit

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
start it in Saudi Arabia press Start hit

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.259 
start it in Saudi Arabia press Start hit
the<00:00:21.960> first<00:00:22.260> bubble<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.740> speed<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.400> up<00:00:26.609> alright

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the first bubble and speed it up alright

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.870 
the first bubble and speed it up alright
so<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.480> virus<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.349> means<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> randomly

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
so a virus this means that it randomly

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.479 
so a virus this means that it randomly
mutates<00:00:30.740> rapidly<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.250> hard<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
mutates rapidly and can be hard to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.850 
mutates rapidly and can be hard to
control<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.059> costs<00:00:33.329> day/night<00:00:33.690> points<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
control it costs day/night points to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.340 
control it costs day/night points to
devolve<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.030> we're<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> avoid<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.989> by

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
devolve so we're going to avoid that by

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:53.479 
devolve so we're going to avoid that by
allowing<00:00:37.920> symptoms<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.210> made

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.010 

we're<00:00:53.940> doing<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.629> different

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
we're doing it a little bit different

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.479 
we're doing it a little bit different
this<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:56.870> we<00:00:57.870> want<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> devolve<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.040> deadly

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this time we want to devolve the deadly

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.299 
this time we want to devolve the deadly
ones<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.050> thing<00:01:01.949> since<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.579> gets<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:03.329> of

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
ones but the thing since it gets kind of

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.649 
ones but the thing since it gets kind of
discovered<00:01:05.309> anyway<00:01:05.700> we're<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.509> go
