for<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> long<00:00:21.990> time<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.920> hard<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.850> find

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

something<00:00:24.480> better<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.890> also<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.369> hard<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
something better it's also very hard to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
something better it's also very hard to
think<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.289> way<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.619> incorporate<00:00:29.070> that

have been a very hard thing to develop
yes<00:00:53.250> how<00:00:53.850> many<00:00:53.910> years<00:00:54.360> did<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.600> spend<00:00:54.989> two

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
yes how many years did you spend two

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.990 
yes how many years did you spend two
years<00:00:55.530> two<00:00:55.949> years<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.379> split<00:00:58.739> image

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
years two years just on the split image

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.869 
years two years just on the split image
focusing<00:01:00.000> system<00:01:00.149> Wow<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> exactly<00:01:02.609> how<00:01:02.730> does

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
focusing system Wow so exactly how does

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.109 
focusing system Wow so exactly how does
the<00:01:03.449> digital<00:01:03.899> split<00:01:04.409> image<00:01:04.619> focus<00:01:05.250> operate<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the digital split image focus operate on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.039 
the digital split image focus operate on
a<00:01:06.180> user<00:01:06.500> level<00:01:07.939> well<00:01:08.939> unlike<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.510> old<00:01:09.659> SLR

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
a user level well unlike the old SLR

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
a user level well unlike the old SLR
where<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> had<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:10.979> semicircles<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
where you had two semicircles that you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.770 
where you had two semicircles that you
would<00:01:12.630> line<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:14.220> XE<00:01:14.640> -<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.600> actually

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
would line up on the XE - you actually

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.749 
would line up on the XE - you actually
have<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.290> rectangle<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> middle<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.610> the

have a rectangle in the middle of the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.810 
have a rectangle in the middle of the
screen<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> eyepiece<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:20.549> four

screen or the eyepiece that has four

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.710 
screen or the eyepiece that has four
layers<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
layers to it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.740 
layers to it
when<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.740> line<00:01:22.950> those<00:01:23.189> four<00:01:23.549> layers<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:24.030> it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
when you line those four layers up it's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.160 
when you line those four layers up it's
fairly<00:01:25.020> simple<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:27.170> subject

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
fairly simple to see that your subject

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.580 
fairly simple to see that your subject
is<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.530> focus<00:01:29.630> now<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.960> actually<00:01:31.350> keep

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
is in focus now you can actually keep

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.109 
is in focus now you can actually keep
that<00:01:31.770> rectangle<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> middle<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that rectangle in the middle of the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.660 
that rectangle in the middle of the
screen<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.229> viewfinder<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.520> can

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
screen or the viewfinder or you can

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.450 
screen or the viewfinder or you can
actually<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.170> fullscreen<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
actually make that fullscreen so the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.910 
actually make that fullscreen so the
whole<00:01:38.640> screen<00:01:39.060> becomes<00:01:39.630> digital<00:01:40.200> split<00:01:40.710> image

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
whole screen becomes digital split image

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039 
whole screen becomes digital split image
viewfinder<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.970> those<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.360> difficult<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
viewfinder for those more difficult to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.560 
viewfinder for those more difficult to
focus<00:01:43.229> subjects

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:02:25.770 

I<00:02:22.709> believe<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:24.040> actually<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.720> very

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
I believe it actually it's it's very

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.550 
I believe it actually it's it's very
different<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:27.090> x100s<00:02:28.090> system<00:02:28.780> because<00:02:29.320> on

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
different to the x100s system because on

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.520 
different to the x100s system because on
this<00:02:30.160> camera<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> exit<00:02:31.000> -<00:02:31.320> you've<00:02:32.320> actually

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
this camera the exit - you've actually

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.640 
this camera the exit - you've actually
had<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.370> make<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.120> work<00:02:34.330> with<00:02:34.570> all<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.020> the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
that incorporates both hardware the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.680 
that incorporates both hardware the
145,000<00:03:30.460> phase<00:03:30.700> detection<00:03:31.120> pixels

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
145,000 phase detection pixels

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.810 
145,000 phase detection pixels
incorporated<00:03:32.470> into<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.800> surface<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
incorporated into the surface of the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.440 
incorporated into the surface of the
amazing<00:03:34.570> x-trans<00:03:34.990> CMOS<00:03:35.410> sensor<00:03:35.800> and<00:03:36.450> software

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
amazing x-trans CMOS sensor and software

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.810 
amazing x-trans CMOS sensor and software
as<00:03:37.660> well<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.350> there<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.710> it<00:03:39.370> was<00:03:39.580> very

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
as well so there is it was very

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.360 
as well so there is it was very
difficult<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:40.480> Tom<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.990> write<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.470> program<00:03:41.890> that

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
difficult to Tom to write a program that

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.520 
difficult to Tom to write a program that
could<00:03:42.520> not<00:03:42.910> only<00:03:43.060> do<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.480> but<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:43.960> it<00:03:44.080> in<00:03:44.230> real

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
could not only do this but do it in real

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.580 
could not only do this but do it in real
time<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.340> do<00:03:46.210> it<00:03:46.240> for<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:47.290> many<00:03:47.350> different

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
time and do it for so many different

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.610 
time and do it for so many different
lenses<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.520> if<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.120> think<00:03:49.390> about<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:49.810> this

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
lenses and if you think about it this

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620 
lenses and if you think about it this
program<00:03:51.070> has<00:03:51.220> had<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.520> be<00:03:51.550> written<00:03:51.940> for<00:03:52.120> lenses

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
program has had to be written for lenses

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.080 
program has had to be written for lenses
that<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.930> doesn't<00:03:53.260> even<00:03:53.350> know<00:03:53.590> about<00:03:53.740> and<00:03:54.160> that

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
that it doesn't even know about and that

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.410 
that it doesn't even know about and that
is<00:03:55.480> something<00:03:56.550> it's<00:03:57.550> just<00:03:57.850> too<00:03:58.000> difficult<00:03:58.120> to

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
is something it's just too difficult to

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.230 
is something it's just too difficult to
think<00:03:58.570> of<00:03:58.780> for<00:03:59.020> me<00:03:59.520> I'll<00:04:00.520> leave<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:00.820> to

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
think of for me I'll leave that to

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.260 
think of for me I'll leave that to
geniuses<00:04:02.020> like<00:04:02.260> Tom<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:05.310> think<00:04:06.310> you've

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
geniuses like Tom so I think you've

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.670 
geniuses like Tom so I think you've
really<00:04:07.480> got<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.750> appreciate<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.440> technology
