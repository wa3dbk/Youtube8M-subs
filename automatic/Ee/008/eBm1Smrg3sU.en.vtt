00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
only positive things I think the best

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.990 
only positive things I think the best
thing<00:03:10.500> about<00:03:10.740> being<00:03:10.920> here<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.700> fact<00:03:11.910> that

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
thing about being here is the fact that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.940 
thing about being here is the fact that
we<00:03:12.150> get<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.360> dance<00:03:12.690> all<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.080> time<00:03:13.290> every<00:03:13.710> day

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
we get to dance all the time every day

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.949 
we get to dance all the time every day
because<00:03:14.610> if<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.850> went<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.150> university<00:03:15.780> we

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
because if we went to university we

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.570 
because if we went to university we
wouldn't<00:03:16.200> get<00:03:16.380> as<00:03:16.530> much<00:03:16.709> training<00:03:17.040> where<00:03:17.459> it's

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
wouldn't get as much training where it's

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.310 
wouldn't get as much training where it's
here<00:03:17.760> every<00:03:18.420> day<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.720> morning<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.110> have

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
here every day in the morning you have

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.470 
here every day in the morning you have
to<00:03:19.470> do<00:03:19.590> three<00:03:19.860> hours<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.220> dancing<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.970> think

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
to do three hours of dancing I think

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.870 
to do three hours of dancing I think
it's<00:03:21.600> about<00:03:21.690> 36<00:03:22.560> hours<00:03:22.709> or<00:03:23.040> something<00:03:23.250> contact

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
it's about 36 hours or something contact

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.940 
it's about 36 hours or something contact
time<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.480> then<00:03:24.660> outside<00:03:25.020> of<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.800> might

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
time and then outside of that you might

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.430
