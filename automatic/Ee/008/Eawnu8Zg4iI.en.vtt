00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
one question that I often receive for my

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.050 
one question that I often receive for my
friends<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.569> several<00:02:01.050> forums<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:02.190> what<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
friends in several forums is what is the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.300 
friends in several forums is what is the
magnification<00:02:03.780> ratio<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.560> these<00:02:04.679> macro<00:02:05.130> lens

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
magnification ratio for these macro lens

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
magnification ratio for these macro lens
converter<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.170> friendly<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.289> say<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.679> do<00:02:07.770> not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
converter and friendly to say I do not

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520 
converter and friendly to say I do not
know<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.269> is<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.660> stated<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
know because it is not stated in the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.520 
know because it is not stated in the
specifications<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
specifications so that's all for the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
specifications so that's all for the
macro<00:02:14.220> lens<00:02:14.430> converter<00:02:17.299> so<00:02:18.299> this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
macro lens converter so this is the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.009 
macro lens converter so this is the
super<00:02:19.110> wide<00:02:19.440> angle<00:02:19.620> lens<00:02:20.010> converter<00:02:21.019> usually

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
super wide angle lens converter usually

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.870 
super wide angle lens converter usually
I<00:02:22.049> do<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.440> use<00:02:22.709> these<00:02:23.010> supporting<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.700> last

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
I do not use these supporting the last

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.180 
I do not use these supporting the last
converter<00:02:24.239> alone<00:02:24.630> because<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.829> would<00:02:26.010> create

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
converter alone because it would create

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.910 
converter alone because it would create
a<00:02:26.370> really<00:02:26.790> heavy<00:02:27.090> big<00:02:27.390> nading<00:02:27.720> effect<00:02:28.079> as<00:02:28.290> well

basically I will show you guys at four

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.270 
basically I will show you guys at four
different<00:04:05.880> focal<00:04:06.570> lengths<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.590> first<00:04:07.860> one<00:04:08.070> is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
different focal lengths the first one is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.210 
different focal lengths the first one is
17<00:04:08.790> millimeter<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.990> second<00:04:10.380> one<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.680> 24

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
17 millimeter the second one is 24

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.340 
17 millimeter the second one is 24
millimeter<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:12.300> third<00:04:12.510> one<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.900> 35

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
millimeter the third one is 35

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.620 
millimeter the third one is 35
millimeter<00:04:13.770> and<00:04:14.070> last<00:04:14.610> but<00:04:14.760> not<00:04:14.880> least<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.390> at

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
millimeter and last but not least is at

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.729 
millimeter and last but not least is at
50<00:04:16.049> millimeter<00:04:16.470> at<00:04:17.600> first<00:04:18.600> sight<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.230> think

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
50 millimeter at first sight I think

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.259 
50 millimeter at first sight I think
that<00:04:19.950> these<00:04:20.250> ultra<00:04:20.700> wide<00:04:20.850> angle<00:04:21.120> lens

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
that these ultra wide angle lens

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.660 
that these ultra wide angle lens
converter<00:04:21.660> did<00:04:21.900> quite<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.170> good<00:04:22.290> job<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:23.460> there

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
converter did quite a good job but there

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.120 
converter did quite a good job but there
are<00:04:23.760> some<00:04:23.970> problems<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:25.260> first<00:04:25.470> problem<00:04:25.620> is

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
are some problems the first problem is

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.980 
are some problems the first problem is
the<00:04:26.220> vignetting<00:04:27.060> effect<00:04:27.540> at<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.750> four

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
the vignetting effect at the four

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.830 
the vignetting effect at the four
corners<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:29.280> second<00:04:29.700> problem<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.300> image

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
corners the second problem is the image

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.810

will not see any vignetting effect but

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.790 
will not see any vignetting effect but
the<00:04:53.880> softness<00:04:54.390> of<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.600> pictures<00:04:55.140> especially

the softness of the pictures especially

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.360 
the softness of the pictures especially
at<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.070> corners<00:04:56.550> still<00:04:57.180> noticeable<00:04:58.190> last<00:04:59.190> but

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
at the corners still noticeable last but

not least is at 50 millimeter of course

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400 
not least is at 50 millimeter of course
you<00:05:02.520> will<00:05:02.669> not<00:05:02.880> see<00:05:03.150> any<00:05:03.479> big<00:05:03.660> nating<00:05:04.020> effect

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
you will not see any big nating effect

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.830 
you will not see any big nating effect
but<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.130> image<00:05:05.430> quality<00:05:05.669> of<00:05:06.000> these<00:05:06.360> pictures

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
but the image quality of these pictures

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.680 
but the image quality of these pictures
especially<00:05:07.530> at<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.770> corners<00:05:08.280> still<00:05:09.030> really

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
especially at the corners still really

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.890 
especially at the corners still really
soft<00:05:10.700> so<00:05:11.700> now<00:05:11.880> I'd<00:05:12.000> like<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.180> talk<00:05:12.479> about<00:05:12.750> the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
soft so now I'd like to talk about the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.110 
soft so now I'd like to talk about the
performance<00:05:13.320> of<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.919> macro<00:05:14.310> lens<00:05:14.580> converter

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
performance of the macro lens converter

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.690 
performance of the macro lens converter
for<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.110> guys<00:05:16.260> information<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:16.979> have<00:05:17.220> attached

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
for you guys information I have attached

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.080 
for you guys information I have attached
it<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:17.970> my<00:05:18.240> Tamron<00:05:18.990> 17<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.770> 50<00:05:20.160> millimeter<00:05:20.430> lens

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
it to my Tamron 17 to 50 millimeter lens

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.810 
it to my Tamron 17 to 50 millimeter lens
on<00:05:21.450> your<00:05:22.350> left<00:05:22.560> hand<00:05:22.680> side<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:23.250> without<00:05:23.640> the

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
on your left hand side is without the

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.060 
on your left hand side is without the
macro<00:05:24.180> lens<00:05:24.390> converter<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.169> on<00:05:25.770> your<00:05:25.890> right

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
macro lens converter and on your right

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.860 
macro lens converter and on your right
hand<00:05:26.280> side<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.669> with<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.330> macro<00:05:27.660> lens

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
hand side is with the macro lens

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.380 
hand side is with the macro lens
converter<00:05:28.460> from<00:05:29.460> my<00:05:29.550> point<00:05:29.820> of<00:05:29.940> view<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.270> think

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
converter from my point of view I think

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.690 
converter from my point of view I think
that<00:05:30.720> this<00:05:31.080> macro<00:05:31.560> lens<00:05:31.770> convertor<00:05:32.130> performs

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
that this macro lens convertor performs

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.030 
that this macro lens convertor performs
really<00:05:32.970> well<00:05:33.169> especially<00:05:34.169> at<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.740> middle

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
really well especially at the middle

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.850 
really well especially at the middle
frame<00:05:35.370> but<00:05:36.150> there<00:05:36.390> are<00:05:36.479> some<00:05:36.690> problems<00:05:36.990> the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
frame but there are some problems the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.980 
frame but there are some problems the
first<00:05:38.070> one<00:05:38.340> is<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.729> chromatic<00:05:39.330> aberration

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
first one is the chromatic aberration

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.020 
first one is the chromatic aberration
running<00:05:40.740> across<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.250> boundary<00:05:41.669> of<00:05:41.760> the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
running across the boundary of the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.880 
running across the boundary of the
subject<00:05:42.600> which<00:05:42.750> is<00:05:42.780> not<00:05:43.140> really<00:05:43.440> flattering

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
subject which is not really flattering

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.159 
subject which is not really flattering
the<00:05:44.640> second<00:05:45.060> problem<00:05:45.270> is<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.630> softness

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
the second problem is the softness

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.250 
the second problem is the softness
problem<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:47.250> four<00:05:47.490> corners<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.990> that's

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
problem and the four corners so that's

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.680 
problem and the four corners so that's
all<00:05:49.590> for<00:05:49.919> my<00:05:50.070> review<00:05:50.400> today<00:05:50.700> guys<00:05:50.910> and<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.419> hope
