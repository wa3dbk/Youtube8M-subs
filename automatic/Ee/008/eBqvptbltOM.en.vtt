hey<00:00:03.060> guys<00:00:03.300> what's<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.629> on<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.319> couple<00:00:04.920> of

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
hey guys what's going on a couple of

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.309 
hey guys what's going on a couple of
loose<00:00:05.220> ends<00:00:05.609> from<00:00:05.730> last<00:00:06.029> episode<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.569> never

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
loose ends from last episode I never

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.669 
loose ends from last episode I never
told<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.589> my<00:00:07.620> name<00:00:07.740> my<00:00:08.099> name<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.370> Tyler<00:00:08.790> and

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
told you my name my name is Tyler and

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.589 
told you my name my name is Tyler and
also<00:00:10.679> one<00:00:11.219> big<00:00:11.580> thing<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.880> forgot<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.389> is

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
also one big thing I forgot to do is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.230 
also one big thing I forgot to do is
actually<00:00:12.870> teach<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.559> algorithm<00:00:14.400> notation

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
actually teach you algorithm notation

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.640 
actually teach you algorithm notation
which<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.660> basically<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> letters<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
which is basically the letters on the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.830 
which is basically the letters on the
rewriting<00:00:17.039> down<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.520> tell<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.300> how<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.480> move

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
rewriting down to tell you how to move

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.810 
rewriting down to tell you how to move
your<00:00:18.869> cube<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.529> order<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.949> home<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> certain

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
your cube in order to home a certain

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
your cube in order to home a certain
algorithm<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.779> let's<00:00:22.590> say<00:00:22.800> I'm<00:00:23.070> gonna<00:00:23.250> make

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
algorithm so let's say I'm gonna make

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.599 
algorithm so let's say I'm gonna make
this<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:23.699> front<00:00:24.000> face<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.160> I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
this my front face so if I want to if I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.870 
this my front face so if I want to if I
say<00:00:26.990> front<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.199> I'll<00:00:28.529> type<00:00:28.740> down<00:00:28.920> F<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.670> means

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
say front or I'll type down F that means

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.620 
say front or I'll type down F that means
to<00:00:30.150> move<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:31.050> face<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:32.489> time<00:00:32.520> clockwise<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
to move that face one time clockwise and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
to move that face one time clockwise and
let's<00:00:33.750> say<00:00:33.930> otherwise<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.610> top

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
let's say otherwise so this is the top

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.740 
let's say otherwise so this is the top
face<00:00:36.200> down<00:00:37.200> face<00:00:37.879> left<00:00:38.879> face<00:00:39.149> right<00:00:39.719> face

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
face down face left face right face

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
face down face left face right face
front<00:00:40.559> face<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.540> face<00:00:42.750> alright<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
front face and the back face alright so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.279 
front face and the back face alright so
now<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.730> covered<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.960> are

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
now that we got that covered we are

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.910 
now that we got that covered we are
going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.920> start<00:00:47.899> building<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> middle

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
going to start building up the middle

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.180 
going to start building up the middle
layer<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.969> cube<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
layer of the cube so to do this what you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.150 
layer of the cube so to do this what you
want<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.000> want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> make<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.660> T<00:00:55.260> like

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
want to do is you want to make a T like

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
want to do is you want to make a T like
this<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.870> side<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.250> cube<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.239> I'm

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this on one side of your cube so I'm

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
this on one side of your cube so I'm
gonna<00:01:01.109> start<00:01:01.289> off<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.410> orange<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.280> I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
gonna start off with orange and if I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.590 
gonna start off with orange and if I
look<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> bottom<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> have

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
look at the bottom I see that I have

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
look at the bottom I see that I have
this<00:01:03.930> orange<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> green<00:01:05.010> piece<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.850> know

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this orange and green piece and I know

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.780 
this orange and green piece and I know
that<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.450> fits<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that that fits there so if I want to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.300 
that that fits there so if I want to
move<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.000> into<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
move that into here what I want to do is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.190 
move that into here what I want to do is
I<00:01:11.430> want<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> move<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
I want to move this out of the way and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.160 
I want to move this out of the way and
then<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.350> gonna<00:01:16.439> bring<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:18.110> bring<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
then I'm gonna bring this down bring it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.390 
then I'm gonna bring this down bring it
over<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:22.759> there<00:01:23.759> okay<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:26.070> gonna

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
over like this there okay now I'm gonna

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
over like this there okay now I'm gonna
show<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.000> again<00:01:27.150> slower<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.560> one

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
show you it again slower on this one

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
show you it again slower on this one
alright<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> opposite<00:01:30.509> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
alright so now this is the opposite of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
alright so now this is the opposite of
what<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:31.979> last<00:01:32.040> time<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.640> want<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.909> move<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
what we did last time we want to move it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.390 
what we did last time we want to move it
to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> left<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:34.799> gonna<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> I'm

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
to the left so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
to the left so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:01:35.460> move<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> away<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.290> bottom<00:01:37.680> from

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
gonna move it away on the bottom from

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.190 
gonna move it away on the bottom from
where<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> want<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> go<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> want<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
where I want it to go so I want this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.069 
where I want it to go so I want this
piece<00:01:40.530> over<00:01:40.970> here<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.630> I'm<00:01:42.720> gonna<00:01:42.869> move<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
piece over here so I'm gonna move that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.889 
piece over here so I'm gonna move that
out<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.909> I'm<00:01:45.149> gonna<00:01:45.240> bring<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
out of the way then I'm gonna bring this

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.319 
out of the way then I'm gonna bring this
this<00:01:46.530> part<00:01:46.880> down<00:01:49.250> rotate<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.399> under<00:01:50.729> bring

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
this part down rotate that under bring

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.160 
this part down rotate that under bring
that<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:52.159> pull<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.210> turn<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that up pull this back and then turn the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.789 
that up pull this back and then turn the
front<00:01:55.439> face<00:01:56.060> counterclockwise<00:01:57.680> connect<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
front face counterclockwise connect it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.359 
front face counterclockwise connect it
back<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.159> bring<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.560> voila<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:02.340> is

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
back up bring it up and voila that is

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.580 
back up bring it up and voila that is
done<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:04.070> let's<00:02:05.070> move<00:02:05.189> over<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:07.170> made

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
done now let's move over here so I made

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.990 
done now let's move over here so I made
my<00:02:07.770> T

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.150 
face to the left one bring this down
pull<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.370> over<00:02:17.700> pull<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.480> one<00:02:18.660> back<00:02:18.720> up

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
pull this over pull this one back up

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.420 
pull this over pull this one back up
pull<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.820> then<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> clockwise

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
front face move bring this back up and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.140 
front face move bring this back up and
then<00:02:27.060> pull<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.540> up<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.990> now<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:29.150> this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
then pull that up and now we have this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.280 
then pull that up and now we have this
side<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:32.070> middle<00:02:32.580> layer<00:02:32.670> completed<00:02:33.390> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
side of the middle layer completed so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.320 
side of the middle layer completed so
now<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.740> got<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.010> find<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.790> last

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
now we just got to find that one last

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.590 
now we just got to find that one last
piece<00:02:37.110> which<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.350> right<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.940> want<00:02:39.480> to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
piece which is right there and I want to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.720 
piece which is right there and I want to
move<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.930> right<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.130> piece<00:02:41.610> is

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
move it right here because that piece is

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
move it right here because that piece is
in<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.910> incorrect<00:02:42.240> spot<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:43.440> since<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.740> want<00:02:43.920> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
in the incorrect spot so since I want to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.470 
in the incorrect spot so since I want to
move<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> right<00:02:44.550> again<00:02:45.180> I'm<00:02:45.360> gonna

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
move it to the right again I'm gonna

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.390 
move it to the right again I'm gonna
move<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.810> away<00:02:45.930> from<00:02:46.170> where<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.920> want<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.160> go<00:02:47.280> in

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
move it away from where I want to go in

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.699 
move it away from where I want to go in
the<00:02:47.490> bottom<00:02:47.760> layer<00:02:48.020> bring<00:02:49.020> down<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.350> right

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the bottom layer bring down the right

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.960 
the bottom layer bring down the right
layer<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:51.180> side<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.480> mean<00:02:52.220> pull<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
layer right side I mean pull this to the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.110 
layer right side I mean pull this to the
left<00:02:54.230> bring<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.320> back<00:02:55.530> up<00:02:55.709> pull<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.820> here

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
left bring this back up pull this here

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.630 
left bring this back up pull this here
bring<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.140> down<00:03:00.140> connect<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.380> up<00:03:01.640> so

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
bring that down connect the back up so

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.630 
bring that down connect the back up so
now<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:03.330> or<00:03:03.630> our<00:03:04.370> middle<00:03:05.370> layer<00:03:07.340> now<00:03:08.340> in

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
now we have or our middle layer now in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.280 
now we have or our middle layer now in
some<00:03:09.030> cases<00:03:11.390> when<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.810> when<00:03:12.930> you're<00:03:13.050> doing

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
some cases when just when you're doing

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.620 
some cases when just when you're doing
the<00:03:13.350> cube<00:03:13.560> can't<00:03:13.769> really<00:03:13.920> help<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:15.570> is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the cube can't really help it this is

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.330 
the cube can't really help it this is
going<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.260> happen<00:03:17.930> where<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.620> colors<00:03:20.130> that

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
going to happen where the colors that

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
going to happen where the colors that
you<00:03:20.550> want<00:03:20.850> are<00:03:21.380> flipped<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:23.120> obviously<00:03:24.120> you

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
you want are flipped and obviously you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.290 
you want are flipped and obviously you
can't<00:03:24.570> solve<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> cube<00:03:25.019> with<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:27.030> get

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
can't solve the cube with that so to get

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.750 
can't solve the cube with that so to get
this<00:03:27.570> piece<00:03:28.019> out<00:03:28.290> what<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.250> want<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.489> do<00:03:29.640> is

prime<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:39.280> D<00:04:39.460> Prime<00:04:39.840> in<00:04:40.840> our<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.340> D<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.780> F<00:04:44.760> then

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
prime the D Prime in our a D and F then

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.550 
prime the D Prime in our a D and F then
another<00:04:46.950> D<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.580> then<00:04:49.270> pull<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:49.990> back<00:04:50.020> up<00:04:50.260> and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
another D and then pull it back up and

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.430 
another D and then pull it back up and
your<00:04:51.340> middle<00:04:51.700> layer<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:52.330> your<00:04:52.600> 3x3<00:04:53.140> Rubik's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
your middle layer of your 3x3 Rubik's

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.300 
your middle layer of your 3x3 Rubik's
Cube<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.740> now<00:04:53.920> solved<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.650> one<00:04:56.950> is

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
Cube is now solved so this one is

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.940 
Cube is now solved so this one is
actually<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.510> middle<00:04:58.810> layer<00:04:58.960> is<00:04:59.350> probably

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
actually this middle layer is probably

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.910 
actually this middle layer is probably
one<00:05:00.100> of<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.280> easiest<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.850> do<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.920> just

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
one of the easiest to do so just

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.370 
one of the easiest to do so just
remember<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.370> when<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:05.020> you<00:05:05.110> have<00:05:05.230> to

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
remember that when that you have to

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.290 
remember that when that you have to
change<00:05:05.770> your<00:05:06.040> moves<00:05:06.340> depending<00:05:06.940> on<00:05:07.060> which

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
change your moves depending on which

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.720 
change your moves depending on which
direction<00:05:07.720> you<00:05:08.140> want<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.380> move<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.980> piece<00:05:09.520> for

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
direction you want to move a piece for

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.010 
direction you want to move a piece for
example<00:05:10.210> if<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.400> if<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.610> push<00:05:13.090> this<00:05:13.390> this<00:05:13.780> way

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
example if I if I push this this way

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.670 
example if I if I push this this way
then<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:16.300> piece<00:05:16.600> after<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.320> finish<00:05:17.560> the

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
then that piece after I finish the

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.440 
then that piece after I finish the
algorithm<00:05:18.100> would<00:05:18.190> not<00:05:18.370> be<00:05:18.610> in<00:05:18.760> there<00:05:18.940> so<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.270> B

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
algorithm would not be in there so the B

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.120 
algorithm would not be in there so the B
so<00:05:19.990> when<00:05:20.140> if<00:05:20.350> you<00:05:20.500> want<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.740> move<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:20.950> to<00:05:21.040> the

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
so when if you want to move it to the

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.430 
so when if you want to move it to the
left<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.580> make<00:05:21.790> sure<00:05:22.000> that<00:05:22.270> you<00:05:23.110> go<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.290> the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
left just make sure that you go to the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.510 
left just make sure that you go to the
right<00:05:23.620> if<00:05:23.890> you<00:05:23.980> want<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.160> move<00:05:24.220> it<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.430> the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
right if you want to move it to the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.280 
right if you want to move it to the
right<00:05:24.700> you<00:05:24.940> move<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.390> left<00:05:25.540> pretty

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
right you move it to the left pretty

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.100 
right you move it to the left pretty
simple<00:05:26.650> then<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:28.240> just<00:05:28.540> do<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.780> algorithm

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
simple then you just do the algorithm

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.630 
simple then you just do the algorithm
and<00:05:29.470> if<00:05:29.590> it's<00:05:29.740> if<00:05:29.980> you<00:05:30.130> want<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.340> move<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.550> to

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
and if it's if you want to move it to

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.050 
and if it's if you want to move it to
the<00:05:30.730> right<00:05:30.910> you<00:05:31.210> do<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.720> D<00:05:31.900> Prime<00:05:32.140> and<00:05:32.730> our<00:05:33.730> prime

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
the right you do a D Prime and our prime

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.350 
the right you do a D Prime and our prime
a<00:05:34.360> D<00:05:35.169> Prime<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:35.680> our<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.550> D<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.540> F<00:05:38.230> a<00:05:38.590> D<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:40.180> then

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
a D Prime and our a D and F a D and then

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.890 
a D Prime and our a D and F a D and then
pull<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.230> pack<00:05:41.380> up<00:05:42.360> that's<00:05:43.360> pretty<00:05:43.600> much<00:05:43.690> it

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
pull the pack up that's pretty much it

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.330 
pull the pack up that's pretty much it
for<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.110> middle<00:05:44.410> layer<00:05:44.620> I'd<00:05:44.919> have<00:05:45.040> to<00:05:45.160> say

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
for the middle layer I'd have to say

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.420 
for the middle layer I'd have to say
that's<00:05:45.520> one<00:05:45.760> of<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:45.910> easiest<00:05:45.940> ones<00:05:46.480> um

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
that's one of the easiest ones um

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.380 
that's one of the easiest ones um
sometimes<00:05:48.430> if<00:05:48.580> you're<00:05:48.700> lucky<00:05:48.730> you'll<00:05:49.210> get<00:05:49.360> a

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
sometimes if you're lucky you'll get a

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.060 
sometimes if you're lucky you'll get a
piece<00:05:49.600> already<00:05:49.810> fitted<00:05:50.169> in<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.680> then<00:05:50.830> you'll

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
piece already fitted in and then you'll

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.670 
piece already fitted in and then you'll
be<00:05:51.370> even<00:05:51.730> faster<00:05:51.960> thanks<00:05:52.960> for<00:05:53.080> watching<00:05:53.470> and

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
be even faster thanks for watching and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.010 
be even faster thanks for watching and
be<00:05:53.950> sure<00:05:53.980> to<00:05:54.130> check<00:05:54.370> out<00:05:54.490> for<00:05:54.640> my<00:05:54.760> part<00:05:55.150> 3<00:05:55.570> -<00:05:55.870> how

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
be sure to check out for my part 3 - how

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.080 
be sure to check out for my part 3 - how
to<00:05:56.080> solve<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.470> Rubik's<00:05:56.800> Cube<00:05:57.070> that<00:05:57.250> one<00:05:57.820> will

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
to solve the Rubik's Cube that one will

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.960 
to solve the Rubik's Cube that one will
probably<00:05:58.240> be<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:59.560> hardest<00:05:59.590> although<00:06:00.460> once

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
probably be the hardest although once

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.420 
probably be the hardest although once
you<00:06:01.180> get<00:06:01.480> get<00:06:01.780> it<00:06:01.900> down<00:06:02.080> it's<00:06:02.320> not<00:06:02.830> hard<00:06:03.220> at<00:06:03.370> all

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
you get get it down it's not hard at all

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.040 
you get get it down it's not hard at all
thanks<00:06:04.180> for<00:06:04.210> watching<00:06:04.300> guys<00:06:04.630> see<00:06:04.930> you<00:06:05.020> next
