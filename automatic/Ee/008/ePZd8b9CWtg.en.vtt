00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.389
 with the decorations of halloween and day 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.730
 dead and what better to start with 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.730
 This creepy little witch I hope 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 you need sweets you will feel which 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.220
 paint in black with vegetable coloring 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.650
 liquid and granillo equal in black 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.270
 lunettes and a soft candy too 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.940
 we need chantilly to paint green 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.530
 an ice cream cone which I covered with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.629
 chocolate that I painted in black too and 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.380
 of course to our cupcake we are going to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.480
 start by covering our bread that you cited 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.430
 with the chantilly 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.420
 let's cover the whole top part 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.420
 as usual 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.210
 Now what we are going to do is place 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.610
 our little hat that is the cone of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.250
 ice cream let's put it here 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.160
 let's press 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.810
 so that it sticks well now let's 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.399
 place the hair 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.399
 we are going to put it around 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.590
 pressing so that it sticks too 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.549
 let's put this side 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.689
 we can put in the back 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.689
 as well 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.070
 and now let's put a fringe 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.500
 good since we put all the hair 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.510
 now let's place the eyebrows we're going to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.780
 put some 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.780
 and two granillo appointments to simulate the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.750
 eyebrows 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.720
 so is this way 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.720
 up to make her look angry 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.610
 now we put the eyes that are the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.610
 canvases 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.640
 and 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.640
 m 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.690
 and now the last step is going to be 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.800
 the nose we're going to flatten a little bit 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.690
 our candy 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.690
 to be able to make a triangular 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.980
 well now let's cut a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.980
 triangular 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.110
 we shape it with our fingers 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.780
 and we put the nose we put a little bit 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:03:03.640
 of the chantilly so you have very well 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:06.570
 that if I do not dance water and cold with clive 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.570

 today 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.990
 let's put it down 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.990
 thus 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.530
 and well that's how we are left with this 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.620
