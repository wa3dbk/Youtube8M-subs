00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
everyone has a different nose so you you

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.900 
everyone has a different nose so you you
can't<00:06:01.030> lead<00:06:01.210> judge<00:06:01.510> a<00:06:01.780> book<00:06:02.470> by<00:06:02.530> it's<00:06:02.890> cover<00:06:02.950> so

can't lead judge a book by it's cover so

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.420 
can't lead judge a book by it's cover so
if<00:06:04.240> someone<00:06:04.480> says<00:06:04.840> oh<00:06:05.110> it's<00:06:05.470> not<00:06:05.620> that<00:06:05.680> good<00:06:06.070> it

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
if someone says oh it's not that good it

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.280 
if someone says oh it's not that good it
might<00:06:06.640> be<00:06:06.760> really<00:06:07.000> good<00:06:07.570> for<00:06:07.840> you<00:06:07.990> but<00:06:08.260> just
