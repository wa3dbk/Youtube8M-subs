00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.510

 aged need caring twice a day 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.930
 in the morning and in the evening necessarily because 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.270
 in the evening we wash off 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 and take care of our skin everywhere dust 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.760
 dirt that accumulates during the day 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.390
 and in the morning we wash the candles to those means 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.270
 who worked hard during the evening 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.330
 you probably know the lady what skin is it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 the largest human organ in this 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.960
 need to care not only for 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 handles legs body but first 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.810
 the queue for the face is always at the master class 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.940
 I ask a question please tell me how are you 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.090
 think why do you need care for 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.850
 sew leather why when we go out with a shower 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.950
 we dress but when we go outside 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.940
 we forget our skin too 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.780
 protect yes but this is the most important and so 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.590
 the first stage which is necessary for 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.120
 professional quality 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.100
 daily care is a cleanser 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.560
 cleanser botanical effects 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.270
 it is intended again for both 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.190
 dry normal and keep exactly 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.740
 combined there are two different 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.350
 moron code what kind of means is she 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.710
 sparing removes the dirt that they have 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.530
 appears on the skin of course also 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.050
 the main function of cleansing is gentle 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.810
 peel horny twigs that have 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.580
 You appeared on the skin during the day because 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.040
 that cells are born every day 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.120
 die are born dies therefore their 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.790
 need to clean 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.950
 also funds in its composition copper 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.800
 substances that transform the appearance 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.350
 pimples dries partially 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.140
 dries without drying without injuring 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.830
 skin is the next important stage which 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.800
 needs but this mask so she masochka 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.350
 You know, I always compare the mask with 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.880
 garbage bag here if we do 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.489
 general cleaning of the house 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.550
 what we do we take a clean trash 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.400
 pouch he closed new and start 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.500
 collect all the trash around the house 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.540
 accordingly, it is revealed and 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.110
 filled with trash exactly the same 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.620
 the garbage disposal function makes our 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.060
 oil why mask botanical has 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.140
 property that penetrate deeply 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.210
 inside the skin and pulls out fly and here 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.510
 all harmful substances that 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.970
 are on the skin in the form of pimples out 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.940
 and skin recover accordingly 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.290
 after we certainly devastated 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.200
 our garbage bag 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.750
 the main task is to close it again 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.640
 no garbage collected you must understand 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.760
 girls if you are not after the mask 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.980
 apply tonic the effect you 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.140
 It is very much expected to have your skin 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.560
 clean so that your black points were not 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.080
 on the face, respectively, not implemented 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.390
 because the main function is thin it 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.150
 close the trash bag to narrow pores 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.210
 after you made the general 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.450
 cleaning on the face there is still such a 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.700
 very important element is your level on 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.410
 your skin here you probably do not 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.820
 thought yes why and dry 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.280
 normal why am i fat and 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.640
 combination skin because u 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.540
 some skin is oily and combination 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.280
 because of 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.170
 glands that are in our skin yes they are 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.780
 produce fat much faster 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.750
 and some, for example, much slower 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.570
 and less so the ph level of someone 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.250
 higher one is lower on the skin and the main 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.130
 task after we did 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.990
 general cleaning because after 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.750
 we broke ph level on our skin 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.810
 make a fine balance perfect 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.140
 ph level on our skin that is not 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.750
 oily and not dry respectively tonic 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.050
 provides this function after 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.270
 we did deep cleansing afterwards 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.420
 deep cleansing general dress 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.570
 and then put a tonic of course at the end 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.610
 sure we complete 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.500
 moistening i often ask the question how are you 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.870
 Do you think you need to moisturize the skin 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.720
 one of the most common answers 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.870
 I have that oily skin 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.690
 clean the skin moisturize the skin because 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.280
 skin and so moisturized and now let's 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.310
 we will conduct an experiment with you 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.700
 take a cup of tea and kino piece 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.640
 the oil that forms is formed 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.400
 thin film so here it is 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.610
 here are the oils to on our skin and that is and 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.250
 lived on it not moistening moistening it 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.700
 tea which is at the bottom of our 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.380
 cups up to the bottom of our butter 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.920
 accordingly moisturizer he 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.950
 nourishes our cells main task 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.620
 moisturizer have feed our 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.930
 cells for them to live and for 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.900
 that new and new ones are born 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.840
 new cells yes so if you have 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.220
 even oily skin is very oily if you 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.970
