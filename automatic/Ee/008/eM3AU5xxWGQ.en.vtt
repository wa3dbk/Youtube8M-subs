Whenever you are ready..

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I have a Golf 4

It pulls about 320whp
at the moment..

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.930
It has a 2860RS Disco Potato turbo,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.980
ECU tuning was taken care 
by Fotis Lekatsas from RevLimit

My mechanic is John Tsekouras 
from TTS Garage located in Patra.
