00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.320 

and<00:01:18.020> then<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.830> Middle's<00:01:19.160> as<00:01:19.280> well<00:01:19.490> become<00:01:19.880> out

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
and then the Middle's as well become out

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.350 
and then the Middle's as well become out
looking<00:01:20.810> very<00:01:20.840> easily<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:23.060> makes<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
looking very easily so it makes the

guitar very responsive and if you want

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.280 
guitar very responsive and if you want
to<00:01:25.010> extract<00:01:25.280> like<00:01:25.700> an<00:01:25.850> inner<00:01:26.060> voicing<00:01:26.630> from<00:01:27.260> a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
to extract like an inner voicing from a

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.700 
to extract like an inner voicing from a
chord<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:32.150> can<00:01:32.180> do<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.540> super<00:01:32.960> easily<00:01:33.230> which

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
chord you can do that super easily which

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.950 
chord you can do that super easily which
is<00:01:33.920> very<00:01:34.310> important<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.690> etiology

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
is very important because the etiology

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.430 
is very important because the etiology
is<00:01:36.170> like<00:01:36.730> an<00:01:37.730> extension<00:01:38.180> of<00:01:38.420> your<00:01:38.900> creative

when I'm recording what I'm doing is I'm
using<00:03:05.239> different<00:03:05.989> guitars<00:03:06.350> because<00:03:07.280> one<00:03:07.520> will

music and so I think it's a good reason

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.350 
music and so I think it's a good reason
and<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.690> would<00:03:20.810> excuse<00:03:21.230> as<00:03:21.350> well<00:03:22.210> to<00:03:23.210> buy

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360
