hey guys what's going Sonia look a bit

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey guys what's going Sonia look a bit
too<00:00:02.310> brainy<00:00:02.490> video<00:00:02.820> here<00:00:03.360> on<00:00:03.600> my<00:00:03.780> channel<00:00:03.810> and

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
too brainy video here on my channel and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.590 
too brainy video here on my channel and
say<00:00:04.410> we<00:00:04.529> have<00:00:04.680> got<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.040> world<00:00:05.460> cup<00:00:05.879> squad<00:00:06.120> but<00:00:06.450> I

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
say we have got a world cup squad but I

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.150 
say we have got a world cup squad but I
thought<00:00:06.750> I'd<00:00:06.870> doing<00:00:07.049> these<00:00:07.170> simply<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:08.069> I

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
thought I'd doing these simply because I

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.400 
thought I'd doing these simply because I
haven't<00:00:08.370> actually<00:00:08.550> done<00:00:08.970> one<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:10.080> thought

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
haven't actually done one and I thought

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.780 
haven't actually done one and I thought
it'd<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.769> good<00:00:10.980> chance<00:00:11.040> for<00:00:11.340> me<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.519> go

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it'd be a good chance for me to go

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.789 
it'd be a good chance for me to go
through<00:00:12.000> someone<00:00:12.269> plays<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:13.410> generally

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
through someone plays and just generally

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
team a little bit more interesting and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.650 
team a little bit more interesting and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it was originally going to be around

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.069 
it was originally going to be around
Neymar<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:53.340> make<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.730> work<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.239> have

Neymar but to make it work and have

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
Neymar but to make it work and have
resilience<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> left<00:00:56.520> hand<00:00:56.730> side<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
resilience on the left hand side I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.959 
resilience on the left hand side I
pretty<00:00:58.079> much<00:00:58.199> needed<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.070> pack<00:00:59.309> Thiago<00:00:59.940> Silva

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
pretty much needed to pack Thiago Silva

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.110 
pretty much needed to pack Thiago Silva
my<00:01:00.510> spend<00:01:00.780> about<00:01:00.930> 200k<00:01:01.620> trying<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.760> Thiago

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
my spend about 200k trying to get Thiago

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.990 
my spend about 200k trying to get Thiago
Silva<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.899> couldn't<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.589> him<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.070> I've<00:01:05.369> had

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
Silva and I couldn't get him so I've had

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
Silva and I couldn't get him so I've had
to<00:01:06.030> throw<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.780> another<00:01:07.320> Brazilian<00:01:07.830> winger

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to throw in another Brazilian winger

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.520 
to throw in another Brazilian winger
instead<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.150> Neymar<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> other

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
instead of Neymar and it's on the other

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.950 
instead of Neymar and it's on the other
side<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.950> saw<00:01:11.189> why<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.580> got<00:01:11.760> Danny<00:01:12.420> outlets<00:01:12.900> but

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
side I saw why we got Danny outlets but

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
side I saw why we got Danny outlets but
as<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> bit<00:01:13.260> gutted<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.950> means<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
as a bit gutted because it means that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
as a bit gutted because it means that
the<00:01:14.460> defense<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.000> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.750> little<00:01:16.290> bit

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the defense is kind of a little bit

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.440 
the defense is kind of a little bit
boring<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.340> we've<00:01:17.580> got<00:01:17.729> an<00:01:17.820> Italian<00:01:18.299> defence

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
boring like we've got an Italian defence

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.480 
boring like we've got an Italian defence
and<00:01:18.930> goalkeeper<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.770> Danny<00:01:19.979> hours<00:01:20.310> it's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and goalkeeper and then Danny hours it's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
and goalkeeper and then Danny hours it's
really<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:20.970> good<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.170> Giglio<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
really really good like this Giglio is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
really really good like this Giglio is
actually<00:01:23.340> amazing<00:01:23.880> i've<00:01:24.240> never<00:01:24.540> used<00:01:24.869> him

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
actually amazing i've never used him

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
actually amazing i've never used him
before<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> right<00:01:26.909> back<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
before so i think is a right back on

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719 
before so i think is a right back on
normal<00:01:27.570> austin<00:01:28.049> same<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.979> he's<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> silver<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
normal austin same and he's a silver but

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
normal austin same and he's a silver but
he<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.990> good<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.770> game<00:01:31.979> he's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
he is so good on this game he's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.090 
he is so good on this game he's
absolutely<00:01:32.640> brilliant<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:34.500> pick<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.890> some

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that made this midfield kind of a bit

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.130 
that made this midfield kind of a bit
lackluster<00:02:28.680> one<00:02:29.400> they're<00:02:30.000> not<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.420> fastest

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
lackluster one they're not the fastest

may<00:03:29.730> view<00:03:29.790> who<00:03:30.060> giving<00:03:30.420> him<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.569> bit<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.870> hard

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
may view who giving him a bit of a hard

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.440 
may view who giving him a bit of a hard
time<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:31.530> also<00:03:31.769> team<00:03:32.130> he<00:03:32.549> got<00:03:32.700> my<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.940> 15

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
time but also team he got my like 15

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.330 
time but also team he got my like 15
goals<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:34.049> three<00:03:34.380> games<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.220> this

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
goals in three games and I think in this

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.849 
goals in three games and I think in this
one<00:03:35.549> over<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.209> course<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.720> first<00:03:37.530> four

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
one over the course of the first four

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.750 
one over the course of the first four
games<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.370> played<00:03:38.639> I<00:03:38.880> think<00:03:38.910> he<00:03:39.690> had<00:03:40.019> maybe

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
games I played I think he had maybe

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.250 
games I played I think he had maybe
maybe<00:03:41.760> three<00:03:42.150> or<00:03:42.180> four<00:03:42.420> goals<00:03:42.690> which<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.170> be

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
maybe three or four goals which to be

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.900 
maybe three or four goals which to be
fair<00:03:43.290> isn't<00:03:43.650> even<00:03:43.950> bad<00:03:44.040> while<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.310> slavin<00:03:44.760> bad

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
fair isn't even bad while I slavin bad

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.759 
fair isn't even bad while I slavin bad
at<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.569> remember<00:03:45.870> getting<00:03:45.959> hattrick<00:03:46.440> in

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
at all I remember getting hattrick in

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.379 
at all I remember getting hattrick in
his<00:03:47.069> first<00:03:47.280> games<00:03:47.489> also<00:03:47.700> i'm<00:03:47.819> probably<00:03:48.120> give

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
his first games also i'm probably give

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.319 
his first games also i'm probably give
him<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.810> bit<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.440> hard<00:03:49.620> time<00:03:50.329> considering

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
him a bit of a hard time considering

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.629 
him a bit of a hard time considering
he's<00:03:52.109> still<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> pretty<00:03:52.889> good<00:03:53.130> player<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:53.340> i

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
he's still a pretty good player but i

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.940 
he's still a pretty good player but i
think<00:03:54.120> i<00:03:54.209> found<00:03:54.269> we<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.690> was<00:03:54.900> they<00:03:55.560> just<00:03:55.590> don't

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
think i found we it was they just don't

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.620 
think i found we it was they just don't
seem<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.459> able<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.700> finish<00:03:56.910> one-on-ones

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
seem to be able to finish one-on-ones

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.680 
seem to be able to finish one-on-ones
and<00:03:57.900> i<00:03:58.139> found<00:03:58.739> out<00:03:58.859> very<00:03:59.190> very<00:03:59.400> strange<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:00.420> i

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
and i found out very very strange like i

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.870 
and i found out very very strange like i
could<00:04:01.380> sometimes<00:04:01.920> do<00:04:02.099> it<00:04:02.220> fun<00:04:02.370> with<00:04:02.549> hazard

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
could sometimes do it fun with hazard

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.210 
could sometimes do it fun with hazard
like<00:04:03.030> hazard<00:04:03.510> was<00:04:03.630> one<00:04:03.900> player<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.859> didn't

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
like hazard was one player that didn't

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.150 
like hazard was one player that didn't
really<00:04:05.459> struggle<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.269> benteke<00:04:06.870> i<00:04:07.139> don't<00:04:08.069> know

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
really struggle but benteke i don't know

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.770 
really struggle but benteke i don't know
what<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.400> was<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:08.700> he<00:04:08.910> really<00:04:09.120> seemed<00:04:09.660> to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
what it was like he really seemed to

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.080 
what it was like he really seemed to
struggle<00:04:10.680> with<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.069> old<00:04:11.220> one<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.639> ones<00:04:11.849> but

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
struggle with the old one on ones but

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.289 
struggle with the old one on ones but
santi<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:12.810> hazard<00:04:13.620> Hulk<00:04:13.980> they<00:04:14.819> didn't<00:04:15.180> really

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
santi and hazard Hulk they didn't really

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.140 
santi and hazard Hulk they didn't really
have<00:04:15.690> any<00:04:16.440> problem<00:04:17.070> at<00:04:17.160> all<00:04:17.370> with<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
have any problem at all with it but and

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.599 
have any problem at all with it but and
there's<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.750> bit<00:04:18.900> strange<00:04:19.109> maybe<00:04:19.470> with<00:04:20.039> benteke

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
there's a bit strange maybe with benteke

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.190 
there's a bit strange maybe with benteke
I<00:04:20.639> probably<00:04:21.359> should<00:04:21.599> have<00:04:21.630> crossed<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.109> a

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
I probably should have crossed in a

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.089 
I probably should have crossed in a
little<00:04:22.349> bit<00:04:22.440> more<00:04:22.590> instead<00:04:22.890> of<00:04:22.950> just

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
little bit more instead of just

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.620 
little bit more instead of just
dribbling<00:04:23.550> about<00:04:23.820> and

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
dribbling about and

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.660 
dribbling about and
a<00:04:24.660> little<00:04:25.380> bit<00:04:25.470> with<00:04:25.560> hazard<00:04:25.890> hazardous<00:04:26.310> solid

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
a little bit with hazard hazardous solid

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.940 
a little bit with hazard hazardous solid
for<00:04:26.790> like<00:04:26.910> his<00:04:27.060> dribbling<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.480> so<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.050> fast<00:04:28.320> I'm

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
for like his dribbling is so so fast I'm

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.710 
for like his dribbling is so so fast I'm
not<00:04:29.100> really<00:04:29.250> sure<00:04:29.340> how<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.820> has<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.270> go<00:04:30.420> that

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
not really sure how that has to go that

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.470 
not really sure how that has to go that
was<00:04:30.870> absolutely<00:04:31.410> dreadful<00:04:32.370> keeping<00:04:32.940> but<00:04:33.120> the

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
was absolutely dreadful keeping but the

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.990 
was absolutely dreadful keeping but the
team<00:04:33.660> was<00:04:33.810> really<00:04:34.110> really<00:04:34.470> good<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:35.070> would

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
team was really really good I would

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.350 
team was really really good I would
genuinely<00:04:36.620> recommend<00:04:37.620> maybe<00:04:38.370> changing<00:04:39.240> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
genuinely recommend maybe changing the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.970 
genuinely recommend maybe changing the
midfield<00:04:39.930> up<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.230> it<00:04:40.350> so<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.530> got<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.710> lot<00:04:40.950> of

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
midfield up of it so you got a lot of

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.800 
midfield up of it so you got a lot of
room<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.190> play<00:04:41.340> with<00:04:41.490> because<00:04:41.760> all<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.630> really

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
room to play with because all you really

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.830 
room to play with because all you really
need<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.230> Spanish<00:04:44.130> midfielder<00:04:44.610> or<00:04:45.210> Brazilian

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
need is Spanish midfielder or Brazilian

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.570

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
the team is good but I feel like the

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.780 
the team is good but I feel like the
midfield<00:05:33.480> really<00:05:34.050> really<00:05:35.040> death<00:05:35.250> now<00:05:35.580> like

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.250 
that was the only bad point like a pic
out<00:05:37.830> and<00:05:37.980> it<00:05:38.040> does<00:05:38.220> bring<00:05:38.820> it<00:05:38.970> down<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.420> an<00:05:39.510> 8.5

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
out and it does bring it down to an 8.5

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
s10 from myself but the rest of team was

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.390 
s10 from myself but the rest of team was
really<00:05:43.110> good<00:05:43.290> like<00:05:43.470> the<00:05:43.680> defense<00:05:44.130> was

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
really good like the defense was

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.190

events sometimes ciragan was a bit off

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.330 
events sometimes ciragan was a bit off
