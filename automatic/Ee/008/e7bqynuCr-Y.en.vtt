00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.720
 several of our subscribers asked me 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.059
 same question if i have 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.280
 cbs motorcycle then why should i study 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.199
 brake after all if i hold the brakes up 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.109
 I will lose a few maximum 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.210
 meters overall i'm sergey long arches and i 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.980
 decided to make a video answer to this question 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.199
 to show the difference 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.420
 but first, remember how I work 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.340
 front and rear wheel abs system 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.590
 motorcycle sensors are present which 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.609
 constantly report block bs speed 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.469
 wheel rotation 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.179
 if the turnover of one wheel becomes 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.249
 less system thinks she is 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.109
 locked and briefly reduces 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.559
 pressure appropriate braking 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.690
 contour 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.269
 thereby enabling tires 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.549
 re-mating with asphalt testing 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.859
 will be held on ctn 990 adventure 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.299
 It is equipped with modern anti-lock 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.440
 system which is possible if necessary 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.019
 turn off 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.699
 test pilot will be my damn quantum 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.319
 copy he doesn't say I don't know why in 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.289
 the first case, the brakes will be clamped 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:06.670
 sharp all the way so for the process 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.770
 braking will respond 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.570
 exclusively system bs in the second 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.609
 case we are their early quantum twin 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.619
 turn off the abs system and will slow down 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:17.009
 on the technique described by my previous 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.009
 video 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.760
 as we see manual mode is much 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.830
 such a difference is more effective than two 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.450
 reasons for cutting short 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 disables the brake to avoid 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.850
 wheel lock because of this fork 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.040
 loading not strong enough and slick 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.950
 rubber contact with the matchmaker is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.570
 less 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.870
 as well as the maximum brake 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870
 strength 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.760
 at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour we 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.680
 got such a difference so why 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.420
 The higher the speed the greater the difference 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.730
 in meters this way 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.830
 slow down you have to do it yourself 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 ps system like a condom 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.540
 secure only in the very last 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.800
 the moment is all 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.150
 next issue we can consider 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.040
 one of these topics 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.890
 so leave comments with 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.300
