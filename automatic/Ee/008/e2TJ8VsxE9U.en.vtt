 late they have that I'm not yet 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.990
 sure 100% but in any case I would 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.790
 work well with computers 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 to keep me company so for example 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.119
 do programming something 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.860
 like that and of course as long as I have the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.910
 time will continue the videos and then 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.910
 yes I like pancakes 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.390
 what do you think a political level ludo 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.130
 right or left - in fact I am 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.869
 minor so I have to shut up my mouth 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.890
 but I believe that for this question I 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.350
 let my colleague speak 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
 who is deputy of the general council of 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.650

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.010

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.450
 democratic I will say in the center 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.520
 why were you starting the videos 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.689
 continue you manage the stride but in fact 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.119
 two years ago with my brother we were doing 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.040
 cool little videos that tells and 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.060
 delusions we had if you want 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 I can show you a small excerpt 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.660
 here and I started posting my 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.340
 first video a year ago 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.830
 but otherwise it's been eight months since I 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.420
 videos regularly but at the base 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 I'm doing this just to see what that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.080
 gives and if people would love or 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.730
 not actually to I was going to forget the most 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.630
 important because the eyes I see them 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.010
 factors do not you play a 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.340

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.440
 priest who spoke French but good after 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.660
 if he organizes himself well 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.550

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.020
