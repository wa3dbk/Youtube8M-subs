00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
much of an honor was that as the added

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.330 
much of an honor was that as the added
responsibility<00:02:38.590> added<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.709> your<00:02:39.920> games<00:02:40.160> you

think it was a massive responsibility is
it<00:02:42.680> was<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.599> tough<00:02:44.599> task<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.560> manager

it was a tough task for that the manager

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.890 
it was a tough task for that the manager
to<00:02:46.310> pick<00:02:46.459> me<00:02:46.610> because<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:47.060> obviously<00:02:47.480> being<00:02:47.750> so
