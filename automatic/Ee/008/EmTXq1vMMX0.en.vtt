00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
can't turn it off so I'm just getting

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
can't turn it off so I'm just getting
going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.020> disable<00:01:40.530> fog<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> put<00:01:41.130> low

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
going to disable fog and put low

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.300 
going to disable fog and put low
accuracy<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.359> those<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:42.899> way<00:01:43.020> up

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
accuracy and put those all the way up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.959 
accuracy and put those all the way up
because<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.719> low<00:01:46.020> accuracy<00:01:46.700> because<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
because I like low accuracy because it

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.719 
because I like low accuracy because it
just<00:01:48.240> makes<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.439> bad<00:01:49.679> accuracy<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.429> so

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
just makes you have bad accuracy and so

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.059 
just makes you have bad accuracy and so
it<00:01:50.850> makes<00:01:50.969> it<00:01:51.149> harder<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.009> put

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
it makes it harder so I'm going to put

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.770 
it makes it harder so I'm going to put
triple<00:01:53.490> tap<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> kriti<00:01:54.090> struggling<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.539> and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
triple tap and kriti struggling on and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
triple tap and kriti struggling on and
so<00:01:54.959> we<00:01:55.140> load<00:01:55.319> XP<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.069> far<00:01:56.250> away<00:01:56.280> revives<00:01:56.789> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
