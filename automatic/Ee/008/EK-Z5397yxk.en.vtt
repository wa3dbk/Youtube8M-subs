right here and that circle is sculpted

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.099 
right here and that circle is sculpted
on<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:15.300> which<00:04:15.420> i<00:04:15.510> think<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.780> really<00:04:15.870> cool

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
on there which i think is really cool

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.050 
on there which i think is really cool
but<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.709> does<00:04:16.859> hinder<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.250> articulation<00:04:17.910> as

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
but it does hinder the articulation as

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.610 
but it does hinder the articulation as

far as just moving upwards so you have

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.199 
far as just moving upwards so you have
to<00:04:19.739> spin<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.100> around<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.880> know<00:04:20.970> all<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> way

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
to spin it around you know all the way

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.020 
to spin it around you know all the way

then this is the first wave where we saw

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.719 
then this is the first wave where we saw
these<00:05:06.869> stands<00:05:07.529> come<00:05:07.769> in<00:05:07.919> consistently<00:05:08.610> you
