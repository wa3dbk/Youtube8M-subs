00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
other thing I wanted to talk about is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
other thing I wanted to talk about is
that<00:01:08.970> I've<00:01:09.090> been<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.420> thirsty<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that I've been really thirsty and that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
that I've been really thirsty and that
started<00:01:10.770> before<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.340> started<00:01:12.030> banana<00:01:12.390> island

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.479 
like some kind of musical or play sort
of<00:04:16.200> things<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:18.709> we<00:04:19.709> got<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.280> an<00:04:20.370> argument

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
of things and I we got in an argument

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.720 
of things and I we got in an argument
and<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.870> was<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.320> mad<00:04:22.590> at<00:04:22.800> him<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.040> i<00:04:23.310> sat

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
and I was so mad at him that i sat

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.020 
and I was so mad at him that i sat
several<00:04:24.600> seats<00:04:24.900> away<00:04:25.230> from<00:04:25.470> him<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:26.010> that's<00:04:26.910> a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
several seats away from him and that's a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.550 
several seats away from him and that's a
big<00:04:27.210> deal<00:04:27.390> because<00:04:27.450> we've<00:04:27.930> been<00:04:28.050> together<00:04:28.230> for

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
big deal because we've been together for

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.380 
big deal because we've been together for
six<00:04:28.740> years<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.250> we've<00:04:29.460> never<00:04:29.910> had<00:04:30.240> an

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
six years and we've never had an

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.830 
six years and we've never had an
argument<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.760> I<00:04:32.790> was<00:04:33.120> pretty<00:04:33.420> upset<00:04:33.810> about

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
argument so I was pretty upset about

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.600 
argument so I was pretty upset about
that<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:35.330> then<00:04:36.330> at<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.350> performance<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.160> was

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
that and then at this performance I was

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.440 
that and then at this performance I was
served<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.470> hamburger<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.310> patty<00:04:41.820> on<00:04:42.270> a

served a hamburger just the patty on a

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.060 
served a hamburger just the patty on a
plate<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:44.430> went<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.210> eat<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.380> paused

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
plate and I went to eat it and I paused

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.890 
plate and I went to eat it and I paused
her<00:04:47.460> second<00:04:47.850> before<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.180> took<00:04:48.270> my<00:04:48.419> first<00:04:48.630> bite

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
her second before it took my first bite

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.990 
her second before it took my first bite
