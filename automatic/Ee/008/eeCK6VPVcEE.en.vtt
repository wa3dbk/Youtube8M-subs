00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
stability okay so you have to generate

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.819 
stability okay so you have to generate
some<00:01:40.210> tension<00:01:40.749> across<00:01:40.990> your<00:01:41.229> shoulders<00:01:41.649> to

some tension across your shoulders to
support<00:01:42.219> the<00:01:42.340> bar<00:01:42.899> my<00:01:43.899> technique<00:01:44.350> for<00:01:44.409> that<00:01:44.649> is

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
support the bar my technique for that is

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.590 
support the bar my technique for that is
to<00:01:45.100> act<00:01:45.429> like<00:01:45.639> you're<00:01:45.789> trying<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:46.090> slide<00:01:46.389> your

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
to act like you're trying to slide your

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.050 
to act like you're trying to slide your
hands<00:01:46.840> toward<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.350> center<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.709> the<00:01:47.799> bar<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
hands toward the center of the bar that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.760 
hands toward the center of the bar that
should<00:01:49.299> generate<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.929> necessary<00:01:50.200> attention

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
should generate the necessary attention

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.609 
should generate the necessary attention

shoulders alright learning an overhead
squats<00:01:59.459> first<00:02:00.459> start<00:02:01.149> with<00:02:01.299> just<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.719> bar

squats first start with just the bar

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.590 
squats first start with just the bar
this<00:02:02.950> is<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> very<00:02:03.399> challenging<00:02:03.639> exercise<00:02:04.329> so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
this is a very challenging exercise so

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.879 
this is a very challenging exercise so
don't<00:02:04.810> think<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.139> you<00:02:05.289> can<00:02:05.469> start<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:05.859> a

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:05.889 
don't think that you can start with a

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:08.580 
don't think that you can start with a
bunch<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.219> weight<00:02:06.689> now<00:02:07.689> your<00:02:07.840> first<00:02:08.080> attempt

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
bunch of weight now your first attempt

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.499 
bunch of weight now your first attempt
you<00:02:09.129> may<00:02:09.310> not<00:02:09.489> even<00:02:09.580> come<00:02:09.700> close<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.420> getting

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
you may not even come close to getting

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.960 
you may not even come close to getting
down<00:02:10.810> low<00:02:10.840> enough<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:12.310> some<00:02:12.549> people<00:02:12.700> will

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
down low enough now some people will

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.580 
down low enough now some people will
experience<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.840> enough

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
experience that enough

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.869 
experience that enough
think<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.069> just<00:02:15.220> don't<00:02:15.519> know<00:02:15.640> how<00:02:15.849> to

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
think that they just don't know how to

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.690 
think that they just don't know how to
do<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.239> exercise<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> truth<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.099> there

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
do the exercise but the truth is there

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.970 
do the exercise but the truth is there
is<00:02:18.819> no<00:02:19.030> special<00:02:19.569> technique<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.680> just

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
is no special technique but you just

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.140 
is no special technique but you just
have<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.640> flexible<00:02:23.400> my<00:02:24.400> primary<00:02:24.760> purpose

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
have to be flexible my primary purpose

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.839 
have to be flexible my primary purpose
for<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.870> exercise<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.160> show<00:02:27.190> people<00:02:27.670> that

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
for this exercise is to show people that

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.180 
for this exercise is to show people that
they're<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.330> flexible<00:02:28.810> enough<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.860> also<00:02:30.129> to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
they're not flexible enough and also to

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.509 
they're not flexible enough and also to
try<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.489> force<00:02:30.879> them<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.360> flexible

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
try to force them to get flexible

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.880 
try to force them to get flexible
okay<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.670> eventual<00:02:34.209> goal<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.379> be<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:35.769> as

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
okay the eventual goal is to be just as

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.100 
okay the eventual goal is to be just as
comfortable<00:02:36.160> with<00:02:36.549> an<00:02:36.640> overhead<00:02:36.970> squat<00:02:37.360> as<00:02:37.540> a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
comfortable with an overhead squat as a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.800 
comfortable with an overhead squat as a
regular<00:02:38.590> back<00:02:38.799> squat<00:02:39.480> alright<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.599> at<00:02:40.690> that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
regular back squat alright so at that

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.309 
regular back squat alright so at that
point<00:02:41.019> flexibility<00:02:41.799> is<00:02:41.890> no<00:02:42.099> longer<00:02:42.459> an<00:02:42.549> issue

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
point flexibility is no longer an issue

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.240 
point flexibility is no longer an issue
shoulder<00:02:44.319> strength<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.769> really<00:02:44.980> going<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.160> be

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
shoulder strength is really going to be

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.770 
shoulder strength is really going to be
your<00:02:45.370> only<00:02:45.519> limitation<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.360> exercise

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
your only limitation for the exercise

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.839 
your only limitation for the exercise
that's<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.829> goal<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.099> want<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.340> get<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.670> with

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
that's the goal you want to get to with

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.540 
that's the goal you want to get to with
