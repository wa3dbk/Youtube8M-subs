the drifting outside community in in
terms<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.900> real<00:02:42.050> world<00:02:42.320> right<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.710> mean

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
terms of a real world right so I mean

I'm really I'm really wanted to get more

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.380 
I'm really I'm really wanted to get more

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
involved in that a lot more knowledge on

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.600 
involved in that a lot more knowledge on
that<00:02:47.600> as<00:02:47.720> well<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.290> terms<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.770> just

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
that as well to in terms of just

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.520 
that as well to in terms of just
everything<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.270> do<00:02:50.360> with<00:02:50.510> drift<00:02:50.720> EVF<00:02:51.050> I<00:02:51.290> mean

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
everything to do with drift EVF I mean

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.890 
everything to do with drift EVF I mean
like<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> formula<00:02:52.400> drift<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.760> general<00:02:53.090> which

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
like the formula drift in general which

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.300 
like the formula drift in general which
is<00:02:54.050> huge<00:02:54.290> because<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:54.560> really<00:02:54.890> want<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.100> start

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
is huge because I really want to start

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.490 
is huge because I really want to start
getting<00:02:55.520> into<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:55.970> following<00:02:56.420> um<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.410> yeah

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
getting into and following um but yeah

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.010 
getting into and following um but yeah
just<00:02:57.800> really<00:02:58.190> just<00:02:58.459> broadening<00:02:58.970> my<00:02:59.150> knowledge

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
just really just broadening my knowledge

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.520 
just really just broadening my knowledge
on<00:03:00.530> drifting<00:03:01.280> events<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.240> general<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.050> just

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
on drifting events in general and just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.199 
on drifting events in general and just
everything<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.040> do<00:03:04.100> with<00:03:04.250> cars<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.730> mean<00:03:04.910> I

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
everything to do with cars I mean I

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.370 
everything to do with cars I mean I
don't<00:03:06.040> say<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.700> am<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:09.080> most

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
don't say that I am the most

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.720 
don't say that I am the most
knowledgeable<00:03:09.950> when<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.280> comes<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.610> this

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
knowledgeable when it comes to this

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.670 
knowledgeable when it comes to this
stuff<00:03:10.880> but<00:03:11.150> I'm<00:03:11.270> really<00:03:11.540> wanting<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.080> learn<00:03:12.290> so

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
stuff but I'm really wanting to learn so

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.740 
stuff but I'm really wanting to learn so
I<00:03:13.070> mean<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.670> lot<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:13.910> people<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.510> my

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
I mean I get a lot of people on my

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.300 
I mean I get a lot of people on my
budget<00:03:15.020> drifting<00:03:15.500> saying<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.770> has<00:03:15.920> no

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
budget drifting saying this has no

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.340 
budget drifting saying this has no
actual<00:03:16.730> like<00:03:17.330> relation<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.080> real-world

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
actual like relation to real-world

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.590 
actual like relation to real-world
drifting<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.070> that's<00:03:19.250> fine<00:03:19.459> my<00:03:19.760> all<00:03:20.330> my

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
drifting and that's fine my all my

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.030 
drifting and that's fine my all my
budget<00:03:20.930> drifting<00:03:21.230> are<00:03:21.350> not<00:03:21.500> supposed<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.920> be

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
budget drifting are not supposed to be

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.380 
budget drifting are not supposed to be
like<00:03:22.070> that<00:03:22.220> right<00:03:22.550> so<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.820> mean<00:03:22.970> they're<00:03:23.120> really

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
like that right so I mean they're really

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.830 
like that right so I mean they're really
just<00:03:23.620> my<00:03:24.620> own<00:03:24.769> thoughts<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.340> my<00:03:25.519> own<00:03:25.840> opinions

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
just my own thoughts and my own opinions

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.570 
just my own thoughts and my own opinions
on<00:03:26.989> for<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.350> game<00:03:27.470> but<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.400> something

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
on for the game but this is something

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.860 
on for the game but this is something
that<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.850> want<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.120> take<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.480> whole<00:03:29.690> new<00:03:29.810> level

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
that I want to take to a whole new level

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.650 
that I want to take to a whole new level
with<00:03:30.200> real<00:03:31.130> drifting<00:03:31.670> events<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.180> hopefully

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
with real drifting events and hopefully

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.600 
with real drifting events and hopefully
going<00:03:32.810> forward<00:03:33.200> oversteer<00:03:33.830> TV<00:03:34.190> will<00:03:34.340> let<00:03:34.489> me

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
going forward oversteer TV will let me

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.210 
going forward oversteer TV will let me
maybe<00:03:34.790> use<00:03:35.090> their<00:03:35.269> coverage<00:03:35.510> events<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.220> just

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
maybe use their coverage events and just

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.400 
maybe use their coverage events and just
kind<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.790> guess<00:03:38.150> relate<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.959> them<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.140> mean

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
