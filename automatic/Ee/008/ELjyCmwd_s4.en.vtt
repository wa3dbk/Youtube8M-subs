box and I'll let you move around
wherever<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.790> need<00:00:38.970> to<00:00:39.000> without<00:00:39.480> moving

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
wherever you need to without moving

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590 
wherever you need to without moving
protection<00:00:40.770> form<00:00:40.980> where<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> needs<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.940> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
protection form where it needs to be so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.389 
protection form where it needs to be so
continuing<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.380> upper<00:00:43.649> bicep<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.250> can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
continuing with the upper bicep you can

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.799 
continuing with the upper bicep you can
see<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:44.850> use<00:00:45.000> their<00:00:45.210> vent<00:00:45.420> armor<00:00:45.780> foam

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
see that they use their vent armor foam

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.830 
see that they use their vent armor foam
nice<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.860> segmented<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.790> connect<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
nice and segmented here connect it to a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
nice and segmented here connect it to a
high<00:00:49.140> density<00:00:49.410> foam<00:00:49.920> insert<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:51.030> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
high density foam insert and then you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
high density foam insert and then you
have<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> medium<00:00:51.899> density<00:00:52.230> thick<00:00:52.739> pad<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
have a medium density thick pad here and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
have a medium density thick pad here and
then<00:00:53.850> once<00:00:54.000> again<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.600> some<00:00:54.809> more<00:00:54.960> high

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
then once again we have some more high

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.290 
then once again we have some more high
density<00:00:55.590> foams<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:56.880> has<00:00:57.090> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
density foams you can see it has that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
density foams you can see it has that
segmentation<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.469> adding<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> overall

forearm<00:01:02.370> guard<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.450> more<00:01:03.629> vent

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
forearm guard we have some more vent

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.449 
forearm guard we have some more vent

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
molded to a forearm shape and then this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.889 
molded to a forearm shape and then this
foam<00:01:08.249> all<00:01:08.789> the<00:01:08.969> vent<00:01:09.209> armor<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.569> going<00:01:09.719> to<00:01:09.780> be

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
foam all the vent armor is going to be

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.349 
foam all the vent armor is going to be
nice<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.200> breathable<00:01:10.950> because<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.670> how

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
nice and breathable because of how

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.510 
nice and breathable because of how
porous<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.929> is<00:01:13.079> but<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.649> has<00:01:13.709> great<00:01:14.280> energy

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
porous it is but it has great energy

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
porous it is but it has great energy
dissipation<00:01:15.389> properties<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.469> it<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:17.279> on

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
dissipation properties to it and then on

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
dissipation properties to it and then on
the<00:01:17.520> other<00:01:17.549> underside<00:01:18.539> of<00:01:18.569> this<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the other underside of this the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.539 
the other underside of this the
underbelly<00:01:19.649> we're<00:01:19.889> gonna<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.249> thick

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
underbelly we're gonna have a thick

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.730 
underbelly we're gonna have a thick
layer<00:01:20.579> of<00:01:20.880> high-density<00:01:21.600> foam<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.139> this<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
layer of high-density foam so this is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.639 
layer of high-density foam so this is
going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.130> top-notch<00:01:23.869> protection<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.590> of

sitting on top of the plastic base and
this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.959> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.319> 25%<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:50.399> protective

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
this is going to be 25% more protective

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.730 
this is going to be 25% more protective
for<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.389> player<00:01:51.630> wearing<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.169> as<00:01:52.289> well<00:01:52.499> as<00:01:52.649> the

improvement from last year's total one

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.459 
improvement from last year's total one
as<00:01:58.049> well

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
as well

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.499 
as well
and<00:01:58.770> we've<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.069> some<00:01:59.310> more<00:01:59.520> cosmetic<00:01:59.999> ridges

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and we've got some more cosmetic ridges

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
and we've got some more cosmetic ridges
here<00:02:00.539> just<00:02:00.959> add<00:02:01.109> into<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.529> overall<00:02:01.799> real<00:02:02.130> cool

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
here just add into the overall real cool

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
here just add into the overall real cool
look<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.029> total<00:02:03.419> one<00:02:03.569> that<00:02:03.779> I<00:02:03.810> personally

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
look of this total one that I personally

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.069 
look of this total one that I personally
really<00:02:04.709> like<00:02:05.249> now<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> liner<00:02:06.899> I'm

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
really like now going into the liner I'm

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.590 
really like now going into the liner I'm
gonna<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.349> ahead<00:02:07.499> and<00:02:07.619> open<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.130> up<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.550> us

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
gonna go ahead and open it up for us

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.840 
gonna go ahead and open it up for us
we're<00:02:09.600> gonna<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:10.020> an<00:02:10.320> upgrade<00:02:10.800> from<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
we're gonna see an upgrade from the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.550 
we're gonna see an upgrade from the
thermal<00:02:12.240> Maxx<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> thermo<00:02:13.200> Max<00:02:13.440> Plus

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
thermal Maxx to the thermo Max Plus

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.650 
thermal Maxx to the thermo Max Plus
and<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:15.670> that's<00:02:15.850> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.209> little<00:02:16.480> more

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
and so that's going to be a little more

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.940 
and so that's going to be a little more
moisture<00:02:16.990> wicking<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:17.650> gonna<00:02:17.740> have<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
moisture wicking it's gonna have a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.190 
moisture wicking it's gonna have a
little<00:02:18.130> more<00:02:18.340> softer<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.970> touch<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.540> runs

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
little more softer of a touch to it runs

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.510 
little more softer of a touch to it runs
all<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> way<00:02:20.620> throughout<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:21.370> going<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
all the way throughout so it's going to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.430 
all the way throughout so it's going to
help<00:02:21.700> keep<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.030> dry<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.480> as<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.200> see

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
help keep you dry and as you can see

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.300 
help keep you dry and as you can see
here<00:02:23.740> this<00:02:23.860> big<00:02:24.160> Poron<00:02:24.970> XRD<00:02:25.500> elbow<00:02:26.500> donut<00:02:26.980> this

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
here this big Poron XRD elbow donut this

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.940 
here this big Poron XRD elbow donut this
is<00:02:27.520> going<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.730> be<00:02:27.910> their<00:02:28.900> best<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.560> probably

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
is going to be their best and probably

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.890 
is going to be their best and probably
their<00:02:30.130> most<00:02:30.400> advanced<00:02:30.970> material<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.720> Bauer

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
their most advanced material that Bauer

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.320 
their most advanced material that Bauer
uses<00:02:32.770> in<00:02:33.100> any<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.489> their<00:02:33.610> products<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.239> it's

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
uses in any of their products so it's

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.120 
uses in any of their products so it's
great<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.600> see<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.140> high<00:02:35.290> impact<00:02:35.470> area

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
great to see in this high impact area

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.830 
great to see in this high impact area
it's<00:02:36.489> going<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.670> help<00:02:36.760> dissipate<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> lot<00:02:37.720> of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
it's going to help dissipate a lot of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.690 
it's going to help dissipate a lot of
the<00:02:37.959> energy<00:02:38.110> when<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.739> land<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.280> you're

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the energy when you land on it you're

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.880 
the energy when you land on it you're
running<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.720> boards<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.319> it's<00:02:41.680> also

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
running to the boards and it's also

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.220 
running to the boards and it's also
going<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.280> feature<00:02:42.520> double<00:02:43.180> density<00:02:43.390> foams<00:02:43.930> on

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
going to feature double density foams on

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.380 
going to feature double density foams on
the<00:02:44.319> outside<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.040> pore<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.280> XD<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.000> then

plus the XRD so topknots protection from
top<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.410> bottom<00:02:53.590> I'm<00:02:54.220> gonna<00:02:54.400> go<00:02:54.489> ahead<00:02:54.640> and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
top to bottom I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.900 
top to bottom I'm gonna go ahead and
slide<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.420> elbow<00:02:55.720> pad<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.550> we're<00:02:57.790> gonna

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
slide this elbow pad on and we're gonna

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.090 
slide this elbow pad on and we're gonna
start<00:02:58.180> off<00:02:58.300> with<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.540> neoprene<00:02:58.750> Y<00:02:59.380> anchor<00:02:59.830> strap

start off with a neoprene Y anchor strap

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.309 
start off with a neoprene Y anchor strap
here<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.850> really<00:03:01.480> good<00:03:01.630> feature<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.019> see

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
here a really good feature to see

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.110 
here a really good feature to see
because<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.800> creates<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.220> little<00:03:03.400> barrier<00:03:03.819> from

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
because it creates a little barrier from

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.320 
because it creates a little barrier from
your<00:03:04.900> skin<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:06.069> risk<00:03:06.340> art<00:03:06.580> or<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
your skin and to this risk art or to the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.090 
your skin and to this risk art or to the
forearm<00:03:07.750> guard<00:03:07.989> so<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.680> give<00:03:08.830> you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
forearm guard so it's going to give you

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.580 
forearm guard so it's going to give you
a<00:03:09.130> little<00:03:09.489> more<00:03:09.840> comfort<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.050> anchors<00:03:11.440> in

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
a little more comfort but it anchors in

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.350 
a little more comfort but it anchors in
two<00:03:11.830> spots<00:03:12.069> that's<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.519> most<00:03:12.670> important<00:03:13.180> part

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
two spots that's the most important part

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.870 
two spots that's the most important part
going<00:03:14.050> on<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.620> main<00:03:15.040> anchor<00:03:15.430> strap<00:03:15.700> is

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
going on to the main anchor strap is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.790
