up<00:04:09.629> there<00:04:09.750> as<00:04:09.870> well<00:04:10.019> but<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.259> do<00:04:10.349> think<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:10.919> he

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
up there as well but I do think that he

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.009 
up there as well but I do think that he
would<00:04:11.280> eventually<00:04:11.430> drop<00:04:12.060> below<00:04:12.299> hall<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
would eventually drop below hall and

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.379 
would eventually drop below hall and
revis<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:13.979> he's<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.579> two<00:04:14.699> guys<00:04:14.879> I<00:04:15.030> want<00:04:15.209> I
