so<00:00:22.410> what<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.130> well<00:00:23.789> inside<00:00:24.300> you

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so what do you have here well inside you

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.500 
so what do you have here well inside you
can<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.830> movement<00:00:26.340> goes<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> way

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
can see the movement goes all the way

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.779 
can see the movement goes all the way
through<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.019> case<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:29.279> pictures<00:00:29.670> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
through the case you can see pictures of

calm its 311 parts
it<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:40.320> almost<00:00:41.250> four<00:00:41.700> years<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.360> development

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it was almost four years in development

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.869 
it was almost four years in development
just<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> movement<00:00:43.860> every<00:00:44.489> single<00:00:44.789> one

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
just for the movement every single one

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.360 
just for the movement every single one
of<00:00:45.030> those<00:00:45.180> parts<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.829> created<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.219> this

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
of those parts is created just for this

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.819 
of those parts is created just for this
movement<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> most

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
movement so it's really one of the most

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.290 
movement so it's really one of the most
amazing<00:00:50.430> pieces<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:52.399> technology<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.640> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
amazing pieces of technology that that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.560 
amazing pieces of technology that that
has<00:00:54.449> been<00:00:54.629> created<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> industry<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:57.390> can

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
has been created in the industry you can

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.979 
has been created in the industry you can
see<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> balance<00:00:58.020> wheel<00:00:58.350> spinning<00:00:59.070> there

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
see the balance wheel spinning there

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
see the balance wheel spinning there
it's<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> tornado<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.039> lot<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> people<00:01:02.609> think

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's not a tornado a lot of people think

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's not a tornado a lot of people think
that<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.019> an<00:01:04.350> exposed<00:01:04.769> balance

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that it is it's just an exposed balance

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.390 
that it is it's just an exposed balance
this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.939> sort<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.260> inspired<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this is sort of inspired by like the the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.310 
this is sort of inspired by like the the
rear<00:01:08.640> engine<00:01:09.150> deck<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> Ferrari

where<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.729> engine<00:01:11.880> through

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
where you can see your engine through

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.789 
where you can see your engine through
through<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.140> back<00:01:13.470> glass<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.890> case<00:01:17.540> is

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
through the back glass so the case is

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.969 
through the back glass so the case is
just<00:01:19.799> super<00:01:20.189> cool<00:01:20.400> inspired<00:01:21.240> by<00:01:21.420> aviation<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
just super cool inspired by aviation so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.340 
just super cool inspired by aviation so
max<00:01:23.939> used<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.299> play<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.630> model<00:01:24.930> airplanes

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
max used to play with model airplanes

the<00:01:27.210> Thunderbolt<00:01:27.840> itself<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.860> nickname

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the Thunderbolt itself is the nickname

for<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> a-10<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> an<00:01:30.450> anti-tank<00:01:31.020> plane

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
for the a-10 which is an anti-tank plane

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.700 
for the a-10 which is an anti-tank plane
with<00:01:32.189> these<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.670> big<00:01:33.170> reactors<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> top

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
google that you'll you'll see the case

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.260 
google that you'll you'll see the case
is<00:01:39.750> made<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.079> titanium<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:41.400> entire<00:01:41.909> back

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
is made out of titanium this entire back

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.490 
is made out of titanium this entire back
section<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.590> block<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.130> titanium<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:46.350> has

section is one block of titanium it has

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.280 
section is one block of titanium it has
to<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.770> milled<00:01:47.329> machined<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.899> inside

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to be milled machined on the inside

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.300

machined<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> outside<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.920> then<00:01:52.920> hand

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
machined on the outside and then hand

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
machined on the outside and then hand
finish<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.600> long<00:01:54.990> hand

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
finish so you can see this long hand

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.530 
finish so you can see this long hand
finishing<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:57.450> satin<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.680> polished<00:01:59.130> finish

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
finishing this satin the polished finish

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.240 
finishing this satin the polished finish
really<00:02:00.540> unique<00:02:00.930> finish<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.950> beautiful

really unique finish really beautiful

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.219 
really unique finish really beautiful
then<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.450> probably<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.079> most

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
then here this is probably the most

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.430 
then here this is probably the most
amazing<00:02:07.950> part<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.300> solid<00:02:09.869> block<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
amazing part that's a solid block of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.790 
amazing part that's a solid block of
sapphire<00:02:10.979> crystal<00:02:11.520> all<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.870> way<00:02:13.020> through

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
sapphire crystal all the way through

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.610 
sapphire crystal all the way through
this<00:02:13.980> whole<00:02:14.310> center<00:02:14.910> section<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:16.050> almost

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
this whole center section it's almost

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.760
