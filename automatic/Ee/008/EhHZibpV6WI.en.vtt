00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.940 
cross and jump rope and we're gonna go
back<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.240> side<00:00:35.450> side<00:00:35.750> basic<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.530> then

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
back to the side side basic and then

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.500 
back to the side side basic and then
from<00:00:37.220> there<00:00:37.400> we<00:00:37.520> gonna<00:00:37.670> learn<00:00:37.850> different

from there we gonna learn different

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.450 
from there we gonna learn different
types<00:00:38.630> of<00:00:38.840> crosses<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:39.710> that's<00:00:40.190> how<00:00:40.310> we're

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
types of crosses so that's how we're

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.479 
types of crosses so that's how we're
going<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.610> start<00:00:41.260> side<00:00:42.260> side<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:42.920> one<00:00:43.130> jump<00:00:43.340> in

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
going to start side side and one jump in

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.729 
going to start side side and one jump in
the<00:00:43.610> middle<00:00:43.700> okay<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:44.600> one<00:00:44.809> side<00:00:45.110> other<00:00:45.500> side

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
the middle okay so one side other side

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.970 
the middle okay so one side other side
and<00:00:46.190> jump<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:47.000> still<00:00:47.360> using<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.200> wrist<00:00:48.350> not

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
and jump and still using the wrist not

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.460 
and jump and still using the wrist not
jumping<00:00:49.400> too<00:00:49.580> high<00:00:49.610> okay<00:00:50.420> keeping<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.290> back

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
jumping too high okay keeping the back

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.619 
jumping too high okay keeping the back
straight<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:52.040> that's<00:00:52.550> going<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:52.970> be<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.180> little

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
straight and that's going to be a little

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.080 
straight and that's going to be a little
bit<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.840> basic<00:00:54.080> so<00:00:54.890> we<00:00:55.070> go<00:00:55.160> one<00:00:55.309> more<00:00:55.430> time<00:00:55.489> and

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
bit of basic so we go one more time and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.990 
bit of basic so we go one more time and
then<00:00:57.020> we<00:00:57.350> start<00:00:57.590> doing<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.100> cross<00:00:58.370> in<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
then we start doing the cross in the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.780 
then we start doing the cross in the
middle<00:00:59.270> okay<00:00:59.510> so<00:00:59.570> one<00:01:00.020> side<00:01:00.380> other<00:01:00.800> side<00:01:01.040> cross

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
middle okay so one side other side cross

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.049 
middle okay so one side other side cross
one<00:01:02.660> other<00:01:03.350> side<00:01:03.680> cross<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:04.369> if<00:01:04.490> you<00:01:04.640> check<00:01:04.850> I'm

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
one other side cross so if you check I'm

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.020 
one other side cross so if you check I'm
pointing<00:01:05.869> downwards<00:01:06.410> with<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.800> handles<00:01:07.160> okay

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
pointing downwards with the handles okay

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.660 
pointing downwards with the handles okay
reaching<00:01:08.750> wide<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.380> side<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.490> rope

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
reaching wide to the side so the rope

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.760 
reaching wide to the side so the rope
has<00:01:10.850> enough<00:01:11.090> space<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.360> pass<00:01:11.660> everybody<00:01:12.020> okay

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
has enough space to pass everybody okay

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.790 
has enough space to pass everybody okay
so<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:13.759> do<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.910> couple<00:01:14.210> of<00:01:14.270> more<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:15.470> can<00:01:15.619> also

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
so we do a couple of more we can also

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.740 
so we do a couple of more we can also
try<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.190> start<00:01:16.670> on<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.060> other<00:01:17.210> side<00:01:17.479> so

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
try to start on the other side so

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
to make a little difference and we try

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.990 
to make a little difference and we try
the<00:01:38.450> cross<00:01:38.750> from<00:01:39.020> both<00:01:39.290> sides<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:39.860> we<00:01:40.070> go<00:01:40.280> side

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the cross from both sides so we go side

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.500 
the cross from both sides so we go side
and<00:01:41.540> cross<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.380> other<00:01:42.680> side<00:01:43.130> cross<00:01:43.700> crossing

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
and cross and other side cross crossing

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.870 
and cross and other side cross crossing
from<00:01:44.690> both<00:01:44.900> sides<00:01:45.200> okay<00:01:45.560> one<00:01:45.740> side<00:01:46.040> side<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
from both sides okay one side side and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.510 
from both sides okay one side side and
cross<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.840> middle<00:01:47.869> hop<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.650> jump<00:01:49.310> over

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
cross in the middle hop and jump over

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.330 
cross in the middle hop and jump over
same<00:01:50.299> thing<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.049> now<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.290> notice<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.740> from

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
same thing but now you notice that from

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.890 
same thing but now you notice that from
one<00:01:52.490> side<00:01:52.729> is<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.060> right<00:01:53.210> hand<00:01:53.390> above<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.659> bat

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
one side is the right hand above the bat

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.580 
one side is the right hand above the bat
from<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.320> left<00:01:54.500> side<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.250> left<00:01:55.369> hand<00:01:55.610> okay

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
from the left side is the left hand okay

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.280 
from the left side is the left hand okay
so<00:01:57.590> it's<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.920> bit<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.250> difference<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.880> go<00:01:59.479> one

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
so it's a bit of a difference you go one

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.679 
so it's a bit of a difference you go one
side<00:02:00.560> other<00:02:01.130> side<00:02:01.340> always<00:02:01.939> alternating

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
side other side always alternating

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.870 
side other side always alternating
either<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.920> left<00:02:04.070> or<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.400> right<00:02:04.430> hand<00:02:04.729> is

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
either the left or the right hand is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.969 
either the left or the right hand is
above<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> other<00:02:05.270> one<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.290> once<00:02:06.770> you're

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
above the other one and once you're

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.729 
above the other one and once you're
ready<00:02:07.010> we<00:02:07.909> can<00:02:08.090> increase<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.810> speed<00:02:08.989> up<00:02:09.290> and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
ready we can increase the speed up and

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.030 
ready we can increase the speed up and
