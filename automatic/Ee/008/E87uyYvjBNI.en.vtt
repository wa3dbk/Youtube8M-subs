00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.090
 tells crowd bruninho sassetti back 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.340
 all good beauty today number wanted 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 talk to you about the eternal 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.500
 humor from a code of zombies only or 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.689
 a game of zombies even though 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 do not come to call code developed only 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.510
 on tv 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.699
 I should have already mentioned that in some 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.650
 moment in the channel because this robot 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.529
 I happen to believe that since the time 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 of black ops 1 and it comes to gain strength 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 this year because of the news that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950
 has already received there that the code 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 this year will be developed by led 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 not me by treyarch andrÃ© that just will 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.820
 develop the code in 2015 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 and as the led rever does not have the right to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.410
 Make a net shadows game do the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 way men within the code 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.809
 this right would only be entered here 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.940
 We only have shadows in 2015 which 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.980
 always raise the rumor that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.590
 maybe this year so we come to a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.000
 Only yesterday's game let enjoy 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.519
 to kill two rabbits with one 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 water tank and only my opinion on 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.689
 this issue of led and develop the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.119
 This year's game had a crowd that already 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.750
 asked and on the twitter channel I 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.909
 I think the fact that sledgehammer 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.100
 involve more so we already knew 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.630
 this generates a sung letter because the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 renner stores have been working together 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 with infinity ward since mw3 in a 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.189
 avoided 13 she developed the maps and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.740
 were good maps were legal maps 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.049
 in mw3 they were not all but had maps 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.670
 cool , I do not like to confess that I do not know 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.560
 neither what they are doing that was 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.930
 filipe borges but any way 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.490
 will be both indy and tetra and I will not 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.020
 I believe they can make a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.600
 I play very badly I do not believe it goes 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.479
 stay there in what is the code smo and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.909
 of course there is always the possibility of it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.040
 to be surprised positively 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.290
 will suddenly present in aspects of the game 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.110
 that we still do not know that we can 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.270
 bring greater fun right suddenly 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.280
 The best news I see it clear 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.780
 It's up to here, you have a little more time. 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.700
 to develop the game 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.940
 in general the developers to infinity 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 ward between 20 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.680
 in a year and then during the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.830
 another year after the game is released 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.630
 there giving support doing them pet etc 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.190
 then is one and a half to run 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.290
 develop the game we usually do 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.390
 say that the game that we get as well 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.100
 that boom is about a beta for 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.860
 people can figure out how it is and there 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.540
 play after six months begins to have 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.480
 the face of what the game really is after 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.490
 of various pieces etc. then to train you 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.710
 two years there to develop the next 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.080
 cut and the code I believe will be 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.940
 entirely of the new generation will be 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.670
 extremely positive this news I 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.220
 I think it right great as I was coming 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.350
 talking opens is that always the precedent 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.870
 for us to speculate again on the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.480
 question and the possibility of cutting only 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.580
 I do not believe that going into that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.100
 I can do it, I think 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.410
 doing will also be positive and I 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.960
 I believe because it's obvious that it will 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.700
 money she can separate and a team 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.100
 to make men are already teams 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.930
 different the staff made the men of the 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.030
 Bonfim was a fully staffed 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.550
 different from that made a multiplayer is 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.650
 good not miss a goal two nuon chea 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.840
 there was still a mixture and some 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.430
 professionals then stirred in the two areas 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.590
 both in games and in multiplayer 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.140
 but do not see the 2 has completely 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.120
 separated so he already has a team only 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.550
 for NGOs and this can suddenly 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.739
 they can separate make you pick up from 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.560
 Suddenly authorization Tijuca distribute 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.959
 and play a game of probes there more 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.390
 or less in the way the 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.970
 2 believe until at 2 had so much 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.560
 change as well as a test can even 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.830
 possibility exists that this is already 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.200
 being talked about and in 2015 they will 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.120
 launch a Belgian 3 let's say 'going 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.160
 kicking any name about us 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.989
 follow here in the pattern and there will be a 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.480
 very different sound the men suddenly 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.850
 coming back to be what it was or keeping the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.560
 pattern suddenly if this game in 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 was a success and I believe that 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.980
 will be at least going to sell enough 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.720
 I do not know that a lot of people are going to continue 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.740
 playing of course I'm going to buy if 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.530
 leave a game alone 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.240
 names then in 2015 we will have a 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.190
 way the games for sure I do not 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.710
 I think this will stop having 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.320
 but it may depend on how 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.910
 he was executed there will depend on this 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.890
 game that can be released of course 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.140
 that this is just a possibility are more 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.570
 chances there is no news only one 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.660
 rumor, but we always like 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.030
 discuss hoping to leave a game 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.800
 only men have no good way but 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.450
 that's what you saw there at the end of the 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.800
 that I was frustrated 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.750
 front with three players who did not 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.210
 were living in making a tribute kill 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.610
 The game ended and I did not 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.320
 I can do nothing good, that's it, I'll go 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.600
 to close the video here I'll ask 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.430
 for you to rate the video and leave a 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.470
 comment and sign up for the channel if 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.180
 you have not registered yet I'll see you in the 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.180
 Next video a hug
