00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.779
 avant-garde that promises to introduce us 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.240
 fully in a universe of new and 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.000
 wonderful sensations the reality 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.829
 virtual yes because it was invented that already 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.960

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.610
 is back on everyone 's lips now 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.920
 that also begins to pass the fashion of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.360
 the 3d is the time to look for a 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.730
 new invention with which to leave us 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.800
 our savings and that is as if not 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.039
 it was enough with spending 400 or 500 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.530
 euros in a console nexgen and 60 or 70 in 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.719

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.290
 Microsoft for its part was not going to be 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.720
 less in this to get rid of the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.369
 users something in what without place to 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.590
 own virtual reality device 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.530

 kinect that does not finish raising the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.159

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.380
 They are able to cope with the demand for what is not 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.540
 they have another to try to endure with 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.980
 what they have until summer and if 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.690
 you are also one of those who criticize 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.130
 death the kinect xbox one but you 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.590
 you get away from having in your house the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.240
 playstation camera runs even more because 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.130
 chains like gamestop are going up 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.460
 the price in the usa to see that they are sold 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.460
 like donuts 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.229
 and that we have today of our beloved 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.330
 nintendo then your confirmation that there 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.910
 More than 60 games underway for wild 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.950
 developed under that motor 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.390
 graphic that the company gives to all 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.069
 those brave who dare to 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.830
 invest your time and money in 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.970
 develop a game for your desktop and 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.010
 how the strategy seems to be 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.750
 working them pretty well 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.000
 they have also confirmed their intention to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.519
 adapt that same engine to your laptop 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.670
 3ds on the other hand all those who 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.049
 you fear for the health of the great n 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.370
 calm because according to a study 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.620
 financially made by the own 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.170
 nintendo only with the money they have 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.090
 saved can survive 38 more years 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.980
 is what has to take consoles 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.980
 out of phase at prices of healthy livers 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.130
 that if it is so failing it is the pump that 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.110
 it has become the biggest release 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.270
 from the history of xbox that has 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.140
 managed to increase by 96 percent 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.240
 x-men sales in the UK- very good 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.250
 the fact is that little or nothing has lasted 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.380
 the leadership to the game of riesch bread and 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.340
 that in famous second are you just 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.500
 snatch the position in the lists 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.680
 british getting step doubling 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.060
 sales of ps 4 we go that it seems that 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.980
 of little has served to the console 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.070
 microsoft the push that has given him the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.140
 shooter is what the competition has 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.380
 how well you lived in times of monopoly 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.380
 true 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.260
 new year assassin's creed new and is 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.060
 that some of us have not completed the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.070
 half of black black and we already feel 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.320
 on the back of the neck the harassment of the new 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.180
 deliver an assassin's creed juniti that 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.250
 ubisoft has decided to confirm with a 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.630
 brief teaser after the filtering of a 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.370
 good bunch of images about your 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.170
 Parisian atmosphere 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.150
 finally issued results is what 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.340
 we were all waiting for the first game of the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.680
 saga developed exclusively for pc 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.330
 and the new generation of consoles with a 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.910
 launch planned for this same 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.920
 autumn finally returning to a period 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.640
 historical really relevant as 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.640
 the French revolution 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.640
 stark to you adds to that limbo of 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.040
 games always expected by fans 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.050
 like a have life 3 and the last card already 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.940
 It seems that despite the fact that 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.740
 we thought dead and buried after his 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.330
 cancellation in the playstation 2 era 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.280
 and the first xbox 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.350
 blizzard has decided to keep the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.790
 calls affirming that now they no longer count 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.769
 with the hardware limitations of 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.510
 past if they wanted to relive the one 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.430
 would be his first grass in 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.500
 shutter although they have recognized that no 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.600
 It will be soon and knowing the pace that 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.250
 they work in visar we can wait 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.990
 sitting down to the next generation of 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.990
 consoles if it comes 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.330
 just an example of what 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.250
 you should not do and that is how 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.620
 The daily ' mail' picks up a young man 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.080
 14 year old girl fell into a coma after getting a 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.199
 lady vicious to the call of duty over 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.419
 16 hours followed by 4 liters 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.280
 of energy drink something that made 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.840
 your central nervous system the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.060
 cardiovascular the lungs and 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.039
 kidneys fails him by sending him straight 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.900
 to the hospital for two weeks 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.520
 it is clear that he did 16 hours without 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.849
 rest is not something precisely 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.409
 healthy but it's even worse to get 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.629
 end to drinks designed to 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.440
 athletes when you move less than 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.440
