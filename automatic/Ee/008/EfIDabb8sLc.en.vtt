00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.470

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.950
 we are not going to wear a helmet 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.220

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.220

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.360
 texture pack also contains this fire 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.900

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.520
 I wanted to show you the house 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.950

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.050

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.280

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.490
 make this this kind of house pretty 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.400
 easy truth and it is very cool 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.230
 I also upload a video by doing a tutorial 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.740
 how to do it is very easy 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.740
 and well here we will have a little house 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.530
 let's enter those that have many 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.100
 things basically I want to teach them 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.110
 the airbag text the sofas just like it 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 much this wall because it's like wool 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.509
 how they had the assets 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.509
 I put here there is the small kitchen 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.370
 and the bed and well basically it's all 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.709
 this texture for all this has changed 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.510
 of colors because it 's pretty old and 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.100
 It's also a pack, that's why I like it 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.510
 you also see that the positions are 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.170
 different 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.600
 everything is quite changed and that's why I 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.360
 I like this text a couple I do not like 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.980
