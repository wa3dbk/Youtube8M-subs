 and the same without James to the band 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.510
 I'm a mechatronics technician 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.459
 The simulated mission starts 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.169
 through the icnas work that senise you can give two clicks 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.960
 start the program or through the mech- 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.169
 senise 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.169
 is excellent and that csn yields 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.100
 the travelex 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.230

 I'm going to choose JoÃ£o in Portuguese 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.350
 will come back and diffuse individual ' 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.380
 voip that I chose suddenly without sarmet 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.930
 system to use 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 to the top of toussaint i will choose kirk 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700
 formed that 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.640
 zero ecv 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 and other teams start 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 to seem that tip of the day the stump leaves crushed or disarmed through 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 option here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.880
 show attitude 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.840
 I suppose such 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 because the body is a crime 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 on the oc 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 note that the side menu 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 the icons are off 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 this is why the program is not working yet 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.760
 now I can go here you can see that there is some ex 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 the assets 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 can not miss it here 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.780
 this great difficulty you identify with being fired 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.280
 through the icon 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.650
 single button 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.570
 safety 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 of emergency 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.569
 passione 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.569
 look what appears 11 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:23.259

 the alarm is on 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.269
 it refers to the door 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.269
 we will see
