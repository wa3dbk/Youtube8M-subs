00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.780
 the trap 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.150
 a mouse looking through a hole in the 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.940

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.490

 food could have been there 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.590
 terrified when he discovered that it was 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.630
 a mouse trap was running to the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.809

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:34.780
 in the house the chicken that was 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.110
 cackling and scratching raised the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.969
 head and said excuse me mister mouse yo 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.269

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.040

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.340

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 remembered in my prayers the mouse was 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.460
 He then directed the cow and the cow 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.820
 repeated the same perhaps I am in danger 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.159
 I think the cow did not say then 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.680
 mouse came back home worried and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.560
 dejected to face the mousetrap of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.570
 farmer that night he heard a great 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 the noise of a mousetrap 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.160
 catching his victim the woman of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 farmer ran to see what he had 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.470
 stuck in the dark she did not see that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.530
 the mouse trap caught the tail of a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.020
 poisonous snake the snake bit 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.050
 the woman the farmer took her 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.539
 immediately to the hospital she came back 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.880
 with fever everyone knows that to 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.650
 feed someone with a fever nothing 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.900
 better than a soup 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.180
 the farmer grabbed his knife and went to 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.120
 look for the main ingredient the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.880
 Hen as the disease of women 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.210
 continued the friends and neighbors went to 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.120
 visit her to feed them the farmer 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.940
 killed the lamb the woman did not improve and 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.399
 Then the farmer died 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.490
 sold the cow to the slaughterhouse to cover 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.260
 funeral expenses next time 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.560
 that you hear that someone has a 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.080
 problem and you think that since it's not yours 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.420
 you must pay attention to think two 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.360
 times 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.849
