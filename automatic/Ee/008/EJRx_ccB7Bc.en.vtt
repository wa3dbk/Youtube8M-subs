all five petals and they look like this

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.910 
all five petals and they look like this
you<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:34.010> move<00:02:34.220> them<00:02:34.400> over<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> forming<00:02:35.569> cup

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
you can move them over to a forming cup

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.300 
you can move them over to a forming cup
while<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.010> work<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.459> next<00:02:37.670> set<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:37.910> petals

roll and cut another set of petals but

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.190 
roll and cut another set of petals but
we're<00:02:51.370> only<00:02:51.490> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.940> use<00:02:52.240> three<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.840> them

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
we're only going to use three of them

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.790 
we're only going to use three of them
for<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.620> inner<00:02:53.860> petals<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.450> cut<00:02:55.780> away<00:02:56.050> two

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
for the inner petals so cut away two

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.750 
for the inner petals so cut away two
with<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.190> small<00:02:57.550> knife<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.090> set<00:02:58.840> them<00:02:58.990> aside

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
press these petals into the petals I

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.460 
press these petals into the petals I
already<00:03:35.190> have<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.640> forming<00:03:36.060> cup<00:03:36.320> well<00:03:37.320> you

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
already have in the forming cup well you

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.620 
already have in the forming cup well you
need<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.860> little<00:03:38.160> pressure<00:03:38.460> to<00:03:38.970> stick<00:03:39.390> them

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630

need is a little pressure to stick them
to<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.870> other<00:03:40.080> petals<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.230> when<00:03:43.470> you're<00:03:43.650> done

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
to the other petals so when you're done

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.809 
to the other petals so when you're done
the<00:03:44.880> petals<00:03:45.270> should<00:03:45.450> look<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:45.750> this

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.490 

next<00:03:49.819> we're<00:03:49.939> going<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.209> form<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.840> dark<00:03:51.049> center

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
next we're going to form the dark center

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.410 
next we're going to form the dark center
so<00:03:52.129> take<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.370> place<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.939> the<00:03:53.150> dark

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.509 
smooth this is about the size of the pea
put<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.659> into<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.140> center<00:04:00.379> of<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.799> magnolia

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
put it into the center of the magnolia

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.410
