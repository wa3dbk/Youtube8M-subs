what's it all about
it's<00:00:36.910> about<00:00:37.120> willing<00:00:37.720> dice<00:00:37.990> and<00:00:39.330> deactivating

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
it's about willing dice and deactivating

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.630 
it's about willing dice and deactivating
lasers<00:00:40.840> Oh

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
lasers Oh

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.370

these lasers oh you've got them all over

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.420 
these lasers oh you've got them all over
the<00:00:46.690> board<00:00:46.900> but<00:00:47.830> they<00:00:47.950> don't<00:00:48.190> look<00:00:48.370> like

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
the board but they don't look like

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.700 
the board but they don't look like
they're<00:00:48.760> stable<00:00:49.290> tell<00:00:50.290> me<00:00:50.380> what<00:00:50.530> those

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
those lasers you are trying to

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.789 
those lasers you are trying to
deactivate<00:01:03.490> them<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.390> walk<00:01:04.989> right<00:01:05.170> over<00:01:05.229> all

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
deactivate them and walk right over all

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.770 
deactivate them and walk right over all
right<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.310> here's<00:01:06.700> your<00:01:06.820> pieces<00:01:07.060> your<00:01:07.570> guys

center room sweet well why don't you
show<00:01:11.229> me<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.740> turn<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.340> how<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.579> goes<00:01:12.729> all<00:01:13.420> right

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
show me a turn and how it goes all right

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830 
show me a turn and how it goes all right
so<00:01:15.960> let's<00:01:16.960> say<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.350> was<00:01:17.770> clean<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.600> first

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
so let's say I was clean and the first

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.380 
so let's say I was clean and the first
number<00:01:20.259> is<00:01:20.560> 8<00:01:21.399> okay

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
number is 8 okay

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.959 
number is 8 okay
so<00:01:23.259> nice<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:24.749> would<00:01:25.749> try<00:01:26.079> to<00:01:26.109> get<00:01:26.439> 8<00:01:26.679> and<00:01:27.039> how<00:01:27.909> do

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
so nice I would try to get 8 and how do

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.510 
so nice I would try to get 8 and how do
you<00:01:28.060> how<00:01:28.689> do<00:01:28.749> you<00:01:28.869> do<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.200> on<00:01:29.409> this<00:01:30.009> one<00:01:30.069> I

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
you how do you do it on this one I

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.690 
you how do you do it on this one I
actually<00:01:30.850> ruled<00:01:31.420> an<00:01:31.600> eight<00:01:31.780> okay<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.429> can

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
actually ruled an eight okay so I can

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.620 
actually ruled an eight okay so I can
just<00:01:33.880> set<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.240> aside

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
just set that aside

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.080 
just set that aside
yeah<00:01:35.289> that<00:01:35.979> dies<00:01:36.219> to<00:01:36.460> get<00:01:36.579> over<00:01:36.759> that<00:01:36.850> laser

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
yeah that dies to get over that laser

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.830 
yeah that dies to get over that laser
nice<00:01:37.479> yes<00:01:38.109> no<00:01:38.829> what<00:01:39.069> now<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.880> need<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.719> know

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
nice yes no what now I need to you know

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.819 
nice yes no what now I need to you know
with<00:01:41.049> to<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:43.539> how<00:01:43.719> can<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.990> use<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.380> dice<00:01:44.560> to

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
with to and how can you use the dice to

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.569 
with to and how can you use the dice to
get<00:01:45.069> those<00:01:45.249> numbers<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.909> use<00:01:46.569> six<00:01:47.069> minus<00:01:48.069> four

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
get those numbers I use six minus four

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.209 
get those numbers I use six minus four
so<00:01:49.450> anytime<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.170> that's<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.499> subtraction

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
so anytime so that's a subtraction

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.580 
so anytime so that's a subtraction
yes<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.359> you<00:01:52.450> can<00:01:52.569> use<00:01:52.689> subtraction<00:01:53.289> what<00:01:53.409> else

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
yes so you can use subtraction what else

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.510 
yes so you can use subtraction what else
could<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.859> use<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.840> just<00:01:56.520> use<00:01:57.520> normal<00:01:58.179> numbers

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
could you use to just use normal numbers

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.919 
could you use to just use normal numbers
well<00:02:00.520> you're<00:02:00.819> getting<00:02:00.999> over<00:02:01.090> some<00:02:01.329> getting

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
well you're getting over some getting

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.529 
well you're getting over some getting
over<00:02:02.170> some<00:02:02.350> easy<00:02:02.530> numbers<00:02:02.679> with<00:02:03.219> no<00:02:03.579> it's

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
over some easy numbers with no it's

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.239 
over some easy numbers with no it's
quite<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.869> kids<00:02:05.020> roll<00:02:05.229> cuz<00:02:05.560> you're<00:02:05.709> six<00:02:05.950> minus

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
quite the kids roll cuz you're six minus

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.469 
quite the kids roll cuz you're six minus
four

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
four

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.010 
four
boys<00:02:07.810> would<00:02:08.200> go<00:02:08.379> and<00:02:08.679> say<00:02:08.920> oh<00:02:09.360> ye<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.720> will

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
boys would go and say oh ye I will

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:21.660 
boys would go and say oh ye I will
donate<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:17.940> 5<00:02:18.940> divided<00:02:19.450> by<00:02:19.599> 5<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.459> 1

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
donate to 5 divided by 5 is 1

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.660 
donate to 5 divided by 5 is 1
yeah<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.480> 1<00:02:22.989> plus<00:02:23.260> 1<00:02:23.709> equals<00:02:23.980> 2

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
yeah and 1 plus 1 equals 2

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.690 
yeah and 1 plus 1 equals 2
yeah<00:02:24.940> what<00:02:25.209> about<00:02:25.300> seven<00:02:25.720> minus<00:02:25.989> five<00:02:26.170> though

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
yeah what about seven minus five though

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.309 
yeah what about seven minus five though
that<00:02:27.700> also<00:02:27.910> looks<00:02:30.330> yeah<00:02:31.330> isn't<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.750> sometimes

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
that also looks yeah isn't it sometimes

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
you really need to look for a simpler

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.089 
you really need to look for a simpler
solution<00:02:37.120> say<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.019> can<00:02:38.170> add<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:39.069> can

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
solution say so you can add you can

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.729 
solution say so you can add you can
subtract<00:02:39.880> yes<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:41.319> won't<00:02:41.470> do<00:02:41.739> that

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
subtract yes you won't do that

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.020 
subtract yes you won't do that
you<00:02:44.739> can<00:02:44.860> go<00:02:45.010> either<00:02:45.190> way<00:02:45.310> down<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.730> path

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you can go either way down that path

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.870 
you can go either way down that path
right<00:02:46.450> yes<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.709> then<00:02:47.890> left<00:02:48.099> of<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> dice<00:02:48.610> just

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
right yes and then left of the dice just

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.000 
right yes and then left of the dice just
think<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.269> use<00:02:49.510> yeah<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.769> you're<00:02:50.920> moving

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
think you use yeah so you're moving

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.470 
think you use yeah so you're moving
along<00:02:51.310> now<00:02:51.489> show<00:02:51.670> me<00:02:51.700> as<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:51.970> get<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.209> some<00:02:52.390> of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
along now show me as you get to some of

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.140 
along now show me as you get to some of
those<00:02:52.540> tough<00:02:52.750> numbers<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.099> 15<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.700> 19<00:02:54.849> see

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
those tough numbers like a 15 and 19 see

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.680 
those tough numbers like a 15 and 19 see
your<00:02:55.269> green<00:02:55.480> again<00:02:55.750> go<00:02:55.930> ahead<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.230> roll<00:02:57.690> maybe

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
your green again go ahead and roll maybe

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.809 
your green again go ahead and roll maybe
you<00:02:58.840> gotta<00:02:58.989> get<00:02:59.110> over<00:02:59.200> 15<00:02:59.799> and<00:02:59.920> they're<00:03:00.010> 19

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
you gotta get over 15 and they're 19

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:11.470 
you gotta get over 15 and they're 19
let's<00:03:01.390> see<00:03:01.540> if<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.720> can<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.459> okay<00:03:04.530> so

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.369 

great<00:03:12.640> trying<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.849> seat<00:03:14.270> you're<00:03:15.020> trying<00:03:15.319> to

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
great trying to seat you're trying to

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.860 
great trying to seat you're trying to
calculate<00:03:15.879> why<00:03:16.879> are<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.120> thinking<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:17.569> hard

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
calculate why are you thinking so hard

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.220 
calculate why are you thinking so hard
cuz<00:03:18.200> you've<00:03:18.379> got<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.620> 15<00:03:19.190> right<00:03:19.400> there<00:03:19.840> 7<00:03:20.840> plus<00:03:21.050> 6

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
cuz you've got a 15 right there 7 plus 6

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.050 
cuz you've got a 15 right there 7 plus 6
plus<00:03:21.470> 2x<00:03:22.099> so<00:03:22.519> what<00:03:22.670> else<00:03:22.819> you're<00:03:23.030> thinking

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
plus 2x so what else you're thinking

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.540 
plus 2x so what else you're thinking
about<00:03:23.480> I'm<00:03:24.050> thinking<00:03:24.560> if<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.920> could<00:03:25.129> do<00:03:25.280> another

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
about I'm thinking if I could do another

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.009 
about I'm thinking if I could do another
way<00:03:25.879> that<00:03:26.180> maybe<00:03:27.019> be<00:03:27.290> able<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.590> get<00:03:27.800> off<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:28.160> 19

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
way that maybe be able to get off on 19

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.770 
way that maybe be able to get off on 19
may<00:03:30.019> get<00:03:30.410> over<00:03:30.650> 19<00:03:31.130> with<00:03:31.370> these<00:03:31.750> calculate<00:03:32.750> a

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
may get over 19 with these calculate a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.370 
may get over 19 with these calculate a
little<00:03:33.140> bit<00:03:33.319> more<00:03:33.620> oh<00:03:34.450> well<00:03:35.450> what<00:03:35.630> about<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.900> 7
