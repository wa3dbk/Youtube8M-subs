matter because they'll all end up making
the<00:01:02.070> same<00:01:02.280> thing<00:01:02.550> some<00:01:03.480> people<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.870> elastic

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the same thing some people like elastic

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.399 
the same thing some people like elastic
because<00:01:04.710> i<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.070> stretches<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> i<00:01:07.229> guess

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
because i think it stretches so i guess

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469

after you're done tie it off and you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.160 
after you're done tie it off and you
don't<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.290> untie<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.710> ever<00:01:11.010> again<00:01:11.310> I

don't have to untie it ever again I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.870 
don't have to untie it ever again I
don't<00:01:13.170> use<00:01:13.409> elastic<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.310> that's<00:01:14.700> not

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
don't use elastic because that's not

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
better it will be because if it's too

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.990 
better it will be because if it's too
long<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.420> cut<00:02:12.690> off

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
long you just have to cut off

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.860 
long you just have to cut off
the<00:02:13.240> ends<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.100> it's<00:02:15.250> too<00:02:15.310> small<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.540> you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the ends but if it's too small and you

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.350 
the ends but if it's too small and you
have<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.230> stop<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.920> get<00:02:18.280> any<00:02:18.490> peace<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.090> start

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
have to stop and get any peace and start

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.200 
have to stop and get any peace and start
over<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:21.190> these<00:02:21.400> are<00:02:21.580> easy<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.910> take<00:02:22.060> apart

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
over so and these are easy to take apart

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.450 
over so and these are easy to take apart
but<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:22.780> not<00:02:22.870> fun<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.290> redo<00:02:23.710> so<00:02:26.280> let's<00:02:27.280> get

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
but it's not fun to redo so let's get

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
little over it so you want to make sure

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.840 
little over it so you want to make sure
that<00:03:19.060> when<00:03:19.299> you're<00:03:19.420> doing<00:03:19.720> this<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:21.549> want<00:03:21.730> the

that when you're doing this you want the
to<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.510> lacing<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.790> at<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.299> stern<00:03:25.510> side<00:03:25.750> you

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
to the lacing to at the stern side you

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.479 
to the lacing to at the stern side you
want<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.170> put<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.410> through<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.680> holes<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.459> that

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
want to put it through the holes so that

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.250 
want to put it through the holes so that
it<00:03:27.730> makes<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.750> goes<00:03:28.870> over<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.230> top

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
it makes that it goes over the top

it makes that it goes over the top
otherwise<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.130> next<00:03:30.459> step<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.880> won't<00:03:31.060> work

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
otherwise this next step it won't work

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.460 
otherwise this next step it won't work
so<00:03:33.070> now<00:03:33.850> you're<00:03:34.299> going<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.690> take<00:03:34.870> your<00:03:34.930> second

intersection type of hole because you're

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.550 
intersection type of hole because you're
going<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> put<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> second<00:03:40.720> pop<00:03:40.870> tab<00:03:41.110> under

bottom<00:05:01.210> hole<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.569> instead<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.080> like<00:05:02.349> on<00:05:02.560> the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
bottom hole so instead of like on the

bottom hole so instead of like on the
first<00:05:03.389> first<00:05:04.389> and<00:05:04.629> second<00:05:04.960> steps<00:05:05.199> it<00:05:05.349> was

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:05.439 
first first and second steps it was

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
taught to top and bottom to bottom but

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.800 
taught to top and bottom to bottom but
when<00:05:08.439> you're<00:05:08.590> making<00:05:08.949> your<00:05:08.979> ex<00:05:09.279> its<00:05:09.819> top<00:05:10.479> to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
bottom and bottom to top so you take

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.790 
bottom and bottom to top so you take
your<00:05:15.550> top<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:16.330> string<00:05:16.779> or<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.169> top<00:05:17.500> hole

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
your top the string or to the top hole

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.129 
your top the string or to the top hole
and<00:05:18.159> you<00:05:18.189> put<00:05:19.089> that<00:05:19.300> one<00:05:19.509> through<00:05:19.689> the<00:05:19.779> bottom

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
and you put that one through the bottom

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.200 
and you put that one through the bottom
then<00:05:21.009> you<00:05:21.099> take<00:05:21.310> this<00:05:21.699> string<00:05:21.939> that<00:05:22.029> went

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
then you take this string that went

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.489 
then you take this string that went
through<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.389> bottom<00:05:22.719> hole<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.229> put<00:05:23.409> it

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:23.499 
through the bottom hole and put it

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.600 
through the bottom hole and put it
through<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.069> top<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:26.740> then<00:05:26.889> you'll<00:05:27.009> make<00:05:27.189> an<00:05:27.339> X

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
through the top so then you'll make an X

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:35.100 
through the top so then you'll make an X
so<00:05:28.270> it'll<00:05:28.539> look<00:05:28.569> like<00:05:32.009> just<00:05:33.009> like<00:05:33.219> that<00:05:34.110> you're

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
so it'll look like just like that you're

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.510 
so it'll look like just like that you're
finished<00:05:35.379> product<00:05:35.800> will<00:05:35.949> look<00:05:36.009> like<00:05:36.310> this
