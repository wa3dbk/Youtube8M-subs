townhall 8
war<00:00:23.550> basses<00:00:24.180> now<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.810> anti<00:00:25.170> three-star

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
war basses now these are anti three-star

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.250 
war basses now these are anti three-star
bases<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.599> good<00:00:27.869> designs

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
bases so these are really good designs

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.529 
bases so these are really good designs
to<00:00:28.560> use<00:00:28.859> if<00:00:29.250> you're<00:00:29.730> either<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.359> very

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
to use if you're either in a very

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.060 
to use if you're either in a very
competitive<00:00:30.929> clan<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.470> gets<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> lot<00:00:32.040> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
competitive clan that gets a lot of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.150 
competitive clan that gets a lot of
three-star<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.210> three-star<00:00:33.660> temps<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.290> if

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
three-star up a three-star temps or if

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.549 
three-star up a three-star temps or if
you<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> new<00:00:36.239> town<00:00:36.600> hall<00:00:36.750> 9<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.350> way<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you are a new town hall 9 that way you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.560 
you are a new town hall 9 that way you
won't<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.100> three-star<00:00:38.730> door<00:00:39.000> hopefully<00:00:39.390> not

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
won't be three-star door hopefully not

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.040 
won't be three-star door hopefully not
at<00:00:39.690> least

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
at least

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.720 
at least
so<00:00:40.410> let's<00:00:40.559> without<00:00:40.920> further<00:00:41.100> ado<00:00:41.370> let's<00:00:41.579> get

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so let's without further ado let's get

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940 
so let's without further ado let's get
to<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:42.450> bases<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.320> here's<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> first

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to the two bases here here's the first

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.479 
to the two bases here here's the first
one

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
one

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.310 
one
now<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.239> base<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:45.989> bit

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
now this base is a little bit

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
now this base is a little bit
interesting<00:00:46.829> looking<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> does<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
interesting looking as it does have the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.900 
interesting looking as it does have the
the<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.110> units<00:00:49.469> spread<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.460> long<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the all the units spread out long the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.520 
the all the units spread out long the
edges<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> make<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> little<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.020> harder<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
edges and make it a little bit harder to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.119 
edges and make it a little bit harder to
go<00:00:52.920> ahead<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.489> direct<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:54.210> troops<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.129> for

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
go ahead and direct your troops and for

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.729 
go ahead and direct your troops and for
an<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.820> inexperienced<00:00:57.300> attacker<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
an for an inexperienced attacker the the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
an for an inexperienced attacker the the
funneling<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.180> bit<00:01:00.390> difficult

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
funneling can be a little bit difficult

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
funneling can be a little bit difficult
on<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> base<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> have

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
on a base like this now you will I have

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.660 
on a base like this now you will I have
to<00:01:03.359> apologize<00:01:03.930> real<00:01:04.350> quickly<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:05.070> level<00:01:05.430> 1

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
to apologize real quickly for my level 1

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
to apologize real quickly for my level 1
walls<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> am<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> brand<00:01:07.049> new<00:01:07.260> town<00:01:07.950> hall<00:01:08.250> 9

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
walls but I am a brand new town hall 9

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
walls but I am a brand new town hall 9
base<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> baby<00:01:10.500> ash<00:01:10.740> account

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
base so this is the baby ash account

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.469 
base so this is the baby ash account
right<00:01:11.280> now<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> went<00:01:11.909> ahead<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> made<00:01:12.299> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
right now so I went ahead and made these

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.399 
right now so I went ahead and made these
two<00:01:12.720> bases

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
two bases

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
two bases
I<00:01:13.439> found<00:01:14.159> these<00:01:14.340> bases<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.850> designed<00:01:15.210> them

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I found these bases and designed them

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880 
I found these bases and designed them
myself<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.900> did<00:01:16.049> switch<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.409> few<00:01:16.530> things<00:01:16.740> around

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
myself I did switch a few things around

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
myself I did switch a few things around
but<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> found<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.270> bases<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.900> Chinese

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
but I found these bases from a Chinese

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.580 
but I found these bases from a Chinese
clan<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.799> Ward<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.630> few<00:01:21.630> wars<00:01:21.869> ago<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.500> we

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
clan that we Ward a few wars ago that we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
clan that we Ward a few wars ago that we
had<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.799> lot<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> difficulty<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.640> these<00:01:23.820> bases

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
had a lot of difficulty with these bases

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
had a lot of difficulty with these bases
they<00:01:24.479> were<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.350> think<00:01:25.710> seven<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
they were they one I think seven and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
they were they one I think seven and
eight<00:01:26.640> defensive<00:01:27.270> winds<00:01:27.509> respectively<00:01:28.259> now

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
eight defensive winds respectively now

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
eight defensive winds respectively now
this<00:01:28.950> base<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.150> Town<00:01:30.540> Hall<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this base you can see the Town Hall the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.749 
this base you can see the Town Hall the
clan<00:01:31.229> castle<00:01:31.409> rather<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.009> centralized

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
clan castle rather is centralized

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.390 
clan castle rather is centralized
it<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.450> lauraball<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:35.159> something

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
it is lauraball which is not something

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950 
it is lauraball which is not something
you<00:01:35.490> normally<00:01:35.670> see<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.180> anti<00:01:36.450> three-star

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
you normally see on anti three-star

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
you normally see on anti three-star
design<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.310> tell<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.850> for

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
design but I can tell you that for

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.700 
design but I can tell you that for
whatever<00:01:39.299> reason<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.840> mechanics<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.439> work

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
whatever reason the mechanics just work

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.499 
whatever reason the mechanics just work
out<00:01:40.920> pretty<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.670> base<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.360> give

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
out pretty well with this base so give

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
out pretty well with this base so give
it<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.659> shot<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.009> archer

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it a shot see what you think the archer

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
it a shot see what you think the archer
Queen<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.579> relatively<00:01:45.060> hard<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
Queen is relatively hard to get to the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.710 
Queen is relatively hard to get to the
clan<00:01:47.100> castle<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.640> protected<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> center

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
clan castle also protected in the center

so<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:04.020> why<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> first<00:02:05.250> well<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.509> can

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
so that's why for the first well you can

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.410 
so that's why for the first well you can
almost<00:02:06.840> always<00:02:07.140> defend<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.280> first<00:02:08.819> attack<00:02:09.209> if

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
almost always defend the first attack if

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.339 
almost always defend the first attack if
it's<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.840> hole

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it's a go hole

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's a go hole
we<00:02:10.679> attack<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.910> ahead<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.480> swap

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
we attack if you go ahead and you swap

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.730 
we attack if you go ahead and you swap
these<00:02:13.200> little

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.830 
giant bombs are up in the north here it
might<00:02:20.460> be<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.640> little<00:02:20.880> bit<00:02:21.000> more<00:02:21.150> difficult<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
might be a little bit more difficult to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.810 
might be a little bit more difficult to
defend<00:02:22.470> because<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:23.460> ahead<00:02:23.580> and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
defend because you can go ahead and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.670 
defend because you can go ahead and
execute<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.210> attack<00:02:24.510> from<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.870> north<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.380> a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
execute your attack from the north but a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.810 
execute your attack from the north but a
lot<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.890> people<00:02:26.070> are<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.370> assume<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
lot of people are going to assume the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.430 
lot of people are going to assume the
giant<00:02:27.120> bombs<00:02:27.300> are<00:02:27.480> either<00:02:27.630> over<00:02:28.050> here<00:02:28.290> where

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
giant bombs are either over here where

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.900 
giant bombs are either over here where
they<00:02:28.530> actually<00:02:28.710> are<00:02:28.920> next<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.490> town<00:02:29.670> hall

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
they actually are next to the town hall

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.240 
they actually are next to the town hall
and<00:02:30.140> over<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.560> where<00:02:31.770> all<00:02:31.890> these<00:02:32.010> little

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and over here where all these little

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.160 
and over here where all these little
bombs<00:02:32.490> are<00:02:32.790> or<00:02:33.060> over<00:02:33.570> here<00:02:33.810> because<00:02:34.020> only

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
bombs are or over here because only

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.620 
bombs are or over here because only
three<00:02:34.650> obvious<00:02:35.220> spots<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.790> giant<00:02:36.120> bombs<00:02:36.300> in

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
three obvious spots for giant bombs in

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.320 
three obvious spots for giant bombs in
this<00:02:36.840> base<00:02:37.220> but<00:02:38.220> for<00:02:38.490> sure<00:02:38.730> for<00:02:38.910> shattered

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
this base but for sure for shattered

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.940 
this base but for sure for shattered
golaloon<00:02:39.690> attacks<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> pretty<00:02:40.560> good<00:02:40.740> base

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
golaloon attacks is a pretty good base

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.310 
golaloon attacks is a pretty good base
see<00:02:41.850> how<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.150> see<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.110> try

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
see how you see what you think of it try

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.570 
see how you see what you think of it try
it<00:02:43.350> out<00:02:43.530> let<00:02:43.710> me<00:02:43.740> know<00:02:43.830> what<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.100> think<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
it out let me know what you think and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.450 
it out let me know what you think and
let's<00:02:45.240> move<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.110> second<00:02:46.710> base<00:02:46.920> here

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
let's move on to the second base here

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.870 
let's move on to the second base here
cancel<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.920> second<00:02:50.280> base<00:02:50.460> I<00:02:50.640> might

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
cancel that and the second base I might

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.940 
cancel that and the second base I might
like<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.210> one<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.510> little<00:02:51.660> bit<00:02:51.780> better<00:02:52.050> so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
like this one a little bit better so

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.300 
like this one a little bit better so
here<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.260> another<00:02:55.440> design<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.280> I

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
here it is this is another design that I

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.850 
here it is this is another design that I
got<00:02:56.820> from<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.120> Chinese<00:02:57.420> clan<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.170> once<00:02:58.560> again

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
got from a Chinese clan and I once again

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.730 
got from a Chinese clan and I once again
I<00:02:59.070> altered<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.760> few<00:03:00.000> things<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.290> really<00:03:01.530> like

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
I altered a few things so I really like

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.770 
I altered a few things so I really like
it<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> giant<00:03:02.310> bombs<00:03:02.460> are<00:03:02.670> facing<00:03:03.120> relatively

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it the giant bombs are facing relatively

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.420 
it the giant bombs are facing relatively
different<00:03:03.960> directions<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:05.040> they're

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
different directions so and they're

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.980 
different directions so and they're
pretty<00:03:05.640> well<00:03:05.760> protected<00:03:05.970> for<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.480> most<00:03:06.720> part

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
pretty well protected for the most part

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.620 
pretty well protected for the most part
you<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.830> air<00:03:08.010> sweepers<00:03:08.550> facing<00:03:09.060> west

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
you have the air sweepers facing west

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.930 
you have the air sweepers facing west
and<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.110> facing<00:03:10.590> east<00:03:10.830> up<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.820> you're

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
and then facing east up here so you're

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.820 
and then facing east up here so you're
covering<00:03:12.300> both<00:03:12.600> all<00:03:12.900> four<00:03:13.200> air<00:03:13.350> defenses

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
covering both all four air defenses

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.920 
covering both all four air defenses
pretty<00:03:14.460> much<00:03:14.700> with<00:03:14.910> those<00:03:15.000> two<00:03:15.240> air<00:03:15.450> sweepers

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
pretty much with those two air sweepers

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.870 
pretty much with those two air sweepers
now<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.770> clan<00:03:17.010> castle<00:03:17.220> here<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
now you have the clan castle here that

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090 
now you have the clan castle here that
is<00:03:18.000> impossible<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.990> lure<00:03:19.200> unless<00:03:19.920> you're

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
is impossible to lure unless you're

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
is impossible to lure unless you're
going<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.250> use<00:03:20.310> quite<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> few<00:03:21.150> balloons<00:03:21.570> or

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
going to use quite a few balloons or

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.810 
going to use quite a few balloons or
hogs<00:03:22.110> as<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.980> see<00:03:23.130> there's<00:03:23.310> at<00:03:23.400> least<00:03:23.430> one

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
hogs as you can see there's at least one

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.570 
hogs as you can see there's at least one
defensive<00:03:24.270> unit<00:03:24.660> outside<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.830> range<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.520> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
dark elixir storage so there you go all

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.180 
dark elixir storage so there you go all
the<00:03:57.630> fundamentals<00:03:58.170> are<00:03:58.350> there<00:03:58.590> obviously<00:03:59.100> the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
the fundamentals are there obviously the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.920 
the fundamentals are there obviously the
spring<00:03:59.520> traps<00:03:59.820> in<00:04:00.000> between<00:04:00.270> obvious<00:04:00.690> hog

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
spring traps in between obvious hog

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.080 
spring traps in between obvious hog
locations<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:02.130> it's<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.310> pretty<00:04:02.490> solid<00:04:02.730> base

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
locations so it's a pretty solid base

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.160 
locations so it's a pretty solid base
whether<00:04:03.390> golaloon<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.810> obviously<00:04:06.810> I

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
whether golaloon and and obviously I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.130 
whether golaloon and and obviously I
should<00:04:07.770> go<00:04:08.040> home<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.460> attack<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.330> hope<00:04:10.020> you

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
should go home I attack so I hope you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.560 
should go home I attack so I hope you
