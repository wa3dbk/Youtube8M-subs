00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.769
 in this video we see how they move 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.419
 the chess pieces we say in a manner 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.760
 maths 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.980
 then we move from the Cartesian plane 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.950
 two-dimensional reference system 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.860
 introduced the map around the seventeenth century 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.930
 to a portion of the plan the chessboard 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.520
 actually considered as a model 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.010
 discrete of this portion of the plan 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.039
 each box is marked with a 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.779
 letter and a number but replacing the 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.180
 letters of the horizontal with numbers 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.050
 here we have numerical coordinates of 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.600
 which is important 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.390
 order we take a piece of the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.399
 chess the bishop we position on 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.649
 box of its board 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:50.110
 position given by primonumero the split 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.120
 x4 do number the ordinate y equal to 5 in 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.920
 this way every box is now 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.430
 marked with two numbers ordered 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.809
 from the starting position 45 the standard bearer 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.320
 fashions but let's try to understand how it is 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.450
 moves 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.090
 let's remember the bishop on the chessboard 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.630
 the bishop moves exclusively into 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.570
 diagonal and to stay in the world of 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.979
 chessboard will always have ordered splits 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.960
 anyway including equals between one and eight 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.180
 examples in the first shift taken in 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.530
 consideration of the new position given 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 from hashish first equal to hicks peuterey 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.869
 ordered y first equals y plus three 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.790
 according to the new position is given by 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:42.939
 abscissa I express equal to hicks minus 3 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.070
 ordered y first gualerzi a minus 3 in the 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.579
 third move the new position 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.549
 given by ics first trouble and x4 y first 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.770
 equal to y minus 4 fourth and last 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.110
 moving for example the new one 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.869
 position is given by equal first ics 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.060
 hicks minus 3y first equal y peuterey 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.460
 general from the starting position o 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.629
 a variation of the aics of the split 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.459
 equal to this of the tax or a variation 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:18.310
 of the ordinate equal to delta ypsilon 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.890
 but then if both ics and la changes 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.890
 ypsilon what it is that does not change 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:29.409
 we move the bishop along the first one 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:34.000
 diagonal first upwards from the point 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:36.840
 45 the bishop arrives in 78 the x and the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.970
 ypsilon increase by three 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 similarly the bishop when he moves 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 at the bottom of point 4 5 arrives in 12 ad 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.940
 example the x and the ypsilon decrease by 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.190
 three that along the first diagonal or le 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.290
 its parallels what does not change is the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.549
 relationship between delta ypsilon and delta iv 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.150
 or the incremental ratio equal to 1 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.640
 let's change diagonal 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.690
 the bishop first moves down from the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.730
 point 45 the bishop arrives at point 81 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.840
 while the ics increases by 4 the ypsilon 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.500
 decreases by 4 similarly shifting 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.380
 the bishop upward from point 45 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.049
 the bishop arrives in 18 while the ics 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.400
 decreases by three the ypsilon increases by 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.560
 3 therefore also along the second 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.200
 diagonal or its parallels what not 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.569
 change is the relationship between delta ypsilon e 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.459
 delta hicks or the report 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.780
 incremental in this case less 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.599
 one we have found therefore in variant 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.129
 of the bishop that is the relationship 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.900
 incrementally constantly equal to plus or 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.370
 minus one 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.370
 now it's up to you and have fun
