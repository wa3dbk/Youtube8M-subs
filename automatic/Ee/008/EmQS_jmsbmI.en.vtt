00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.330 

first<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.640> shred<00:00:48.910> head<00:00:49.120> without<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
first the shred head without the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:08.100 
first the shred head without the
microwave

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:26.969 

now<00:01:09.110> with<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.440> micro

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.319 

next<00:01:27.979> we're<00:01:28.100> going<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.280> try<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.610> beyond<00:01:29.060> my

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
next we're going to try the beyond my

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:47.950 
next we're going to try the beyond my
driver<00:01:30.369> yes<00:01:31.369> going<00:01:31.640> first<00:01:32.390> without<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.899> micro

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:02:17.890 

now<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> microlab

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.970 

now<00:02:18.900> we're<00:02:19.050> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> try<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.440> microwave

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
now we're going to try the microwave

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.150 
now we're going to try the microwave
just<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.640> micro<00:02:20.910> abalone<00:02:21.770> let's<00:02:22.770> see<00:02:22.920> what<00:02:23.070> we

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
just a micro abalone let's see what we

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.790 
just a micro abalone let's see what we
can<00:02:23.190> do<00:02:25.190> now<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> move<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> settings<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.800> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
can do now I move the settings up to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:43.559 
can do now I move the settings up to
three<00:02:29.400> o'clock

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:51.150 

so

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:01.680 

so<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:51.910> without<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.570> microwave<00:03:00.690> now

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
so this is without the microwave now

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:32.470 
so this is without the microwave now
with<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> microwave

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.550 

so<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.690> was<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:35.000> mxr<00:03:37.550> microgram
