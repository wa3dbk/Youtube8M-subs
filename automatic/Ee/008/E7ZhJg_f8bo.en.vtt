00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
you might be wondering why it only has

eight gigabytes of internal storage but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
eight gigabytes of internal storage but
that<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> Amazon<00:00:44.160> Kindle<00:00:44.489> Fire

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that is because the Amazon Kindle Fire

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
that is because the Amazon Kindle Fire
is<00:00:44.879> built<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.390> most<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.350> content<00:00:46.680> is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
is built so most of your content is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
is built so most of your content is
going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.070> stored<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.610> Amazon<00:00:48.329> servers<00:00:48.870> so

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
going to be stored on Amazon servers so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
going to be stored on Amazon servers so
a<00:00:49.350> lot<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.739> content<00:00:50.070> really<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
a lot of your content really is going to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.580 
a lot of your content really is going to
be<00:00:50.730> stored<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> actual<00:00:51.449> device<00:00:51.780> which<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
be stored on the actual device which is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
be stored on the actual device which is
the<00:00:52.710> reason<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:52.980> only<00:00:53.219> having<00:00:53.430> 8<00:00:53.730> gigabytes

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the reason for only having 8 gigabytes

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
the reason for only having 8 gigabytes
of<00:00:54.210> storage<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.500> that's<00:00:55.680> pretty<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.070> as

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
of storage but that's pretty much it as

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.799 
of storage but that's pretty much it as
far<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.579> specs<00:00:56.850> pricing<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
far as specs pricing all that kind of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.119 
far as specs pricing all that kind of
stuff<00:00:57.870> goes<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> guys<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.100> probably

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
pull this out and let's figure out how

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.690 
pull this out and let's figure out how
we<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.850> into<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:17.479> all<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:19.700> this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
we can get into this all right this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.820 
we can get into this all right this
thing<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:21.000> slide<00:01:21.299> off<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.840> okay<00:01:22.439> we've<00:01:22.650> got

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
thing will slide off here okay we've got

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.490 
thing will slide off here okay we've got
a<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.369> tape<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> let's<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.380> we

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
a little bit of tape so let's see if we

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
a little bit of tape so let's see if we
can<00:01:26.780> pop<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.810> off<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:31.670> there<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
can pop that off here we go and there we

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.670 
can pop that off here we go and there we
go<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> business<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.530> lay

go now we are in business go and lay
this<00:01:34.829> aside<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:37.040> then<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.490> off<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.820> bat

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this aside and then right off the bat

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.319 
this aside and then right off the bat
we've<00:01:39.540> got<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.140> Kindle<00:01:41.040> Fire<00:01:41.250> will<00:01:42.119> take<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
look at that in just one second let's go

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
look at that in just one second let's go
and<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.579> what<00:01:44.700> else<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> box<00:01:45.570> and
