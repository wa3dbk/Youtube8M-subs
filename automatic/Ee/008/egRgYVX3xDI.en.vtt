00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.319
 high tech 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.340
 nick foligno match in the cup against 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.110
 koksijde 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.379
 we will read this weekend at 8 am 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.900
 it's a displacement always there are 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.029
 reasons for that I think the read 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 it's a solid team defensively and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.060
 at home in front of their audience that is 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 therefore supports it is true that what is 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.670
 difficult to play or in the as they 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.289
 remain on 6 draws a win 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.300
 a defeat so it'll be difficult 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 to go and win there 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.329
 but the lily lost in the cup 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.120
 maybe there is still a little bit of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.469
 disappointment in the ranks to read yes 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.030
 that's for sure that in my opinion are disappointed but 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.379
 good it's the championship it's different 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.300
 so I think they're going to have to heart 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.680
 to not just get up from the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.520
 cut for to win against us so 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.520
 it's going to be a very difficult match 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 known 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 Yes 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.340
 we have to lift me took a very start 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.310
 very well in the cup as we won 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.170
 in the competition in the top 6 that's 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.390
 certainly for a motivation but 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.740
 it's also already an end a goal for 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.170
 zulte-waregem where it's still too early 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 of pale tones and not to think a little 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.240
 too early to talk about it 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.980
 the main thing is to take a match after 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.840
 match we stay the longest the 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.730
 top 6 for us and we'll see later 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.810
 but already it goes through a result this 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.940
 weekend or read what you saw 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.700
 power arises is the one that this 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.770
 Wednesday for the cup match is 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.020
 what there is a jonathan more fresh 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.820
 now where we can not talk that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.010
 we'll see tomorrow I hope so 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.440
 unfairly the coach put a few 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.880
 players rested on Wednesday played it 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.650
 a lot of young people so here is now 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.450
 it's going to be showing us that we are 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.580
 present tomorrow I ask this question 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.690
 because I saw after training 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.270
 Friday 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.570
 now that you're with Antonenko 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.430
 will win over the chasms and yeah 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.650
 well, we did some centers 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.540
 that's why for the match tomorrow here 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.690
 to get in shape of small 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.410
 prognosis for tomorrow yeah I would say to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.410
 the e3 to ask the
