for<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> decide<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.280> be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
for this just decide which one would be

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.469 
for this just decide which one would be
the<00:01:23.490> front<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> which<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.210> would<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the front and which one would be the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
the front and which one would be the

his nose
and<00:02:13.860> what<00:02:14.040> I'm<00:02:14.130> gonna<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.520> I'm<00:02:14.640> gonna<00:02:14.700> take

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
my brown paint and I'm just gonna trace

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.540 
my brown paint and I'm just gonna trace
over<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.380> I'll<00:02:19.500> use<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.950> toothpick

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
over that for that I'll use a toothpick

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.370 
over that for that I'll use a toothpick
now<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.540> dip<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.410> my<00:02:22.560> brown<00:02:22.860> paint<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
then I'll just trace over the little

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.870 
then I'll just trace over the little
picture<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.630> nose<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.050> drew<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.890> just

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
picture of the nose that I drew I just

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.020 
picture of the nose that I drew I just
find<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.269> little<00:02:30.420> easier<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.050> way<00:02:32.030> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
find it a little easier that way and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.540 
find it a little easier that way and
then<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.209> fill<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:34.010> there<00:02:35.010> we<00:02:35.099> go<00:02:35.250> have

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
then I fill it in there we go have

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.520 
then I fill it in there we go have
little<00:02:35.880> nose<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.080> little<00:02:37.290> arch

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
little nose and then the little arch

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.030 
little nose and then the little arch
above<00:02:38.040> his<00:02:38.250> nose<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.700> actually<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.780> crease<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
above his nose is actually the crease of

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.860 
above his nose is actually the crease of
his<00:02:41.880> nose<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.569> I'll<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:42.840> draw<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.319> into

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
his nose so I'll just draw that into

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.009 
his nose so I'll just draw that into
he's<00:02:45.870> drawing<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.350> little<00:02:46.590> crease<00:02:47.720> there<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:48.840> go

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
he's drawing a little crease there we go

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.620 
he's drawing a little crease there we go
and<00:02:49.260> then<00:02:49.769> I'll<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.040> eye<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.910> either<00:02:51.180> side

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and then I'll do one eye on either side

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.660 
and then I'll do one eye on either side
of<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.290> then<00:02:52.830> I'll<00:02:52.950> draw<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.220> his<00:02:53.400> little

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
of that and then I'll draw in his little

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.870 
of that and then I'll draw in his little
eyebrows<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.709> now<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> painted<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.760> his

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880
