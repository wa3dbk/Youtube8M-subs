ready<00:00:15.519> to<00:00:15.840> drill<00:00:16.840> your<00:00:17.290> keg<00:00:17.800> when<00:00:18.099> you're

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
ready to drill your keg when you're

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.439 
ready to drill your keg when you're
making<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:18.730> cake<00:00:19.420> kettle<00:00:20.140> keg<00:00:20.470> goal<00:00:20.650> conversion

making a cake kettle keg goal conversion

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
making a cake kettle keg goal conversion
so<00:00:22.449> these<00:00:23.109> are<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.289> tools<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:23.619> we<00:00:23.770> use

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
so these are the tools that we use

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.340 
so these are the tools that we use
you're<00:00:25.119> gonna<00:00:25.210> need<00:00:25.359> a<00:00:25.420> drill<00:00:25.810> whether<00:00:26.260> a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
you're gonna need a drill whether a

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.410 
you're gonna need a drill whether a
corded<00:00:26.830> or<00:00:26.949> cordless<00:00:27.010> it's<00:00:27.580> not<00:00:27.730> gonna<00:00:27.820> matter

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
corded or cordless it's not gonna matter

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.630 
corded or cordless it's not gonna matter
I<00:00:28.449> find<00:00:28.990> cordless<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:29.560> be<00:00:29.680> so<00:00:30.070> much<00:00:30.220> easier<00:00:30.250> to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
I find cordless to be so much easier to

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.630 
I find cordless to be so much easier to
use<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:31.769> sharpie<00:00:32.769> is<00:00:32.890> always<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.190> good<00:00:33.400> tool

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
use a sharpie is always a good tool

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.729 
use a sharpie is always a good tool
you're<00:00:34.390> gonna<00:00:34.510> need<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.750> tape<00:00:35.019> measure<00:00:35.260> a

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
you're gonna need a tape measure a

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.610 
you're gonna need a tape measure a
couple<00:00:36.129> Crescent<00:00:36.550> wrenches<00:00:36.610> work<00:00:36.970> just<00:00:37.239> fine

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
couple Crescent wrenches work just fine

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.979 
couple Crescent wrenches work just fine
you're<00:00:39.010> gonna<00:00:39.129> need<00:00:39.309> either<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:40.830> Unibet<00:00:42.269> or<00:00:43.269> I

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
you're gonna need either a Unibet or I

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.049 
you're gonna need either a Unibet or I
like<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.830> use<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.040> carbide<00:00:45.400> since<00:00:45.790> we<00:00:45.909> do<00:00:46.030> a

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
like to use the carbide since we do a

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.750 
like to use the carbide since we do a
lot<00:00:46.299> of<00:00:46.420> them<00:00:46.540> so<00:00:46.960> I<00:00:47.260> buy<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.650> carbide<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.430> I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
lot of them so I buy the carbide and I

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.399 
lot of them so I buy the carbide and I
think<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.120> works<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.479> little<00:00:49.629> bit<00:00:49.720> faster

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.609 

just<00:00:53.409> fine<00:00:53.589> so<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.600> do<00:00:55.659> to<00:00:55.989> get<00:00:56.559> set<00:00:56.949> up<00:00:57.129> to

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
just fine so what I do to get set up to

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.329 
just fine so what I do to get set up to
measure<00:00:59.909> what<00:01:00.909> I<00:01:00.940> do<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.299> I<00:01:01.839> actually<00:01:02.379> start<00:01:03.220> on

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
measure what I do is I actually start on

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.640 
measure what I do is I actually start on
the<00:01:03.430> inside<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.970> cake<00:01:04.180> and<00:01:04.600> just<00:01:05.409> kind<00:01:05.619> of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
the inside of the cake and just kind of

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.030 
the inside of the cake and just kind of
get<00:01:05.799> an<00:01:05.890> idea<00:01:06.420> where<00:01:07.420> this<00:01:08.140> dip<00:01:08.409> tube<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.770> going

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
get an idea where this dip tube is going

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.410 
get an idea where this dip tube is going
to<00:01:09.190> set<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:11.730> just<00:01:12.730> set<00:01:12.910> this<00:01:13.000> down<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.390> here

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
to set so I just set this down in here

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.330 
to set so I just set this down in here
it's<00:01:14.050> gonna<00:01:14.230> set<00:01:14.530> somewhere<00:01:14.920> in<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.100> middle

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
it's gonna set somewhere in the middle

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.010 
it's gonna set somewhere in the middle
you<00:01:15.430> want<00:01:15.550> it<00:01:15.700> up<00:01:15.820> about<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.150> half<00:01:16.510> an<00:01:16.720> inch<00:01:16.840> off

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
you want it up about a half an inch off

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.510 
you want it up about a half an inch off
the<00:01:17.050> bottom<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.830> found<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.400> if<00:01:18.490> you

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
the bottom so I found that if you

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.040 
the bottom so I found that if you
actually<00:01:18.760> just<00:01:19.120> push<00:01:19.330> this<00:01:19.480> right<00:01:19.720> over

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
actually just push this right over

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.070 
actually just push this right over
towards<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.440> edge<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.180> get<00:01:22.510> this<00:01:22.780> in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
towards the edge when you get this in

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.660 
towards the edge when you get this in
the<00:01:23.440> center<00:01:23.860> it's<00:01:24.040> going<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.370> be<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.490> better

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
the center it's going to be a better

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.780 
the center it's going to be a better
half<00:01:24.850> inch<00:01:25.030> off<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.720> bottom<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.790> actually

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
half inch off the bottom so actually

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.090 
half inch off the bottom so actually
take<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:31.080> what<00:01:32.080> I'm<00:01:32.140> gonna<00:01:32.260> do<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.680> I'm<00:01:33.040> just

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
take and what I'm gonna do is I'm just

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.560 
take and what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna<00:01:33.340> get<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:34.560> quick<00:01:35.560> rough<00:01:36.220> estimate<00:01:37.000> as<00:01:37.150> to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
gonna get a quick rough estimate as to

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.270 
gonna get a quick rough estimate as to
where<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:37.930> going<00:01:38.230> to<00:01:38.409> go<00:01:40.890> we're<00:01:41.890> gonna<00:01:42.010> drill

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
where it's going to go we're gonna drill

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.990 
where it's going to go we're gonna drill
this<00:01:42.370> from<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.640> outside<00:01:43.060> but<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:44.550> do<00:01:45.550> this<00:01:45.760> just

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
this from the outside but I do this just

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.660 
this from the outside but I do this just
to<00:01:46.060> make<00:01:46.240> sure<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.780> we<00:01:46.960> don't<00:01:47.250> drop<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.490> dip

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
to make sure that we don't drop the dip

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
to make sure that we don't drop the dip
tube<00:01:48.880> down<00:01:49.060> too<00:01:49.390> low

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.719 

come<00:01:53.909> off<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.539> known<00:01:56.689> spot<00:01:58.280> which<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.490> on

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
come off of a known spot which is on

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.600 
come off of a known spot which is on
this<00:01:59.939> one's<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> seam<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.610> this

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
this one's going to be the seam and this

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.120 
this one's going to be the seam and this
measures<00:02:03.090> five<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.259> quarter<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:05.039> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
measures five and a quarter from the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:21.740 
measures five and a quarter from the
scene<00:02:19.819> where<00:02:20.819> we're<00:02:21.030> actually<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
scene where we're actually going to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.570 
scene where we're actually going to
drill<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:22.620> again<00:02:23.489> here's<00:02:23.819> my<00:02:24.890> seam<00:02:25.890> five

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
drill it so again here's my seam five

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.420 
drill it so again here's my seam five
and<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.849> quarter<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.769> lot<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.040> people<00:02:29.280> like

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and a quarter and a lot of people like

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.920 
and a quarter and a lot of people like
to<00:02:29.459> measure<00:02:29.760> up<00:02:29.849> off<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> bottom<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.870> I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
to measure up off the bottom that I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.140 
to measure up off the bottom that I
found<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.650> measuring<00:02:32.519> up<00:02:32.670> off<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.970> bottom

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
found that measuring up off the bottom

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.880 
found that measuring up off the bottom
doesn't<00:02:33.690> really<00:02:33.840> work<00:02:34.049> because<00:02:34.410> all<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> kegs

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
doesn't really work because all the kegs

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.860 
doesn't really work because all the kegs
are<00:02:35.069> different<00:02:35.579> you<00:02:36.329> know<00:02:36.420> there's<00:02:36.660> several

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
are different you know there's several

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.050 
are different you know there's several
hundred<00:02:36.989> keg<00:02:37.500> manufacturers<00:02:38.250> overseas<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
hundred keg manufacturers overseas and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.990 
hundred keg manufacturers overseas and
all<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.019> bottom<00:02:40.349> rings<00:02:40.530> are<00:02:40.709> different<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:41.370> I

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
all the bottom rings are different so I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.670 
all the bottom rings are different so I
find<00:02:42.599> doing<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> little<00:02:43.440> bit<00:02:43.560> more

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
find doing this is a little bit more

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.400 
find doing this is a little bit more
accurate<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.660> works<00:02:45.660> out<00:02:46.049> always<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:48.230> then<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
accurate and works out always so then I

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.460 
accurate and works out always so then I
go<00:02:50.040> ahead<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.400> try<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.480> find<00:02:51.630> my<00:02:51.810> center<00:02:52.140> spot

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
go ahead and try and find my center spot

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.470 
go ahead and try and find my center spot
just<00:02:52.950> eyeball<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.610> mean<00:02:53.730> yeah<00:02:54.180> we're<00:02:54.390> not

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
just eyeball it I mean yeah we're not

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.640 
just eyeball it I mean yeah we're not

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
there it is there's our hole drill right

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.850 
there it is there's our hole drill right
exactly<00:03:44.700> where<00:03:44.820> we<00:03:44.940> need<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.120> for<00:03:45.840> our<00:03:45.900> weld

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
exactly where we need it for our weld

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.860 
exactly where we need it for our weld
Liske<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.380> now<00:03:49.380> let's<00:03:49.650> show<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:49.920> how<00:03:50.870> to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
Liske it and now let's show you how to

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.190 
Liske it and now let's show you how to
put<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.200> weld<00:03:52.380> Liske<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.770> in<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.190> CAG<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:54.200> how

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
put the weld Liske it in the CAG and how

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.620 
put the weld Liske it in the CAG and how
to<00:03:55.260> set<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.500> up
