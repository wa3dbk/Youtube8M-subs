00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.140
 next to me is the first oberbergischen 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.870
 clapboard claus handle in this 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.910
 film the principles of the classical 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.190
 will explain the art of riding 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.410
 this classic education in principle 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 is nothing but like the horse 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.030
 to give it time to be physically 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.879
 can develop and our career in 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.530
 The school is so that we have the horses 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.129
 at age three , three and a half that 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.809
 depends on how some already 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.149
 are developed when in school 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.920
 arrive once a week or 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.170
 two weeks where they run free in the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 hall where they worked later 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.360
 become 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.640
 later it will be started with the saddle 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.070
 and then already where the horse is slowly whole 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.649
 long is tied off so we do that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.259
 horse slowly reinkriegt in a frame 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.259
 then a really long work begins 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.500
 We will now be explaining correctly 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.090
 that's always trouble too 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.979
 Most riders change gears and 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.470
 then the horse or disturb yourself 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.350
 that's a nice sweeping kick 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.080
 You can see how the back leg is built in the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.130
 footsteps of advantage when a horse 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.869
 The ship is like it is now, for example 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.899
 i have my shoulder on the ruled 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.340
 bit setting left for and 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.440
 so the horse just right i try 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.390
 to touch the backhand and try 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:06.080
 it while he lifts that up and now 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.030
 rewards that one starts at the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.280
 Handwork time lets that can take 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.209
 is at risk is so talented in 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.360
 one week attention 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.430
 There are horses , you need them too 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.820
 joachim pissed but it works if 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.330
 to let time and do not exaggerate 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.510
 blame 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.300
 you can see the horse is intact in the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.530
 application remains in the shoulder 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.530
 children today and remains intact
