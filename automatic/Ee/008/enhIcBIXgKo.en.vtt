00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:12.950
 whenever I'm because with the moto bridge 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 ex is the first motorola smartphone 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.550
 designed launched after the company 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.070
 was purchased by google with a drawing 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.650
 specifications and specifications appropriate to your 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.240
 proposal it pleases everyone from geeks 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 ordinary people who do not even know that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.359
 processor is inside the flex motor 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.700
 it leaves factory with android 4.2 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 slightly modified garden 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.559
 the national version of the motor action 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.570
 received the update for android 4.4 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.070
 one of the great merits of this apparatus is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.200
 low motorola interference in the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 android the system is very close to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.079
 pure google experience that counts 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.450
 points 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.489
 beyond the usability beauty superior to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.949
 bases of other manufacturers 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.960
 performance also improves among 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.000
 small stirs motorola some 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.050
 such as, for example, 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.489
 watch 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.230
 it is an ep that changes the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.309
 behavior of the smartphone according to 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.989
 with contexts 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.460
 when the user is driving in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.900
 meetings or sleeping 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.400
 some settings are changed 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.400
 automatically to help you 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.240
 Another very cool one is my favorite 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.369
 active notifications instead of a led 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.280
 the ex engine illuminates a few pixels of your 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.229
 screen to display the clock and 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.420
 new notifications whenever you pick up 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.909
 it with a touch more details as 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 notifications are displayed and dragging the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.320
 up the unlocked smartphone 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.360
 Direct is not corresponding to a resource 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.890
 simple but works amazingly 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 well and it's a bit useful 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.369
 google is not called by voice even with 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.920
 motor locked rest flex works 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.820
 with any other android version 4.1 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.770
 up 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.570
 now with new commands in Portuguese 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.240
 it became even more interesting 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 if you want to see a video dedicated to 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 google in flex engine click on thumbnail 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.479
 what is showing 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.680
 another cool trick of the flex engine is a 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.900
 movement to open the camera 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.880
 quickly even with it locked 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.920
 rotate twice as if the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 device was a doorknob and the camera 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.530
 open the camera called the pixel has 10 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.510
 megapixels and comes with promises of good 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.510
 performance in low light thanks to 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.800
 presence of a rgbc filter and pixels 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.720
 larger than normal 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.590
 in practice, it is 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.209
 condition 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.340
 even though it is generally a camera 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.980
 able to deliver 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 very beautiful results 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.450
 motorola has modified ep from the camera 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 simplifying to the extreme the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.959
 absence of resources is compensated by 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.540
 a direct and more pleasant interface 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.610
 all wagner android standard coffee is the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.110
 trigger means just tap 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.280
 any part of the screen so that the photo 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.140
 be taken 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.680
 see some videos and photos made with 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.680
 motorcycle ex 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.220
 the screen is not full hd but postponing 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.380
 definition and supersaturated's Who 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.269
 prefer yes and this technology that 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.940
 enables the active notifications that I 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.680
 I also liked the color speed 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.700
 like red orange and it bothers me one 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.799
 little 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.470
 although it has a screen of 4.7 inches 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.239
 in the flex motor it is very compact it is 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.269
 fits very well in the hand and is easy to 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.160
 to handle 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.260
 ignore the cross specifications if 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.209
 flex motor paper seems weaker than 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.360
 other high-end smartphones 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.950
 in practice it is a quick and smart treat 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.170
 full of useful resources 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.180
 it's a fantastic company its price 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.130
 suggested is 1,500 reais but it is not 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.290
 hard to find at retail for good 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.470
 less than about one thousand reais 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.660
 she got the benefits hard to beat 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.660
 and most importantly without compromising
