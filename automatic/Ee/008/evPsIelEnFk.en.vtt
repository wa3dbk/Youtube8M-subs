00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
as you can see I didn't fully assemble

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.610 
as you can see I didn't fully assemble
the<00:00:51.300> model<00:00:51.480> ahead<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> time<00:00:52.079> I've<00:00:52.379> got<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the model ahead of time I've got a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
the model ahead of time I've got a
couple<00:00:53.039> sub<00:00:53.309> assemblies<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.750> just

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
couple sub assemblies here and that just

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.119 
couple sub assemblies here and that just
makes<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> little<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.559> easier<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.860> paint

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
makes it a little bit easier to paint

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
makes it a little bit easier to paint
and<00:00:56.399> I'll<00:00:56.489> glue<00:00:56.789> those<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> end

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
so that the the newland oil would bring

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.900 
so that the the newland oil would bring
them<00:03:24.540> down<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> touch<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:26.370> kind<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.610> blend

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
them down a touch and just kind of blend

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.210 
them down a touch and just kind of blend
things<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.330> bit<00:03:27.510> these<00:03:28.470> little<00:03:28.770> Wester

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.240 
things in a bit these little Wester
jewel<00:03:29.430> arms<00:03:30.440> or<00:03:31.440> whatever<00:03:31.560> they're<00:03:31.860> called

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
they I left those on the sprue just

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.290 
they I left those on the sprue just
because<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.670> way<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.000> their<00:03:36.120> position

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
because the way that their position

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.410 
because the way that their position
there<00:03:36.690> made<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.080> pretty<00:03:37.200> easy<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.650> do<00:03:37.800> that

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.750 
some of the edge highlighting on the
silver<00:03:58.350> bits<00:03:58.530> trying<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.130> bring<00:03:59.310> out<00:03:59.459> any<00:03:59.610> of

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
silver bits trying to bring out any of

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.140 
silver bits trying to bring out any of
those<00:03:59.820> colors<00:04:04.220> minimal<00:04:05.220> highlighting<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
those colors minimal highlighting on the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.960 
those colors minimal highlighting on the
silver<00:04:06.480> really<00:04:06.750> just<00:04:07.080> enough<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:08.670> make<00:04:08.850> it

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
silver really just enough to to make it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.630 
silver really just enough to to make it
look<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.240> bit<00:04:09.270> newer<00:04:09.660> than<00:04:09.780> after<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.350> wash

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
look a bit newer than after the wash

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.490 
look a bit newer than after the wash
again<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.790> gold<00:04:12.060> again<00:04:12.570> not<00:04:12.750> too<00:04:12.930> much<00:04:13.080> gold<00:04:13.320> on

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
again is gold again not too much gold on

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.430 
again is gold again not too much gold on
here<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:13.920> little<00:04:14.340> bits<00:04:14.520> here<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.790> there<00:04:15.440> again

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
here so little bits here and there again

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.140 
here so little bits here and there again
to<00:04:16.560> brighten<00:04:16.890> up<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.010> gold<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.700> make<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.090> a

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
to brighten up the gold and make it a

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.909 
to brighten up the gold and make it a
bit<00:04:18.299> more<00:04:18.890> shiny

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.100 

okay<00:04:24.919> now<00:04:25.160> Tec<00:04:25.520> less<00:04:25.729> blue<00:04:26.030> highlighting<00:04:26.990> up

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
okay now Tec less blue highlighting up

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.490 
okay now Tec less blue highlighting up
some<00:04:27.919> of<00:04:28.039> those<00:04:28.160> hoses<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:29.349> bottles<00:04:30.349> of

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
some of those hoses and bottles of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.860 
some of those hoses and bottles of
things<00:04:30.740> here<00:04:31.069> and<00:04:31.190> there<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:32.360> with<00:04:32.509> this<00:04:32.629> one

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
things here and there so with this one

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.439 
things here and there so with this one
I'm<00:04:33.620> trying<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.009> draw<00:04:34.340> kind<00:04:34.789> of<00:04:34.879> the<00:04:35.060> line

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
I'm trying to draw kind of the line

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.080 
I'm trying to draw kind of the line
where<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.220> liquids<00:04:37.220> are<00:04:37.340> sitting<00:04:37.699> there<00:04:37.879> and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
where the liquids are sitting there and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.719 
where the liquids are sitting there and
so<00:04:38.720> trying<00:04:39.349> to<00:04:39.409> do<00:04:39.590> basically<00:04:40.340> where<00:04:40.550> they

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
so trying to do basically where they

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.510 
so trying to do basically where they
would<00:04:40.879> be<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:41.330> gravity<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.830> some<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.310> them<00:04:43.400> are

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
would be but gravity so some of them are

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.460 
would be but gravity so some of them are
on<00:04:43.669> angles<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:44.389> whatnot<00:04:46.270> obviously<00:04:47.470> things

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
on angles and whatnot obviously things

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.350 
on angles and whatnot obviously things
are<00:04:48.620> moving<00:04:48.919> around<00:04:49.009> on<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.520> battlefield<00:04:50.090> so

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
are moving around on the battlefield so

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.460 
are moving around on the battlefield so
I'm<00:04:50.419> not<00:04:50.569> too<00:04:50.750> worried<00:04:51.050> about<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.229> being

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
I'm not too worried about it being

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.140 
I'm not too worried about it being
exactly<00:04:52.190> level<00:04:52.430> with<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.629> way<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:53.870> sits

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
exactly level with the way it sits

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.360 
exactly level with the way it sits
okay<00:04:56.150> now<00:04:56.389> basically<00:04:57.229> finishing<00:04:57.919> off<00:04:58.069> with

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
okay now basically finishing off with

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.480 
okay now basically finishing off with
white<00:04:58.580> scar<00:04:58.909> highlights<00:04:59.389> on<00:04:59.630> those<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:01.250> flesh

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
white scar highlights on those the flesh

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.899 
white scar highlights on those the flesh
bits<00:05:01.759> and<00:05:02.199> as<00:05:03.199> well<00:05:03.500> on<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.009> edge<00:05:04.159> lines<00:05:04.639> of

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
bits and as well on the edge lines of

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.760 
bits and as well on the edge lines of
the<00:05:04.970> bottles<00:05:05.330> just<00:05:05.509> to<00:05:05.599> give<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.349> final

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
the bottles just to give the the final

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.620 
the bottles just to give the the final
sort<00:05:07.039> of<00:05:07.159> variation<00:05:08.120> there<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:09.500> here<00:05:10.340> we<00:05:10.460> are

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630
