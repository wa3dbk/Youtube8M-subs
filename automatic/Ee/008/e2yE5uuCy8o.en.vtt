00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.349
 hello dear friends of youtube well 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.819
 minutes because I'm ashton and for this 

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:08.650
 video I'll show you the continuation 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.269
 of the lids of miranda threads that 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.259
 You already saw those that I already showed you 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.759
 they left in the year 99 2000 or so 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 between that time now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.310
 those that leave between the year 2000 or 2001 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.670
 You will see they are very different from those that already 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.320
 saw I'll start with border free 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.100
 see what is different about it is that 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.780
 these move are three dimensional there 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.320
 We have a border flowing attack from 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:38.440
 spores these came out in manzanita sun and 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.469
 some in miranda I think see there we have 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.659
 to wisin throwing mud attack or as 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.620
 i would say james head yandel attack if ya 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.079
 you know how I change 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.950
 the names of the attacks by the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.600
 Latin dubbing 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.750

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.829
 that I lost interest in the promotion and 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.190

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.909

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.600
 of hasbro when they were distributed glue 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.140

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.510
 these packages was where the figure was coming from 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.610
 from the baby to the figure came this manual 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.310
 there are the pokemon for you to go 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.760
 checking if you already have it or not 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.140
 if you have it repeated no more than nothing 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.140
 based on 250 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:45.260
 as I said covers about 150 I think 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.189
 I think I 'm sure 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.989
 see and magna main box elder let's go 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.069
 take a quick look at it because everyone already 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.739
 you know this pokemon 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.560
 you do not have to show them one 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.540
 one 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.790
 like on the internet there are many lists 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.250
 of them good 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.680

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.439
 to your favorite pokemon and build your 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.959
 collection as big as you decide and 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.480
 It is what I decided to do in my 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.430
 collection as big as I decided to see 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.449
 these pokemon watches came out but 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.130
 I never had one too, there were no stuffed animals 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.380
 action figures this watch would like 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.320
 find it but no matter how hard I look for it 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.240
 I find these are like the balance 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.110
 that I showed you before it was handled with 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.750
