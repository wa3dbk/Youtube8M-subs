00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
music to sound crisp clear and without

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.069 
music to sound crisp clear and without
interference<00:02:09.700> that's<00:02:09.940> really<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.780> for

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
interference that's really it and for

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.470 
interference that's really it and for

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
that the beats are great I was using a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.539 
that the beats are great I was using a
pair<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.810> bose<00:02:14.320> soundtrue<00:02:14.890> headphones<00:02:15.070> which

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
pair of bose soundtrue headphones which

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.310 
pair of bose soundtrue headphones which
are<00:02:15.640> way<00:02:16.030> more<00:02:16.299> comfortable<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:17.200> when

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
are way more comfortable but when

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.960

comparing the audio to the beats the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.000 
comparing the audio to the beats the
beats<00:02:19.269> blow<00:02:20.019> them<00:02:20.290> away<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.590> always<00:02:20.739> thought

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
beats blow them away I always thought

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.740
