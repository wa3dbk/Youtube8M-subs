00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.459
 and so guys today's exercise 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.500
 aimed at the leg muscles this lunges but with 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.260
 certain position requirements 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.989
 back and to the position of the hands we throw our hands 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.720
 and practically reduce their castle let's 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.569
 demonstrate that is one brush 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.400
 Sew 2 brush behind my back, I would force 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.220
 back to maintain the correct position and 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.660
 so if the right foot is forward then the left 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.239
 elbow up we spread our legs 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.239
 wide enough and lunge 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.210
 touched the knee of the earth rose up 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.690
 once again 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:52.240
 touched the knee of the earth rose up 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.600
 thanks to the position of my hands of course 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.640
 due to 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.930
 because of the muscle mass is hard to reduce 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.230
 behind the hands but actually i have 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.270
 don't even come down but it doesn't stop doing 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.500
 exercise 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.690
 qualitatively in terms of load on 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:15.150
 legs and so knee touched became knee 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:19.980
 touched stood knee touched rose 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.980
 again and berg 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.220
 So in this exercise, your task 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.960
 make the maximum amount 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.510
 consecutive times with perfect 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.300
 technique what is the ideal technique 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.240
 this is the correct position of the feet touching 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.490
 knee at the bottom point of emphasis on the heel 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.580
 front foot and stubborn toe rear 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.080
 foot without changing the position of the legs you do 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.610
 sequentially without stopping the recording 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.560
 maximum number of times and send 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.510
