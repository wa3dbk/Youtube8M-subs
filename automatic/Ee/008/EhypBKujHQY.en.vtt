main<00:00:48.219> motherboard<00:00:48.610> we<00:00:49.149> want<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.360> think<00:00:49.420> about

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
main motherboard we want to think about

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.450 
main motherboard we want to think about
it<00:00:49.719> like<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.870> controls<00:00:50.620> everything<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.309> can

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
it like that controls everything you can

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.069 
it like that controls everything you can
always<00:00:51.670> get<00:00:51.879> your<00:00:52.030> battery<00:00:52.420> performance<00:00:52.600> that

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
always get your battery performance that

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.139 
always get your battery performance that
you<00:00:53.140> see<00:00:53.289> we<00:00:53.409> got<00:00:53.500> 61<00:00:53.980> miles<00:00:54.129> left<00:00:54.820> when<00:00:55.030> we've

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
you see we got 61 miles left when we've

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.110 
you see we got 61 miles left when we've
been<00:00:55.269> driving<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.629> car<00:00:55.839> all<00:00:56.019> day<00:00:56.230> know<00:00:57.120> you've

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
been driving the car all day know you've

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.729 
been driving the car all day know you've
got<00:00:58.329> all<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.600> different<00:00:58.719> screens<00:00:58.930> here<00:00:59.530> so

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
got all the different screens here so

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.139 
got all the different screens here so
this<00:00:59.890> shows<00:01:00.219> how<00:01:00.579> you've<00:01:00.729> actually<00:01:00.879> been

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
this shows how you've actually been

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.509 
this shows how you've actually been
driving<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.659> car<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:02.110> got<00:01:02.350> 15<00:01:02.799> miles<00:01:03.040> 30

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
driving the car you got 15 miles 30

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.080 
driving the car you got 15 miles 30
miles<00:01:04.740> five<00:01:05.740> miles<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.310> kind<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.880> tracked

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
miles five miles so you kind of tracked

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.270 
miles five miles so you kind of tracked
it<00:01:07.180> from<00:01:07.330> there<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.590> shows<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.860> amount<00:01:09.159> of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
it from there this shows the amount of

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.240 
it from there this shows the amount of
G's<00:01:09.520> you're<00:01:09.759> pulling<00:01:10.149> on<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.360> car<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.770> from

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
G's you're pulling on the car then from

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.700 
G's you're pulling on the car then from
over<00:01:12.490> here<00:01:12.810> you've<00:01:13.810> got<00:01:13.990> your<00:01:14.020> tachometers

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
over here you've got your tachometers

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.469 
over here you've got your tachometers
you<00:01:14.920> can<00:01:15.039> see<00:01:15.190> it's<00:01:15.310> one-to-one<00:01:15.789> ratio<00:01:15.970> so

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
you can see it's one-to-one ratio so

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.230 
you can see it's one-to-one ratio so
14,000<00:01:17.409> RPM<00:01:17.560> most<00:01:18.100> cars<00:01:18.340> redline<00:01:18.789> at<00:01:18.970> 8<00:01:19.179> or

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
14,000 RPM most cars redline at 8 or

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.840 
14,000 RPM most cars redline at 8 or
9,000<00:01:20.050> well<00:01:20.679> with<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:20.830> single<00:01:21.250> Garin<00:01:21.520> lectric

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
9,000 well with a single Garin lectric

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.980 
9,000 well with a single Garin lectric
motor<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.210> are<00:01:22.270> able<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.479> get<00:01:22.659> much<00:01:22.810> higher

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
motor you are able to get much higher

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.309 
motor you are able to get much higher
top<00:01:23.979> speeds<00:01:24.280> 125<00:01:24.970> this<00:01:25.539> is<00:01:25.690> your<00:01:25.840> kilowatts

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
top speeds 125 this is your kilowatts

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.350 
top speeds 125 this is your kilowatts
right<00:01:26.560> here<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:26.920> when<00:01:27.039> you<00:01:27.069> accelerate<00:01:27.429> you'll

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
right here so when you accelerate you'll

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.260 
right here so when you accelerate you'll
actually<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:29.740> expending<00:01:30.550> energy<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:31.090> then

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
actually be expending energy and then

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.669 
actually be expending energy and then
when<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:31.539> let<00:01:31.780> off<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.050> accelerator<00:01:32.289> and

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
when you let off the accelerator and

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.740 
when you let off the accelerator and
getting<00:01:33.369> that<00:01:33.490> energy<00:01:33.909> and<00:01:34.300> putting<00:01:34.539> it<00:01:34.659> back

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
getting that energy and putting it back

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.180 
getting that energy and putting it back
into<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.080> batteries<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:36.039> that's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
into the batteries and that's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.240 
into the batteries and that's
regenerative<00:01:36.789> braking<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:38.710> you've<00:01:38.890> got<00:01:39.069> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
regenerative braking then you've got the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.370 
regenerative braking then you've got the
entire<00:01:39.490> touchscreen<00:01:40.179> over<00:01:41.020> here<00:01:41.200> with

and just don't like clean look
yeah<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.209> really<00:02:26.480> nice<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.110> much<00:02:27.260> liquor

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.920 

so<00:02:53.370> was<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.790> when<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.570> flipped<00:02:54.810> your

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
so was the when you just flipped your

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.750 
so was the when you just flipped your
foot<00:02:55.110> off<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.260> gas<00:02:55.530> was<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.040> close<00:02:56.430> that's

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
foot off the gas was that close that's

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.060 
foot off the gas was that close that's
what<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.390> 3<00:02:57.660> gentle<00:02:57.930> tinking<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:58.950> not

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
what that's 3 gentle tinking so I'm not

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.770 
what that's 3 gentle tinking so I'm not
gonna<00:02:59.250> break<00:02:59.460> in<00:02:59.670> there<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.180> car<00:03:00.510> slowing

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
gonna break in there the car slowing

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.240 
gonna break in there the car slowing
itself<00:03:01.170> down<00:03:01.320> then<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.680> capturing<00:03:02.130> that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
itself down then it's capturing that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.790 
itself down then it's capturing that
energy<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.120> driven<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.660> back<00:03:03.780> into<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> that's

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
energy and driven it back into it that's
