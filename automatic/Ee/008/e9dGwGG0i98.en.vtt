was on Mother's weaknesses so yeah I
mean<00:02:02.480> I<00:02:02.750> don't<00:02:03.170> think<00:02:03.350> God<00:02:03.530> will<00:02:03.710> defeat

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.330 
mean I don't think God will defeat
madara<00:02:04.790> perhaps<00:02:05.450> but<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.290> think<00:02:07.040> that<00:02:07.220> he

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
madara perhaps but like I think that he

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.190 
madara perhaps but like I think that he
will<00:02:07.580> give<00:02:07.970> like<00:02:08.210> stealing<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.810> lot<00:02:08.960> of<00:02:09.020> damage

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
will give like stealing a lot of damage

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.430 
will give like stealing a lot of damage
but<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.610> point<00:02:10.820> where<00:02:11.060> he's<00:02:11.240> like<00:02:11.390> dad<00:02:11.720> on

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
but to the point where he's like dad on

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.110 
but to the point where he's like dad on
the<00:02:12.560> brink<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.920> death<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.370> don't<00:02:13.580> think<00:02:13.700> that

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
the brink of death I don't think that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.910 
the brink of death I don't think that
and<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.990> reason<00:02:15.140> why<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.410> say<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.860> because

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
and the reason why I say that is because

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.720
