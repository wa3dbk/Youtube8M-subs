I<00:00:33.460> was<00:00:33.550> wondering<00:00:33.940> about<00:00:34.030> I've<00:00:34.750> been<00:00:34.930> followed

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
I was wondering about I've been followed

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.869 
I was wondering about I've been followed
following<00:00:35.680> you<00:00:35.769> for<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:35.980> few<00:00:36.190> years<00:00:36.430> months<00:00:36.670> now

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
following you for a few years months now

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.130 
following you for a few years months now
for<00:00:36.909> motivation<00:00:37.510> I<00:00:37.570> notice<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.809> few<00:00:37.900> things

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
for motivation I notice a few things

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.540 
for motivation I notice a few things
you're<00:00:38.260> a<00:00:38.320> very<00:00:38.559> bit<00:00:38.710> on<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.829> liquid<00:00:39.070> food<00:00:39.370> so<00:00:39.489> I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
you're a very bit on a liquid food so I

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.069 
you're a very bit on a liquid food so I
just<00:00:39.699> think<00:00:39.820> is<00:00:39.909> easier<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.269> get<00:00:40.449> in<00:00:40.750> get<00:00:41.019> a

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
just think is easier to get in get a

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.960 
just think is easier to get in get a
higher<00:00:41.260> number<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.589> macros<00:00:42.010> down<00:00:42.220> and<00:00:42.489> it's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
higher number of macros down and it's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.000 
higher number of macros down and it's
much<00:00:43.120> easier<00:00:43.449> during<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.750> bulk<00:00:43.989> also<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.769> lift

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
much easier during a bulk also you lift

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.410 
much easier during a bulk also you lift
heavier<00:00:45.309> than<00:00:45.460> most<00:00:45.550> bodybuilders<00:00:45.970> are

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
heavier than most bodybuilders are

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.790 
heavier than most bodybuilders are
they're<00:00:46.899> actually<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.290> difference<00:00:47.620> in<00:00:47.739> the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
they're actually a difference in the

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.290 
they're actually a difference in the
results<00:00:48.159> of<00:00:48.250> how<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.430> look<00:00:48.670> reflected<00:00:49.210> on

venture to guess I haven't talked to all
of<00:07:19.220> them<00:07:19.480> however<00:07:20.480> however<00:07:21.260> I<00:07:21.770> do<00:07:22.280> believe

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
of them however however I do believe

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.280 
of them however however I do believe
that<00:07:22.790> level<00:07:23.210> of<00:07:23.300> drug<00:07:23.510> use<00:07:23.720> does<00:07:23.930> play<00:07:24.170> a<00:07:24.200> role

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
that level of drug use does play a role

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.230 
that level of drug use does play a role
and<00:07:24.560> what<00:07:24.710> kind<00:07:24.980> they<00:07:25.160> use<00:07:25.400> and<00:07:25.610> what<00:07:25.640> they<00:07:25.940> eat

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
and what kind they use and what they eat

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.300 
and what kind they use and what they eat
and<00:07:26.300> how<00:07:26.600> they<00:07:26.750> bulk<00:07:27.110> and<00:07:27.320> all<00:07:27.800> that<00:07:27.980> plays<00:07:28.280> a

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
and how they bulk and all that plays a

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.040 
and how they bulk and all that plays a
role<00:07:28.460> so<00:07:29.000> what<00:07:29.480> you<00:07:29.600> need<00:07:29.720> to<00:07:29.780> do<00:07:29.870> is<00:07:29.930> figure
