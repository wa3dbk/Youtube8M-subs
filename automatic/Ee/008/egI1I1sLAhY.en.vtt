00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello very good artur de barcina 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.940
 minecraft we are here with another vice of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.170
 domÃ³tica let's enter our house 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.170
 I know what built 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 that does not work there but that 's why 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.919
 because a disabled lever now now 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.870
 works according to whether you remember in the 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.230
 last chapter we build 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.079
 this here our role was where 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.780
 you can throw things and burn them 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.089
 and I told you very, but now there is a pressure 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 kate on the floor as I have a problem 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.829
 with the symmetry I will have to put water 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.920
 here, I've been thinking and I've put 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.019
 something here and it is also something more beautiful and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.149
 more complex I think there's something there 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.780
 little more advanced of the redstone if you 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.939
 you ask because I have two tics and three 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.949
 hide looks in the inventory I hope 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:08.630
 that we're going to graffiti you a little bit so 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.630
 get ready and go ahead 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.190
 perfect because it has appeared here in 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.100
 our crafting table and we can 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.430
 catch a peak here I have it look what 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.430
 beautiful 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.890
 and it is already crafting see itself completely 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.159
 disguised we will see how built 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.140
 this 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.569
 it's just a block changer 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.920
 activated by a prisoner plate there are other 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.600
 ways of doing it the truth is that there 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.850
 many and we have done many in the channel 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.630
 but in the way that I built it 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.860
 it takes up a lot of space and I had to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.110
 make another floor down here 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.290
 this is basically to test if 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.720
 it worked here we have the input and we're going 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.770
 to do it by parts the colored wool 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.360
 green will symbolize the hiding of the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.330
 writing table while the wool of 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.490
 red color on the wall was golden 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.080
 kraft eo - this is the input here 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.350
 I should have changed color but 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.380
 well do not worry about here arrives 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.770
 the signal from that pressure plate leads to 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.320
 these to these two parts this is racing 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.550
 detector and I'm falling the detector 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.770
 I'll put a mega link here so you can 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.690
 go all to see what they are and 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.880
 how it works but good 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.680
 and explained above this detects 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.930
 when a cable is turned on it is already 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.180
 it detects when a cable goes off follows 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.150
 when we step on it, there will be a signal here 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.430
 and when the xxvi we jump sign by 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.680
 here 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.150
 the next one here is relatively short 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.700
 so this is just an extender 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.840
 go through here a tick goes through here 3 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.019
 ticks we release 2 tics and national ups 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.409
 around here for this column of torches and 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.409
 goes to two sides goes to this column of 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.829
 torches that is will move the piston 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.000
 sticky that holds the block so 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.879
 The first thing you will do is take this 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.560
 piston and throw it to the back once 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.540
 created to back this piston with 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.849
 extendable and from here 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.540
 this other non-sticky piston push to 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.629
 the crafting table and the trunk block 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.129
 or whatever it is called there will be here over 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.129
 both will be created up 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 continuously the signal will stop 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.480
 work so what will happen will be 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.760
 simple 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.410
 I think that this is here so that 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.290
 Now that I look at it, you are fighting this 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.400
 piston here so 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.400
 for the moment 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.580
 we will leave it here 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.160
 and we will put another christ in because this 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.830
 did not take you to the store according to 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.960
 for a moment what will happen is this 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.080
 pulls back the trunk appears 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.750
 here the two raise the piston can lower 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.540
 and this can push pulling in place 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.750
 of the trunk the cardboard table and 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.730
 exactly works the other way around we have 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.740
 here the protective jog that will have 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.750
 when you step on the prisoner plate 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.460
 If you do not forget here, go through here 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.230
 three sticks of difference and between here 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.940
 this saga is a little longer so 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.170
 we allow ourselves the claw 3 ticks without that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.170
 two simultaneous signals remain 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.570
 if I'm going a little faster 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.250
 explain this please tell me in the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:31.850
 comments but I assume you already have a 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.290
 certain as what we will do agility with 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.479
 the rest although you know what I'm 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.889
 talking about the sanchez hector if not the 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.660
 you know, it does not matter, you can see the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.400
 video before you finish watching this for 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.350
 understand it well but when I talk about 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.840
 arsenal when I talk about tics and this 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.220
 I hope you all understand me without any 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.190
 problem leave it to me in the comments 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.600
 and I go a little slower and explain a 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.000
 little more 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.490
 Well, this here is another column 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.830
 of torches that we will now visit 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.080
 we will go up here and this is with one of 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.330
 torches here on one side goes back to 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.670
 activate the central piston or rather 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.670
 deactivate it in this case and on the other 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.250
 side goes through here to do through 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.510
 all these torches and repeaters what 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.840
 same as we did with the piston 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.000
 lower in the upper level here is 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.430
 very simple because it is all straight for 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.920
 repeaters that there is already a pressure to 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:28.070
 three plus one torch 4 123 ticks esteva 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.950
 8 be more 7 does not matter the truth but 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.610
 it comes to be exactly the same so 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.770
 is now the perfect despistada which 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.110
 we stepped on this already back this 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.980
 will go up and this gets out and when 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.590
 we are going to leave this will go down and 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.660
 will push the two that are currently 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.120
 down 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.460
 and that's saying let's go back to 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.300
 check that everything works because I've 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.300
 touched something 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:01.569
 and here we have our racing table and 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:04.289
 we can propose a text to the viewpoint and 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.289
 now it's going to come out 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.910
 we can have normal wall m 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.910
 It's that simple 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.980
 if you notice having stepped on one 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.880
 once nothing happened 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.730
 but how do we assume that 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.930
 you are here and digital character only the 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.000
 users only have that catch them in 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.500
 mind physalis by accident but now 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.090
 You see that you think about it in the West 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.040
 bebeto what happens is that it is not saved 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.590
 because he has no time and died of the 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.570
 pistons twice so if you okay 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.770
 come out now go back to do the 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.810
 exit procedure and now it closes 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.370
 but hey this has been one of the 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.410
 videos of the home automation project and this saga 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.729
 I think we 'll have it finished, I hope 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.530
 that you liked the video and you know 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.449
 if you want to see more of us and 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.449
 subscribe goodbye one low all
