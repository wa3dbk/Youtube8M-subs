bottom and what I want to do today is

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.500 
bottom and what I want to do today is
create<00:00:32.280> bigger<00:00:32.490> stripes<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.060> the<00:00:33.150> bottom<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
create bigger stripes on the bottom that

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
create bigger stripes on the bottom that
gets<00:00:33.690> smaller<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.560> the<00:00:34.710> top<00:00:34.920> lay

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
gets smaller as they go to the top lay

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.640 
gets smaller as they go to the top lay
down<00:00:35.730> my<00:00:35.850> bag<00:00:36.090> make<00:00:36.420> sure<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.690> very<00:00:36.900> flat<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
down my bag make sure it's very flat and

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.460 
down my bag make sure it's very flat and
open<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.520> now<00:00:38.940> using<00:00:39.330> my<00:00:39.450> tape<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
open and now using my tape I'm going to

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.340 
open and now using my tape I'm going to
lay<00:00:40.860> down<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.430> first<00:00:41.730> larger<00:00:42.480> stripe<00:00:42.840> starting

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
lay down my first larger stripe starting

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.240 
lay down my first larger stripe starting
at<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.440> bottom<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.830> think<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.130> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
at the bottom I think this is the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.350 
at the bottom I think this is the
easiest<00:00:44.610> way<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:46.640> thing<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> keep<00:00:47.880> in<00:00:48.000> mind<00:00:48.060> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
easiest way a thing to keep in mind is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.240 
easiest way a thing to keep in mind is
you<00:00:48.420> want<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:48.720> tape<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.080> be<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.590> pressed

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you want the tape to be really pressed

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.920 
you want the tape to be really pressed
down<00:00:50.550> against<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> bag<00:00:51.240> that<00:00:51.540> way<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> don't

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
down against the bag that way you don't

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.960 
down against the bag that way you don't
have<00:00:51.960> any<00:00:52.200> leakage<00:00:52.950> when<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.520> pull<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.790> the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
have any leakage when we pull up the

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.490 
have any leakage when we pull up the
tape<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.360> wanted<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.110> straight

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
tape we wanted to have a really straight

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.820 
tape we wanted to have a really straight
line<00:00:55.740> so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.430> put<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:56.970> stripe<00:00:57.870> down<00:00:58.170> but

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
line so I put my first stripe down but

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.320 
line so I put my first stripe down but
the<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:58.950> is<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.580> create<00:00:59.850> those<00:01:00.000> stripes

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
the thing is is to create those stripes

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.030 
the thing is is to create those stripes
that<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.540> different<00:01:00.990> sizes<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.860> actually

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
that are different sizes I'm actually

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.470 
that are different sizes I'm actually
going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> layer<00:01:02.490> another<00:01:02.880> piece<00:01:03.150> of<00:01:03.360> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
going to layer another piece of this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.109 
going to layer another piece of this
same<00:01:03.720> size<00:01:03.960> tape<00:01:04.259> right<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.949> top<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.729> create<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
same size tape right on top to create a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.370 
same size tape right on top to create a
different<00:01:06.299> size<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.719> then<00:01:07.109> make<00:01:07.289> them

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
different size and then make them

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.190 
different size and then make them
smaller<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.100> smaller<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.579> I<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.140> today<00:01:10.140> I'm

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
smaller and smaller as I go on today I'm

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.660 
smaller and smaller as I go on today I'm
going<00:01:10.259> with<00:01:10.500> black<00:01:10.740> acrylic<00:01:10.890> paint<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.579> you
