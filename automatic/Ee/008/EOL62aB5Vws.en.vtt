streak<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> only<00:01:17.250> other<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
streak I think the only other one that I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.950 
streak I think the only other one that I
get<00:01:18.270> more<00:01:18.509> kills<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> dogs<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
get more kills with is the dogs and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
usually I hold down one area until I hit

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
usually I hold down one area until I hit
each<00:01:24.420> three<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> killstreaks<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> once<00:01:25.920> i

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070

much whenever I go for a kill a lot of
the<00:02:07.770> times<00:02:08.039> I'll<00:02:08.849> clearly<00:02:09.569> stab<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.259> enemy

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the times I'll clearly stab the enemy

even if they're not shooting me and for
some<00:02:12.300> reason

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
some reason

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.210 
some reason
sometimes<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.410> knife<00:02:13.620> goes<00:02:13.920> completely

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220

quit<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.520> necessarily<00:02:41.730> think<00:02:42.300> they

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
quit I don't necessarily think they

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.059 
quit I don't necessarily think they
deserve<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:43.020> punished<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.709> but<00:02:44.040> I

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
deserve to be punished for it but I

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.220 
deserve to be punished for it but I
guess<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.610> could<00:02:44.820> be<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:45.000> good<00:02:45.239> idea<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.720> long<00:02:45.810> as

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
guess it could be a good idea as long as

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.070 
guess it could be a good idea as long as
they<00:02:46.380> fixed<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.640> there<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.390> many<00:02:48.660> flaws

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
they fixed it but there is so many flaws

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.570 
they fixed it but there is so many flaws
