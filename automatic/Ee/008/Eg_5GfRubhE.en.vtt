00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.670
 here we are new video 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.690
 then I have already prepared 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.660
 base and make the flowers the roses 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.360
 those that I see lately 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.480
 I had already made this video unfortunately 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.800
 I don't know what happened but they see themselves 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.130
 all his cati 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:35.230
 and then it's time to do it again 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:38.530
 so I did so let's see if there 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 is not want to go this I did 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:48.550
 this base stop gialle li na li la 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:59.850
 but let's hurt ours for a moment 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 critic will stay well without problems 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.010
 this guy along the roads 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:26.500
 let's go to where we are then I chose 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.020
 here we are, I recommend the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.509
 glass tablet me and a lot that the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.060
 I'm using it and it's more convenient than that 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.880
 the palettes those of plastic that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.579
 always remain stained with color a 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.829
 tables the glass tile 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.719
 so I chose these two colors 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.609
 this for the flowers and this for the 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.119
 leaves 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:52.420
 you can also choose other colors 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.700
 what is important what is important 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:08.729
 both a clear one is a dark one so 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:08.729
 make some contrast ok 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:29.230
 in the meantime, let's make it stand aside 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:38.200
 very simple flower base we do 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:41.050
 so not until they change do we at 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.110
 dark base below because otherwise col 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.110
 yellow would not be seen then 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.319
 then they must do it 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.370
 at least I do a little bigger like that 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:10.230
 we can see when you do them though 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:15.870
 that should be arranged so that I do 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:22.549
 see now just how to do it then 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:25.379
 you will put on it make circles 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:39.409
 even the regulars don't need that 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:39.409
 are perfectly still are 1 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:56.430
 let me dry the bears 30 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:01.260
 seconds and then with the lightest color 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.650
 let's do what is a real e 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.790
 just right drawings which is a rose 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.850
 stylized if you don't know how to do it there 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.270
 one of my previous videos where I explain how 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.270
 you do 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.190
 and within these circles that 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.360
 we did it 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:37.570
 we must go and arrange ours 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.710
 rosina of colors and things the variants 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.710
 what you can really do 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.710
 many 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.620
 also a very easy decoration 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.639
 and quick to do but that is a lot 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.710
 of effect because it is not the historical rose a 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.710
 this base that gives a bit of depth 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.289
 the leaves are very simple 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:38.970
 we do with black tic and white good 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.470
 this is for those who want to know these 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:52.449
 This is a skilled white are 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:56.580
 critics with black 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.580
 let's go and make the leaflets 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.429
 they are just simple, simple to do 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.720
 make a recipe 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.169
 these decorations are very popular 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:51.740
 and fulvio lines now in theory 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:54.129
 they would have to be dried a little though 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.419
 we now turn them on directly 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:01.849
 otherwise with white 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:15.849
 let's go inside the madness 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:19.330
 that we make the dash give a little 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.330
 of light 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.250
 here we are 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:38.340
 wait a moment liked 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:41.090
 then once dried applied the 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:47.690
 shiny were it so you see a little better 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:50.790
 so let's go to the lamp to catalyze 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:59.280
 once done catalyze well it is 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:08:03.620
 cooled we sell degrease and this 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.620
 is the result of our theses 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.000
 I hope this was helpful 

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.270
 video and to the next 

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.270
 Hello
