00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.680
 good i am give these blocked 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.510
 first of all thanks to those who have 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:21.410
 gifted the two packs this week the 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.939
 of the classic shooters games I have 10 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.310
 xinhua years released warriors i made 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.230
 a game and recorded it and that of the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.730
 normal games thanks for the gift of 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.480
 it has really surprised me 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.780
 very curious video and you remember the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.070
 block of solid remains that they added in 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.000
 the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.950
 version prior to 1.6 was 1.5 1.6 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.480
 I think 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.270
 the white of the rest of a 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.150
 particularity that by putting yourself in a 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.280
 active position the surrounding blocks 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.310
 Well, what about if we combine it with the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.440
 yesterday to remove and put blocks we are going to 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.650
 put to command what is fair 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.780
 under an order for in the position in 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.370
 the one that is the reston block that the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.740
 remove the replace by air 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.890
 so yes now to like the blog of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.010
 down we give you signal will happen that goes 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.010
 to disappear solid reston block 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.970
 what good is this good for? 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.890
 more than anything a 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.130
 what would happen if in the coma the block of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.920
 up we do the opposite operation is 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.799
 say that when you receive the rest a 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.509
 block below I put a block of 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.509
 rest even if 152 is given 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.580
 good question no 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.580
 go 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.940
 curiously if you leave the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.920
 lever eat the blog above 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.480
 would stop working or would stop 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.480
 can put a block of rest 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.030
 the same would happen with work if you leave 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.800
 a lever left tight would stop 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.080
 be able to remove it the rest block 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.250
 what good is this good for what is 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.990
 if we do something like this weird 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.690
 You see all that comes out 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.819
 side you see how fast disappears in the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.709
 message when I write in the chat 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.109
 you can stop them by leaving tight 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.519
 either of the two levers more than 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.650
 nothing because you would not let it go back to 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.210
 activate because you would have signal this is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.150
 a very special rest watch 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.090
 is acting like a crazy whore you 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.310
 detector at the same time that is giving 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.840
 energy to the block from top to bottom or 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.250
 we are, there has been an operation of 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.230
 remove the block at the same time what 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.910
 we are putting with what remains 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.760
 marked that the blocks touching that 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.350
 reston block have energy and to the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.840
 same time they are given a block date 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.560
 because of that part of the block 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.360
 getting it to reappear and 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.540
 disappear again a tick of the rest 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.280
 later agreed taking into account 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.319
 that watches 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.300
 to activate they have to turn on and 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.220
 turn off the clock faster than the rest 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.290
 what we can do so far had a 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.420
 time of one tick to turn on and another 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.000
 to turn off this is going on and 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.550
 turning off once per tick so 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.030
 effectively this is a medium clock 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.020
 duration tick 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.970
 and basically, you can not do a 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.310
 clock faster than this 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.830
 is going to shoot as many times as times 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.200
 process the rest of the circuits in the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.940
 logic of the game if tomorrow they will change it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.920
 to give me look 10 times through 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.400
 second they will look at it a hundred times 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.340
 second 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.830
 this clock would continue to jump a hundred times 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.110
 per second can not go faster than 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.320
 agreement for what this good can serve 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.320
 well 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.099
 how would you say 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.150
 You know what happens when you do pp 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.450
 a player to a particular position the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.629
 map so fast that it really can not 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.969
 does not give the game time to let him 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.299
 move or fall or look for 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.299
 other side 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.570
 basically 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.400
 totally blocked can not even 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.850
 even look elsewhere 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.450
 this could be used on a server 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.510
 as a kind of jail for to 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.300
 cheats good considering that 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.960
 they can 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.610
 wisin leave the team pulling that 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.949
 command then 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.750
 It would be better to do a search of the 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.159
 possible players in particular and 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.560
 look in the center of a jail 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.939
 then until you have the 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.430
 lever then in those who were and 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.729
 inside would be blocked in the end like 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.710
 favorites subscribe we have twitter if 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.449
 You did not like me because you told us 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.449
 we see in the next video see you later
