00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.400 
so I'm playing a game in derail and

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.590 
so I'm playing a game in derail and
there's<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.430> lot<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.580> campus<00:00:06.029> in<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.240> building

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
there's a lot of campus in that building

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.299 
there's a lot of campus in that building
there<00:00:07.670> so<00:00:09.080> we'll<00:00:10.080> just<00:00:10.110> go<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.500> see<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:11.099> bad

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
there so we'll just go and see how bad

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.660 
there so we'll just go and see how bad
it<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.700> first<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.299> go<00:00:15.420> out<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> building

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
it is first so we go out to the building

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.090 
it is first so we go out to the building
there's<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.789> least<00:00:17.820> two<00:00:18.240> people<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.779> there

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
there's at least two people in there

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.800 
there's at least two people in there
probably<00:00:20.100> more<00:00:20.279> considering<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> man<00:00:21.539> over

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
probably more considering the man over

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.009 
probably more considering the man over
people<00:00:22.500> there<00:00:22.619> dying<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.300> shows<00:00:24.539> there

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
people there dying so that shows there

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
people there dying so that shows there
at<00:00:25.260> least<00:00:25.470> three<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> stop

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
at least three now this we got to stop

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.080 
at least three now this we got to stop
and<00:00:27.480> think<00:00:27.689> examine<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> situation<00:00:28.939> don't<00:00:29.939> be

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and think examine the situation don't be

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.640 
and think examine the situation don't be
so<00:00:30.300> robotic<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:30.929> everyone<00:00:31.320> else<00:00:31.470> because

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
so robotic like everyone else because

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.100 
so robotic like everyone else because
that's<00:00:31.920> how<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.399> killed<00:00:32.840> there's<00:00:33.840> brute

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that's how you get killed there's brute

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.709 
that's how you get killed there's brute
a<00:00:34.290> witch<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:35.940> shot<00:00:36.239> all

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
a witch we all go in and get shot all

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.990 
a witch we all go in and get shot all
these<00:00:36.870> root<00:00:37.170> B<00:00:37.440> which<00:00:37.770> allows<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.760> get

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
these root B which allows you to get

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.500 
these root B which allows you to get
behind<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:40.079> enemy<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.590> attack<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:42.059> their

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
behind the enemy and attack them their

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600 
behind the enemy and attack them their
camps<00:00:42.930> from<00:00:42.989> behind<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.890> they<00:00:43.980> least<00:00:44.219> expect

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
camps from behind but they least expect

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.510 
camps from behind but they least expect
it<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.329> course<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.809> take<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> just

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it so of course you take be so just

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
it so of course you take be so just
checking<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> there's<00:00:51.390> loads<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.809> loads

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
checking out a there's loads and loads

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.229 
checking out a there's loads and loads
of<00:00:52.140> tracer<00:00:52.770> coming<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.430> still<00:00:53.670> so

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of tracer coming out of it still so

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
of tracer coming out of it still so
we're<00:00:54.660> gonna<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> take<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> we're

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
we're gonna have to take be so we're

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.930 
we're gonna have to take be so we're
going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> run<00:00:59.850> around<00:01:01.699> sometimes<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> can

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
going to run around sometimes you can

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.479 
going to run around sometimes you can
get<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> shot<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.359> behind<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:03.930> try<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
get a shot from behind it but try not to

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.710 
get a shot from behind it but try not to
you'll<00:01:05.489> also<00:01:05.670> try<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.119> keep<00:01:06.330> quite<00:01:06.600> you've

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you'll also try and keep quite you've

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
you'll also try and keep quite you've
got<00:01:06.869> tactical<00:01:07.350> advantage<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> don't<00:01:09.030> them

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
got tactical advantage so you don't them

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.580 
got tactical advantage so you don't them
to<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.080> till<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.409> too

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to know that you're there till it's too

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
to know that you're there till it's too
late<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> I've<00:01:11.820> got<00:01:11.970> two<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:14.270> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
late so I've got two of them there and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.580 
late so I've got two of them there and
we're<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> kill<00:01:15.810> another<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.229> coming

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
we're going to kill another one coming

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060 
we're going to kill another one coming
in<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.080> killed<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.950> just

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
in and then you get killed but that just

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
in and then you get killed but that just
goes<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.700> how<00:01:21.390> um<00:01:21.720> how<00:01:23.180> important<00:01:24.180> techniques

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
goes so how um how important techniques

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
goes so how um how important techniques
are<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.110> lot<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> people<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:26.009> use<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> same

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
are a lot of people just use the same

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
are a lot of people just use the same
old<00:01:26.850> thing<00:01:27.060> don't<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:28.200> about<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
old thing don't think about the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.280 
old thing don't think about the
situation<00:01:28.650> at<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.869> course<00:01:30.900> just

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
situation at all this is of course just

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980 
situation at all this is of course just
one<00:01:31.530> example<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.040> can't<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.390> every

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
one example you can't use this in every

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.550 
one example you can't use this in every
way<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.860> does<00:01:35.040> help<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.790> campers

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
way but it does help if you have campers

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.300 
way but it does help if you have campers
think<00:01:37.560> about<00:01:37.770> how<00:01:37.920> they're<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> be

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
think about how they're going to be

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.499 
think about how they're going to be
doing<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> they're<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.030> covering<00:01:39.360> an

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
doing it they're going to be covering an

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.850 
doing it they're going to be covering an
exit<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.259> campers<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:42.049> how<00:01:43.049> would

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
exit that's what campers do so how would

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.210 
exit that's what campers do so how would
you<00:01:44.030> counteract<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.149> how<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.290> come

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you counteract that how would you come

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.859 
you counteract that how would you come
through<00:01:47.399> another<00:01:47.729> entrance<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:48.689> they

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
through another entrance which they

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
through another entrance which they
wouldn't<00:01:49.140> expect<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.920> come<00:01:50.100> through

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
wouldn't expect you to come through

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
wouldn't expect you to come through
because<00:01:51.180> they're<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.259> your

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
because they're going to be your

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.719 
because they're going to be your
concentrate<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.100> one<00:01:53.250> where<00:01:53.430> everyone's

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
concentrate on one where everyone's

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.130 
concentrate on one where everyone's
coming<00:01:53.970> through<00:01:54.240> they're<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> be

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
coming through they're not going to be

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.300 
coming through they're not going to be
thinking<00:01:55.409> about<00:01:55.439> what's<00:01:55.710> behind<00:01:55.860> them

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
thinking about what's behind them

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.429 
thinking about what's behind them
because<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.270> far<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.479> they're<00:01:57.659> concerned<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
because as far as they're concerned it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.539 
because as far as they're concerned it
runs<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.829> front<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> them<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:01.189> when<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> plane

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
runs in front of them so when you plane

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
runs in front of them so when you plane
don't<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.259> everyone<00:02:04.590> else<00:02:04.799> don't

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
don't just go with everyone else don't

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.069 
don't just go with everyone else don't
just<00:02:05.250> charge<00:02:05.579> try<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.930> what

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
just charge try and think about what

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.479 
just charge try and think about what
you're<00:02:07.200> doing<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:08.129> about<00:02:08.310> where

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
you're doing and think about where

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.010 
you're doing and think about where
you're<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> go<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.479> really<00:02:09.660> helps

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
you're going to go that really helps

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.210 
you're going to go that really helps
when<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.259> try<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.879> rid<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.030> campus

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
when you try to get rid of campus
