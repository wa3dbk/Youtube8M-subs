00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.090
 very good meets before like every year and 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.700
 this time almost without making noise 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.289
 arrive the nike air zoom pegasus 31 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.240
 surely with the most accusing design of 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.090
 the last years in search of a 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.130
 faster lighter shoe and 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.589
 leaving that cushion at his side 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.960
 soft that has characterized him for a 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.960
 firmer that provides greater stability 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 with this model he has searched for 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.250
 lighter and more stable shoes for 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 trainings over long distances and the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.629
 change is so important that they have 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.120
 reduced to his drop something untouchable in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.370
 the range vomero and pegasus goes from the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.470
 traditional 13 millimeters to 10 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.540
 millimeters looking for something more than 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.280
 naturalness in the tread and above all 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.309
 with the intention of reducing the weight of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.920
 The sneaker also incorporate a new 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.899
 much more ergonomic upper made with 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.149
 light mesh with coatings without 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.149
 seams and that fits especially well 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.039
 its high foam cushioning 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.979
 quality keeps the unit in the heel 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.200
 zoom air but its firmness has been improved 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.210
 and reactivity thanks to a series of 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.880
 traction fibers that make up 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.469
 small pressurized air chambers that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.720
 are deformed with the impact of 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.729
 landing but quickly recovers its 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.399
 original shape helping in the transition 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:45.039
 of the tread deep flexible grooves 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.740
 and a rocking chair sole in the 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.380
 forefoot to get flexibility and 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.509
 responsiveness the weight of the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.289
 Sneaker is 300 grams for a 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.729
 number 44 European the toe is something 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.830
 higher to facilitate the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.470
 takeoff built from the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.690
 curvature of the tip of the foot 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.480
 These shoes are designed for 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.700
 long runs at slower speeds 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.300
 four minutes to the kilometer and to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.580
 runners between 70 and 80 85 kilos 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.680
 as much with neutral footprint but that 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.010
 seeking some stability over 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.010
 of the kilometers
