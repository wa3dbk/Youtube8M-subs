essentially<00:03:29.459> there's<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.450> whole<00:03:30.540> bunch<00:03:30.690> of

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
essentially there's a whole bunch of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.820 
essentially there's a whole bunch of
them<00:03:30.959> right<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.320> they<00:03:31.440> all<00:03:31.560> different

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
them right so they all different

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.199 
them right so they all different
opinions<00:03:32.310> they<00:03:32.489> all<00:03:32.610> can<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.940> or<00:03:33.090> dislike

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
opinions they all can like or dislike

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.240 
opinions they all can like or dislike
your<00:03:33.510> actions<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.170> every<00:03:34.799> choice<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.220> make

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
your actions so every choice you make

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.650 
your actions so every choice you make
some<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.730> them<00:03:35.820> might<00:03:35.910> like<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.150> someone<00:03:36.540> might

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
some of them might like it someone might

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.180 
some of them might like it someone might
dislike<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.200> but<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.440> might<00:03:37.709> not<00:03:37.799> be<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.010> same

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
dislike it but it might not be the same

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.490 
dislike it but it might not be the same
ones<00:03:38.370> each<00:03:38.549> time<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.090> lots<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.870> permutations

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
ones each time so lots of permutations

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.020 
ones each time so lots of permutations
and<00:03:40.590> combinations<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:41.250> are<00:03:41.340> pretty<00:03:41.580> cool<00:03:41.880> to

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
and combinations that are pretty cool to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.950 
and combinations that are pretty cool to
explore

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.630 

it's<00:03:47.530> interesting<00:03:47.650> talking<00:03:48.160> through<00:03:48.490> that

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
it's interesting talking through that

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.520 
it's interesting talking through that
because<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.210> already<00:03:49.420> identified<00:03:50.110> two<00:03:50.290> major

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
because you already identified two major

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.620 
because you already identified two major
buckets<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.220> story<00:03:51.580> you<00:03:52.090> know<00:03:52.210> there's<00:03:52.420> I

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
buckets of story you know there's I

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.210 
buckets of story you know there's I
think<00:03:52.780> it's<00:03:52.990> another<00:03:53.170> category<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.800> story<00:03:54.100> as

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
think it's another category of story as

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.530 
think it's another category of story as
well<00:03:54.370> as<00:03:54.490> narrative<00:03:54.910> it's<00:03:55.180> driven<00:03:55.420> by

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
well as narrative it's driven by

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.420 
well as narrative it's driven by
gameplay<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.290> maybe<00:03:56.710> consider<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.250> as<00:03:57.400> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
gameplay so maybe consider that as a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.580 
gameplay so maybe consider that as a
superset<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:57.970> all<00:03:58.750> types<00:03:58.960> of<00:03:59.110> story<00:03:59.410> whether

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
superset of all types of story whether

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.260

it's<00:03:59.740> combat<00:04:00.130> drive<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:00.700> exploration

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
it's combat drive and exploration

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.180 
it's combat drive and exploration
progression<00:04:01.750> or<00:04:01.870> story<00:04:02.170> but<00:04:02.410> focusing<00:04:02.980> on<00:04:03.070> the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
story part of it there can be an

age is more of a first-person author of

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.690 
age is more of a first-person author of
experience<00:04:44.170> where<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.770> are<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.220> character

experience where you are that character

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.860 
experience where you are that character
right<00:04:45.910> from<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.150> moment<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.540> origin

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
right from the moment of the origin

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.510 
right from the moment of the origin
story<00:04:47.170> you're<00:04:47.320> invested<00:04:47.800> as<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.920> character<00:04:48.280> you

story you're invested as a character you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.340 
story you're invested as a character you
take<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.880> role<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.810> really<00:04:50.110> feel<00:04:50.320> like

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
take the role on you really feel like

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.860 
take the role on you really feel like
it's<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.770> it's<00:04:51.490> making<00:04:51.670> those<00:04:51.850> choices<00:04:52.060> so<00:04:52.450> we

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
it's you it's making those choices so we

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.420 
it's you it's making those choices so we
focus<00:04:53.200> on<00:04:53.320> responses<00:04:53.950> a<00:04:53.980> non-player

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
focus on responses a non-player

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.980 
focus on responses a non-player
characters<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.510> that's<00:04:55.870> the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
characters to you and that's the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.390 
characters to you and that's the
difference<00:04:56.140> in<00:04:56.500> our<00:04:56.590> mind<00:04:56.860> between<00:04:57.220> a

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
difference in our mind between a

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.950 
difference in our mind between a
first-person<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.120> third-person<00:04:58.180> authored

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
first-person and third-person authored

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.750 
first-person and third-person authored
experience<00:04:59.470> but<00:04:59.710> there's<00:05:00.160> lots<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.520> ways<00:05:00.580> to

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
experience but there's lots of ways to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.890 
experience but there's lots of ways to
tell<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:00.940> good<00:05:01.120> story<00:05:01.180> and<00:05:01.510> I<00:05:01.600> think<00:05:01.780> they're

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
tell a good story and I think they're

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.600 
tell a good story and I think they're
all<00:05:02.020> really<00:05:02.170> cool<00:05:02.410> what<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.280> meant<00:05:03.490> by

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
all really cool what I meant by

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.100 
all really cool what I meant by
first-person<00:05:04.240> narrative<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.660> is<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:04.960> more

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
first-person narrative it is it's more

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.260 
first-person narrative it is it's more
of<00:05:05.200> an<00:05:05.320> eye<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.830> am<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.280> character<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:07.030> you're

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
of an eye I am that character and you're

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.760 
of an eye I am that character and you're
actually<00:05:07.480> you're<00:05:07.960> unfolding<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.710> know

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
actually you're unfolding you know

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.290 
actually you're unfolding you know
making<00:05:09.010> choices<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:09.550> real<00:05:09.670> time<00:05:09.850> as<00:05:10.060> the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
making choices in real time as the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.970 
making choices in real time as the
character<00:05:10.570> in<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.900> world<00:05:11.110> where's<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.800> third

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
character in the world where's the third

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.950 
character in the world where's the third
person<00:05:12.370> you<00:05:12.730> know<00:05:12.820> it's<00:05:12.970> more<00:05:13.210> you're

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
person you know it's more you're

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.110 
person you know it's more you're
observing<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.560> character<00:05:14.950> you're<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:15.610> you<00:05:15.970> are

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
observing a character you're you you are

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.700 
observing a character you're you you are
that<00:05:16.300> character<00:05:16.660> so<00:05:16.930> it's<00:05:17.050> a<00:05:17.110> second<00:05:17.590> person

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
that character so it's a second person

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.680 
that character so it's a second person
maybe<00:05:18.010> in<00:05:18.220> that<00:05:18.310> sense<00:05:18.580> but<00:05:18.790> it's<00:05:18.970> but<00:05:19.150> but

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
maybe in that sense but it's but but

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.420 
maybe in that sense but it's but but
you're<00:05:19.780> also<00:05:19.930> watching<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.830> character<00:05:21.220> and

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
you're also watching the character and

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.800 
you're also watching the character and
you're<00:05:21.760> seeing<00:05:22.030> what<00:05:22.210> happens<00:05:22.330> when<00:05:22.720> you

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
you're seeing what happens when you

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.050 
you're seeing what happens when you
issue<00:05:23.050> orders<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.800> that<00:05:23.950> character<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.580> sort

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
issue orders to that character and sort

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.670 
issue orders to that character and sort
of<00:05:25.150> not<00:05:25.420> totally<00:05:25.780> clear<00:05:25.990> every<00:05:26.260> time<00:05:26.440> what<00:05:26.590> you

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
of not totally clear every time what you

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.050 
of not totally clear every time what you
do<00:05:26.800> when<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.040> do<00:05:27.130> an<00:05:27.220> interrupt<00:05:27.580> for<00:05:27.700> example

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
do when you do an interrupt for example

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.820 
do when you do an interrupt for example
a<00:05:28.150> Shepherd<00:05:28.480> in<00:05:28.540> mass<00:05:28.660> spec<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.620> know<00:05:29.710> it's

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
a Shepherd in mass spec to you know it's

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.140 
a Shepherd in mass spec to you know it's
sort<00:05:29.890> of<00:05:30.010> Shepherd<00:05:30.370> raw<00:05:30.550> emotion<00:05:31.000> just

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
sort of Shepherd raw emotion just

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.550 
sort of Shepherd raw emotion just
flowing<00:05:31.390> out<00:05:31.600> what's<00:05:31.930> going<00:05:32.110> to<00:05:32.170> happen<00:05:32.440> it's

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
flowing out what's going to happen it's

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.680 
flowing out what's going to happen it's
crazy<00:05:32.800> right<00:05:33.100> but<00:05:33.430> it'll<00:05:34.000> be<00:05:34.090> fun<00:05:34.300> either<00:05:34.570> way

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
crazy right but it'll be fun either way

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.810 
crazy right but it'll be fun either way
so<00:05:35.380> I<00:05:35.770> think<00:05:36.100> those<00:05:36.220> are<00:05:36.250> both<00:05:36.490> valid

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
so I think those are both valid

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.210 
so I think those are both valid
expressions<00:05:37.540> of<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:38.020> storytelling<00:05:38.920> and

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
expressions of a storytelling and

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.440 
expressions of a storytelling and
they're<00:05:39.460> both<00:05:39.610> really<00:05:39.790> fun<00:05:40.030> to<00:05:40.120> play<00:05:40.300> through

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
they're both really fun to play through

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.400 
they're both really fun to play through
but<00:05:40.690> they're<00:05:40.840> they're<00:05:41.170> just<00:05:41.320> different

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
but they're they're just different

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.130 
but they're they're just different
varieties<00:05:41.980> of<00:05:42.010> authored<00:05:42.430> experiences<00:05:43.030> I<00:05:43.180> see

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
varieties of authored experiences I see

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.930 
varieties of authored experiences I see
that<00:05:44.290> I<00:05:44.440> see<00:05:44.620> video<00:05:44.830> games<00:05:45.070> as<00:05:45.250> an<00:05:45.400> art<00:05:45.490> form<00:05:45.580> I

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
that I see video games as an art form I

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.700 
that I see video games as an art form I
see<00:05:46.180> them<00:05:46.330> as<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:46.480> commercial<00:05:46.750> art<00:05:47.080> form<00:05:47.290> but

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
see them as a commercial art form but

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.950 
see them as a commercial art form but
nonetheless<00:05:48.070> and<00:05:48.520> I<00:05:48.550> think<00:05:48.790> it's<00:05:49.210> amazing<00:05:49.540> how

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
nonetheless and I think it's amazing how

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.990 
nonetheless and I think it's amazing how
video<00:05:50.500> games<00:05:50.620> continue<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.280> progress<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:51.820> think

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
video games continue to progress I think

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.630 
video games continue to progress I think
in<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.210> last<00:05:52.360> 30<00:05:52.690> years<00:05:52.770> we've<00:05:53.770> kind<00:05:54.370> of<00:05:54.430> built

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
in the last 30 years we've kind of built

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.250 
in the last 30 years we've kind of built
the<00:05:54.790> camera<00:05:55.300> on<00:05:55.450> which<00:05:55.780> we're<00:05:55.990> telling

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
the camera on which we're telling

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.110 
the camera on which we're telling
stories<00:05:56.650> and<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.250> next<00:05:57.460> 30<00:05:57.670> years<00:05:57.760> are<00:05:58.030> going

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
stories and the next 30 years are going

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.310 
stories and the next 30 years are going
to<00:05:58.180> be<00:05:58.240> even<00:05:58.330> better<00:05:58.540> I<00:05:58.690> think<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.960> best<00:05:59.110> stuff

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
to be even better I think the best stuff

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.140 
to be even better I think the best stuff
is<00:05:59.470> still<00:05:59.650> ahead<00:05:59.740> of<00:05:59.860> us<00:06:00.010> because<00:06:00.250> we're<00:06:01.030> now

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
is still ahead of us because we're now

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.210 
is still ahead of us because we're now
perfecting<00:06:01.840> the<00:06:01.930> craft<00:06:02.200> of<00:06:02.380> storytelling<00:06:03.040> and

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
perfecting the craft of storytelling and
