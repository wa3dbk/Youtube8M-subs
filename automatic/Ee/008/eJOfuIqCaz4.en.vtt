00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.950
 Talking galley on channel on skateboard 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.200
 today I will give it to you guys are going to do this 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.519
 ramp to give a time each of you 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.080
 the target is bigger in things 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.000
 different takes a look at the video that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 You now in step by step 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.510
 [Music] 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.880
 then everybody who will need to make 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.300
 our ramp two material tests here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.670
 For you, I started doing the sides. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.590
 I used a 20mm plate 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.150
 you can use one of 15 that is not the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.800
 important part of the structure 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 only this will give the format of the ramp 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.890
 and what I did I took a piece of 90 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.809
 centimeters for 30 days and real 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 diagonal to make the side streets of the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.290
 ramp then in the same piece as you 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.170
 makes use of both sides of the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.570
 ramp to the part of the ramp structure has 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.129
 that being wood can neither be nor 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.050
 mdp agglomerated those types of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.620
 material in opposite ways has to be 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.829
 wood 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.510
 So I got a wood here that is 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.190
 used a deed of a pallet 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.230
 I picked up at the supermarket personal request 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 Guys gave me I only know the size that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.240
 I wanted so I have to do 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 To measure the ramp I do it with 60 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 width 90 in length and 30 in height 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.650
 then you have to cut the wood - the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.200
 unilateral measure 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 then you can see that the structure has to 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 be two inches shorter on each side 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.990
 400 smaller total to fit the sides 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.200
 so we made cuts in barriers and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.060
 the top pieces I used two plates 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.590
 of 6 mm of 95 cm by 60 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.049
 wide and why I used two 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.240
 pieces to strengthen it you can 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.579
 use only one piece of 10 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.750
 only if you use the very thick piece 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.909
 You have to set up an iron plate. 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.119
 at the entrance to facilitate the entrance of the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.920
 ramp I'm going to use a screw here 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.649
 45 which is to escape four centimeters and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.240
 medium and I will use a drill with 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.710
 a drill and also a means 13 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.840
 screwdriver totaling the two 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.579
 treadmills with this one here with a drill, right? 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.829
 It's what I'm going to do, I'll get the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.549
 of the structure and accuse 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.469
 take the lateral line 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.060
 the 90 degree angle down here 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.319
 then the part left down 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.380
 I'll start to make mine. 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.680
 structure here 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.270
 so the pair the top to 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.290
 We put then from 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.180
 surface 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.650
 so I'm going to use the structure here and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.270
 I 'll show you 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.270
 each piece being paralyzed 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.210
 [Music] 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.000
 so guys I put the bass 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.070
 that goes well in the base that will stay 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.990
 on the floor and now I'm going to put 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.000
 structure so I'll put the 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.100
 first up here very well with the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.960
 end it flush with the top 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.560
 after that which will enter the play 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.630
 surface 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.940
 I'll leave the space to put another leave. 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.190
 space put another and so on 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.900
 already showing the whole process for you 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.910
 So I put it down from the bottom. 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.710
 the first fall of the sheet structure 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.960
 I'll put it next, I 'll do it. 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.080
 leave a space between them and I 'll go 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.910
 put the next one is more or less 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.770
 in this order you will put all 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.780
 On until I finish ramp I put 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.760
 all parts of the structure are missing last 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.650
 but not to put this piece of four 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.150
 by four centimeters she'll stay 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.880
 far from start as the ramp 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.590
 I decrease it I know it is in the middle so it has 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.930
 a piece two centimeters by four 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.820
 to put it well on the limit because 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.830
 otherwise it never deserved it was placed 44 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.300
 well below the limit here or to use 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.930
 she now shows how to put the 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.090
 key 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.810
 now who put the ways of 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.040
 structure I'll put the plate on top 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.910
 so here in the lower part I'm going to line up 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.590
 she with the top of the ramp put her 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.900
 with the side and to pierce her 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.430
 got the holes out of the wood and I'm going 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.220
 start to stick queue then from four to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.900
 five holes in each wood here to 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.900
 use the plate in the structure 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.670
 yesterday the first layer of six books 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.709
 I'll put another on top. 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.209
 Of course I made the futures of 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.340
 screws in a row and I can not 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.160
 hit them on top of them on the 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.110
 Up then I'll stick away from them and I 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.820
 I'll put the top layer up a little 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.560
 more out that is not to give a 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.090
 very strong impact on entry to 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.889
 stay very smooth entrance then guys 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.660
 finishing the field riding a tip that 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.639
 I'll give it to you to leave the entrance 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.950
 the softer it is to put an iron plate 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.660
 here at the entrance you'll only be the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.760
 holes and place screws 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.100
 screw head is also out 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.350
 a tip that will greatly facilitate the 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.630
 What you can do is close this 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.370
 ramp and placed in Brazil matters to 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.380
 you can double it save the parana 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.750
 It's very practical to load now, I'm going 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.350
 take this ramp here and we'll make a 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.350
 test with her 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.050
 [Music] 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.410
 now they will vote white ac 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.010
 Let's see if anything goes on this one. 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:18.530
 confirm that the high 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.530
 employment also talk some tribe 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.240
 That's it guys, this was the video like 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.729
 make a ramp soon I 'm already 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.139
 making more obstacle videos and 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.610
 court over skateboard if you have 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.080
 any doubt about skateboarding 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.879
 just see your own message networks 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.599
 social do not forget to sign up 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.259
 on our channel 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:49.150
 Okay, and the next one said good to everyone. 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.189
 where we made to fix the floor well 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.569
 where the amendment may be much easier 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:57.279
 to heal all the internet footage 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.050
 decided to make a video where he will teach 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.360
 to you how to make your own support 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:07.119
 spending less 10 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.119
