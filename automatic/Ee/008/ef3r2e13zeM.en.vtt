00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 good and good boys and girls friends 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.620
 of digital netean how about how are you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.940
 today trujillo and we are here in a new 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.460
 video of grand theft auto 5 I'm going to 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.230
 explain a little glitch that I've 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 found no and well here you see that 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.849
 I have my bugatti veyron or good 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.270
 version of gta 5 and I will teach how 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.800
 repair it for free is a sure clip 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.130
 so possibly in the future what 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.070
 patch but good for now we can 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.170
 use if you have a car like that exotic 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.400
 how is this that is found in few and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.019
 Of course I wanted to save it but in a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 journey home has happened this we 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.160
 missing doors here a piece of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.140
 body even if the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.980
 Well, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.350
 repair it for free with a simple step and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.910
 this step is also worth to us for life 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 to recover life as you see below 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.900
 I'm missing there as a quarter of life in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.960
 the bar of life 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.800
 and also we are worth to heal not no 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.590
 so look we just have to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.949
 we separate here and we change 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.540
 of character we change to frank time 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.830
 For example, it can not be clover 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.950
 I suppose 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.950
 and nothing we change to see if it charges 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.010
 now she is loading 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.080
 and we have franklin here in his car 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.760
 listening to black music now 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.290
 we go back to michael 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.370
 to see if it changes that sometimes it costs 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 a little 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.090
 and now when we come back we will be in the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.830
 same place where we have left 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.180
 because as the change has been rapid it is 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.810
 like the character has not given time 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.660
 to get to do their things so 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.810
 now we are here in the same place with 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.280
 maikel but with the car totally 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.570
 repaired and life if you notice me 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.130
 was missing a room because now it is 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.380
 totally full 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.920
 this as I say is a glitch I guess that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.560
 in the future the patch will do but good 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.479
 if you end up in a shootout and we are too lazy 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.490
 Go find a first-aid kit or a machine 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.799
 vending machine to drink something and cure 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.810
 it also comes well the car killed him 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.209
 same if you caught us away from the workshop 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.190
 I want to go or whatever or just do not 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.260
 I wanted to be in the pasta 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.989
 simply doing this that takes 10 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.660
 seconds you have it totally new 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.220
 it works perfectly because always 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.930
 It often happens that sometimes it hits you 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.130
 block a wheel maybe imagine 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.530
 you stay lying in the middle of the desert 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.239
 with a locked wheel and clear is a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.700
 putada and see what he does walk back 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.760
 you just do this and I think 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.500
 that take less is a trick a trap 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.599
 as you want to call it but you can well 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.620
 come well at certain times so 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.900
 nothing kids, I hope you liked it 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.569
 a short video 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.909
 but quite useful so you know if 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.970
 has been useful 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.560
 you can share it with our colleagues 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.329
 out there by twitter facebook and all 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.849
 those networks and you know if you liked it 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.579
 You can give me I like to add the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.370
 favorites and all things comment 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.349
 also if you want things that you want 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.260
 make the game new clips that you want 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.849
 that goes up that try or all those things and 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.299
 nothing a greeting and until the next 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.299
 goodbye
