explain how to do them that was the main
riff<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:47.719> starts<00:00:48.079> on<00:00:48.260> 7<00:00:48.980> on<00:00:49.159> the<00:00:49.249> high<00:00:49.370> E<00:00:49.399> string

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
riff it starts on 7 on the high E string

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.819 
riff it starts on 7 on the high E string
and<00:00:50.569> 2<00:00:51.350> 5<00:00:51.589> on<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:52.659> then<00:00:53.659> you<00:00:53.780> would<00:00:53.899> slide<00:00:54.170> 5

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
and 2 5 on the a then you would slide 5

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.469 
and 2 5 on the a then you would slide 5
to<00:00:55.129> 7<00:00:57.309> all<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.429> way<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.579> do<00:00:58.729> a<00:00:58.760> slide<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.269> like

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
to 7 all the way to do a slide is like

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.649 
to 7 all the way to do a slide is like
this<00:00:59.629> so<00:00:59.839> you'll<00:00:59.960> play<00:01:00.079> 5<00:01:00.879> still<00:01:01.879> Y<00:01:02.120> whilst

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
this so you'll play 5 still Y whilst

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.110 
this so you'll play 5 still Y whilst
applying<00:01:03.350> pressure<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.190> would<00:01:04.250> slide<00:01:04.790> that

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
applying pressure you would slide that

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.120 
applying pressure you would slide that
finger<00:01:05.510> up<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.780> 7<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.030> 7<00:01:08.030> again<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:09.649> next<00:01:09.860> part

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
finger up to 7 and 7 again the next part

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.120 
finger up to 7 and 7 again the next part
is<00:01:10.310> between<00:01:10.909> alternates<00:01:11.810> between<00:01:11.960> 10<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.710> 9

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
is between alternates between 10 and 9

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.120 
is between alternates between 10 and 9
and<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:13.520> do<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:13.759> 3<00:01:14.000> times<00:01:14.180> 1<00:01:15.100> 2<00:01:16.479> 3<00:01:17.710> down<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.890> 5

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
and you do this 3 times 1 2 3 down to 5

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.770 
and you do this 3 times 1 2 3 down to 5
on<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.490> 8th

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
on the 8th

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.760 
on the 8th
then<00:01:21.049> slide<00:01:21.530> 5<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.010> 7

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
then slide 5 to 7

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.170 
then slide 5 to 7
you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
you

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
you
all<00:01:26.170> right<00:01:26.260> let's<00:01:26.500> try<00:01:26.650> that<00:01:26.710> all<00:01:26.890> together

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:02:00.450 

and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:39.450> interlude<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:58.470> cup<00:01:59.470> so<00:02:00.220> it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
and then that is interlude a cup so it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.090 
and then that is interlude a cup so it
was<00:02:00.640> double<00:02:01.060> 7<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.570> high<00:02:01.720> E<00:02:01.750> string<00:02:02.940> 5<00:02:03.940> on

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
was double 7 on the high E string 5 on

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.050 
was double 7 on the high E string 5 on
a7<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.490> high<00:02:06.729> e<00:02:06.759> 6<00:02:08.100> whoops<00:02:09.119> trouble<00:02:10.119> 5

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
a7 and high e 6 whoops trouble 5

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.809 
a7 and high e 6 whoops trouble 5
and<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:12.750> you'll<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> hammer-on<00:02:13.830> between

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and then you'll do a hammer-on between

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.780 
and then you'll do a hammer-on between
zero<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.630> open<00:02:16.110> e<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.500> four<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.489> foot<00:02:17.670> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
zero and open e and four on the foot and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.240 
zero and open e and four on the foot and
the<00:02:18.000> 4th<00:02:18.239> fret<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.950> don't<00:02:20.069> know<00:02:20.130> what<00:02:20.220> a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the 4th fret if you don't know what a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.360 
the 4th fret if you don't know what a
hammer-on<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.819> let's<00:02:21.569> try<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.750> explain<00:02:22.050> it

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
hammer-on is let's try to explain it

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.970 
hammer-on is let's try to explain it
hammer<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.730> when<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:23.970> play<00:02:24.290> well<00:02:25.290> two

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
hammer on is when you play well two

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.000 
hammer on is when you play well two
notes<00:02:26.220> you'll<00:02:27.209> pick<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.420> first<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.110> then<00:02:28.830> you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
notes you'll pick the first and then you

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.580 
notes you'll pick the first and then you
flick<00:02:29.430> your<00:02:29.459> finger<00:02:29.670> press<00:02:30.330> down<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.260> next

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
flick your finger press down on the next

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.070 
flick your finger press down on the next
note<00:02:31.849> as<00:02:32.849> hard<00:02:33.090> as<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.300> can<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:34.440> produce

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
note as hard as you can to produce

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.740 
note as hard as you can to produce
slightly<00:02:37.080> different<00:02:37.319> sound<00:02:38.150> after<00:02:39.150> zero<00:02:39.450> for

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
slightly different sound after zero for

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.890 
slightly different sound after zero for
it<00:02:40.530> goes<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:41.010> double<00:02:42.000> five<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.440> six<00:02:44.900> let's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it goes to double five and six let's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.420 
it goes to double five and six let's
play<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.230> part<00:02:46.440> again

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.890 

you<00:02:53.430> repeat<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.060> would<00:02:54.300> repeat<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.660> twice

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
you repeat you would repeat that twice

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.990 
you repeat you would repeat that twice
and<00:02:55.380> then<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.370> next<00:02:56.580> part<00:02:57.240> which<00:02:57.480> is

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.350 

double<00:03:03.000> 7<00:03:04.040> 5<00:03:05.040> &amp;<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.390> factor<00:03:06.390> 7<00:03:07.010> 6<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:09.210> then

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
double 7 5 &amp; a factor 7 6 and then

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.680 
double 7 5 &amp; a factor 7 6 and then
trouble<00:03:09.780> 5<00:03:11.060> followed<00:03:12.060> by<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.210> two<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.570> half

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
trouble 5 followed by a two and a half

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.400 
trouble 5 followed by a two and a half
bit<00:03:12.870> rest

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
bit rest

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.340 
bit rest
okay<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.910> was<00:03:15.000> interlude<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.050> next

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
okay so that was interlude a the next

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.270 
okay so that was interlude a the next
part<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.610> bridge<00:03:17.820> section<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:19.280> we're

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
part is the bridge section and we're

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.040 
part is the bridge section and we're
going<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.460> do<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.550> power<00:03:20.790> chord<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.240> it's

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
going to do a power chord for this it's

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.530 
going to do a power chord for this it's
