00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
because of server like and people

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.280 
because of server like and people
messing<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:40.079> school

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
you look at the pressure plate design

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.580 
you look at the pressure plate design
that<00:04:38.700> was<00:04:38.820> ages<00:04:39.270> needed<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.720> go<00:04:39.840> when<00:04:40.050> there

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
that was ages needed to go when there

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.470 
that was ages needed to go when there
wasn't<00:04:40.800> any<00:04:41.190> other<00:04:41.430> blocks<00:04:42.000> we<00:04:42.240> could<00:04:42.390> have

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
wasn't any other blocks we could have

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.480 
wasn't any other blocks we could have
used<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.380> that's<00:04:43.560> why<00:04:43.740> all<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.980> tables<00:04:44.340> look

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
used so that's why all the tables look

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.750 
used so that's why all the tables look
awful<00:04:44.940> in<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:46.560> older<00:04:46.830> places<00:04:47.220> i<00:04:47.370> don't
