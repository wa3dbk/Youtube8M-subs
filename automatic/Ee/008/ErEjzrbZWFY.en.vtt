your<00:00:25.270> nano<00:00:25.420> CPX<00:00:25.900> for<00:00:26.110> a<00:00:26.170> while<00:00:26.350> you've

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
your nano CPX for a while you've

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.820 
your nano CPX for a while you've
probably<00:00:27.100> banged<00:00:27.789> it<00:00:27.940> up<00:00:28.030> a<00:00:28.180> little<00:00:28.270> bit<00:00:28.510> and

order to actually loosen the spindle in

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.750 
order to actually loosen the spindle in
the<00:01:23.630> head<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.440> take<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.100> spindle<00:01:25.430> tool<00:01:25.580> on

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
the head so you take the spindle tool on

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.310 
the head so you take the spindle tool on
both<00:01:25.970> sides<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:28.509> might<00:01:29.509> need<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.780> twist<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.200> few

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
both sides you might need to twist a few

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
times to make sure that actually engages

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.590 
times to make sure that actually engages
the<00:01:32.360> spindle<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.990> nut<00:01:33.550> and<00:01:34.550> then<00:01:35.330> you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the spindle on the nut and then you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.530 
the spindle on the nut and then you
simply<00:01:36.050> unscrew<00:01:36.979> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.160 

and<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:46.470> head<00:01:46.650> will<00:01:46.980> simply<00:01:47.460> separate<00:01:48.170> now

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and the head will simply separate now

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.100 
and the head will simply separate now
what<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.940> pull<00:01:51.300> pull<00:01:51.990> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
this is a good time to replace the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.340 
this is a good time to replace the
dampeners<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> head<00:02:20.250> if<00:02:20.490> if<00:02:21.390> you've<00:02:22.230> been

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
dampeners in the head if if you've been

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.260 
dampeners in the head if if you've been
flying<00:02:22.560> your<00:02:22.890> nano<00:02:23.100> CPX<00:02:23.610> for<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.850> while<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
flying your nano CPX for a while you

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.000 
flying your nano CPX for a while you
need<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> replace<00:02:24.720> your<00:02:24.780> dampeners<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
need to replace your dampeners this is a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.790 
need to replace your dampeners this is a
great<00:02:26.250> opportunity<00:02:27.170> what<00:02:28.170> I'd<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.530> do<00:02:28.680> is

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
great opportunity what I'd like to do is

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.590 
great opportunity what I'd like to do is
I<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.220> actually<00:02:29.550> use<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.180> end<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
I like to actually use the end of the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.580 
I like to actually use the end of the
spindle<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:32.090> use<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.600> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.900> pry<00:02:34.200> out

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
spindle and use that to kind of pry out

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.300 
spindle and use that to kind of pry out
the<00:02:36.140> dampeners<00:02:37.140> makes<00:02:37.680> things<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:38.010> little<00:02:38.130> bit

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the dampeners makes things a little bit

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.860 
the dampeners makes things a little bit
easier<00:02:38.490> especially<00:02:38.820> if<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:39.360> big<00:02:39.570> hands

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
easier especially if you have big hands

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.830 
easier especially if you have big hands
such<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.440> myself<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.390> once<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.720> to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
such as myself so once you have to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.290 
such as myself so once you have to
dampen<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.260> out<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.950> simply<00:02:44.400> remove<00:02:45.090> them

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
dampen this out and simply remove them

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.800 
dampen this out and simply remove them
and<00:02:45.540> replace<00:02:45.960> them<00:02:46.020> with<00:02:46.290> new<00:02:46.770> ones<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.750> I'm

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
and replace them with new ones so I'm

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.420 
and replace them with new ones so I'm
going<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:48.990> reinstall<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.590> dampener<00:02:50.070> here

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.010
