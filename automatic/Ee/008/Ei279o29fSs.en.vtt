00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 the Paleozoic era is a generation of 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.090
 transit between a ways of life 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.840
 still 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.969
 are not invertebrates and vertebrates and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.710
 of life exclusively at sea to the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 conquest of the land by 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.850
 animals and plants 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.430
 it was precisely at the beginning of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.189
 period when the serious ones begin to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.169
 present a more notorious development and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.599
 these species formed a structure 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.880
 more complex so the fight for 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.100
 survival increased according to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.010
 the evolved species 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.140
 in this struggle for survival the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.480
 species were forced to evolve 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.280
 or die what led to life 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.050
 achieve greater diversity in the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.059
 species this was 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.059
 in which the ancestors emerge 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.699
 ickowicz is who is evolution assumes the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.699
 start even of the expression 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.440
 evolution has not only been achieved in 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.940
 the species but on the planet thank you 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.370
 to the evolution of the plants themselves 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 that at first they hardly had the 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.210
 ability to adapt to the tense environment 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.520
 that existed 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.409
 we can appreciate the vast forests of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.880
 planet that have been developing 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.880
 from the Devonian period 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.620
 in this new medium some 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.910
 yes 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.800
 what they start to develop 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.080
 limbs that allow them 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.550
 settle out of the water the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.100
 odds of surviving in the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.780
 marine environment were reduced 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.780
 evolution of the strongest species 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.130
 time after the conquest of the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 land for these species 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.900
 the adaptation requires an improvement 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.120
 because there were still defects that could 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.220
 cause its extinction so the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.170
 Eggs that they left before now are 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.520
 hard boiled eggs to allow them 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.520
 develop on land 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.740
 turning them into the first reptiles 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.600
 from the land in but other species already 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.460
 they had adapted to the earth 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.990
 putting now another proof of 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.090
 survival in the Carboniferous period 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.030
 300 million years ago the flora 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.620
 arrives has evolved considerably 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.670
 creating an oxygen production of 40 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.010
 percent higher than today 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.690
 as a consequence the habitat was seen 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.700
 favored for insects that 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.280
 they were getting bigger and bigger and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.920
 amphibians who acquired jaws and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.430
 stronger teeth 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.300
 more not for reptiles these insects 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.069
 reached in the size of one meter or more 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.459
 like the dragonflies that had the size 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.440
 of an eagle in this way achieving 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.560
 the dominant ones during a lapse of this 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.040
 period however these conditions 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.500
 caused strong climate changes 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.599
 It was the right environment for 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.370
 generate thunderstorms that 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.700
 they managed to make big fires in the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.750
 habitat 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.780
 ending with almost everything that ended 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.430
 at the height of insects 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.530
 after the catastrophe by the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.220
 storms the climate has been affected by 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.820
 such that there was an instability 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.860
 that had an impact on the fauna 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.910
 the coldest winters and droughts 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.070
 more extensive 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.230
 but this helped species like 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.740
 reptiles evolve and adapt with 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.300
 more easily the domain was now of 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.670
 the reptiles 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.670
 in the terrestrial habitat 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.760
 the insects that 50 million of 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.459
 years dominated bean do not represent any 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.750
 danger for the species because its size 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.750
 it was reduced to centimeters 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.700
 and yet the adaptation of 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.610
 species was not enough for this 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.010
 new proof that nature imposed 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.830
 so it did increase over time in 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.960
 its last stage of the Paleozoic era the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.370
 superior permian where the species already 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.730
 had reached thousands of years of 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.980
 evolution now they are already reduced to much 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.110
 less than half of its population and 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.110
 even less than the fourth of what it was
