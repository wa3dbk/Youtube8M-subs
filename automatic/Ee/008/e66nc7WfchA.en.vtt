going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.100> villains<00:01:08.640> now<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.960> guess

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
going to be villains now the the I guess

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.780 
going to be villains now the the I guess
the<00:01:10.350> idea<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> don't<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.549> know

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the idea is because I don't really know

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
the idea is because I don't really know
who<00:01:11.939> Quicksilver<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.080> having<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409

anarchistic out this last night and I
went<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.430> looked<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.180> my

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
went and looked it up and I was doing my

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.520 
went and looked it up and I was doing my
research<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.960> everything<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
research on it and everything and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190 
research on it and everything and
basically<00:01:20.159> Quicksilver<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> me<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
basically Quicksilver to me is like the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
basically Quicksilver to me is like the
Avengers<00:01:22.770> version<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> flash<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.810> he

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
Avengers version of the flash because he

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.600 
Avengers version of the flash because he
could<00:01:25.170> basically<00:01:25.350> run<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.860> supersonic<00:01:26.189> speeds

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
could basically run at supersonic speeds

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
could basically run at supersonic speeds
and<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.659> might<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.960> why<00:01:28.080> he's<00:01:28.259> called

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and that might be why he's called

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
and that might be why he's called
Quicksilver<00:01:29.009> although<00:01:29.509> nowhere<00:01:30.509> near<00:01:30.659> as

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
Quicksilver although nowhere near as

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
Quicksilver although nowhere near as
good<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.350> name<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.070> flash<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.549> his

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
good of a name as the flash but his

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.600 
good of a name as the flash but his
entire<00:01:33.329> storyline<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.200> he<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.560> Magneto<00:01:35.100> son

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
entire storyline is he is Magneto son

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.590 
entire storyline is he is Magneto son
right<00:01:36.210> his<00:01:36.329> name<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.630> uh<00:01:37.159> pa<00:01:38.159> pa<00:01:38.670> door<00:01:38.939> maximov

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
right his name is uh pa pa door maximov

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.539 
right his name is uh pa pa door maximov
right<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.990> he<00:01:43.229> Magneto's<00:01:44.100> son<00:01:44.340> well

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
right and and so he Magneto's son well

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
right and and so he Magneto's son well
okay<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.479> x-men<00:01:45.810> days<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> future<00:01:46.140> past<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
okay so an x-men days of future past and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.580 
okay so an x-men days of future past and
it<00:01:46.860> makes<00:01:47.009> sense<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.939> he's<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.560> know

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it makes sense because he's you know

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
it makes sense because he's you know
Magneto's<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.509> might

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
Magneto's there right and so they might

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.289 
Magneto's there right and so they might
play<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> don't<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.729> Evan

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
play that in but I don't know if Evan

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.170 
play that in but I don't know if Evan

that<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.340> I'm<00:03:48.400> thinking<00:03:48.580> thinking<00:03:49.270> it<00:03:49.420> might

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
that and I'm thinking thinking it might

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.060 
that and I'm thinking thinking it might
I<00:03:49.720> could<00:03:49.930> be<00:03:50.050> wrong<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:50.260> I'm<00:03:50.530> thinking<00:03:50.830> it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
I could be wrong but I'm thinking it

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.500 
I could be wrong but I'm thinking it
might<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.459> been<00:03:51.550> let's<00:03:51.790> see<00:03:52.000> what<00:03:52.180> happens

are going to care right or going to
notice<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.970> that's<00:04:55.180> that's<00:04:55.419> an

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
notice and that's that's an

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.390 
notice and that's that's an
honest-to-god<00:04:56.080> thing<00:04:56.320> so<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.560> never<00:04:57.160> really

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
honest-to-god thing so you never really

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.830 
honest-to-god thing so you never really
know<00:04:57.639> it<00:04:57.790> could<00:04:57.880> be<00:04:57.970> anything<00:04:58.270> with<00:04:58.539> that<00:04:58.570> so

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
know it could be anything with that so

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.939 
know it could be anything with that so
