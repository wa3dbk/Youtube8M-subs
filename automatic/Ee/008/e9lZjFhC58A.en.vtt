this<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.269> my<00:00:12.389> collection<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:13.110> recently

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
this one in my collection I recently

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.959 
this one in my collection I recently
just<00:00:13.590> spruced<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.070> up<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.340> made<00:00:14.460> sheath<00:00:14.730> for

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
just spruced it up and made sheath for

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.470 
just spruced it up and made sheath for
it<00:00:15.170> to<00:00:16.170> sell<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:17.240> these<00:00:18.240> were<00:00:18.420> originally

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
it to sell and these were originally

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.710 
it to sell and these were originally
designed<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.350> customer<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.800> mine<00:00:19.980> who<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.720> a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
designed for a customer of mine who is a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189 
designed for a customer of mine who is a
circle<00:00:22.260> marine<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.630> he<00:00:24.630> wanted<00:00:24.960> something

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
circle marine and he wanted something

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.509 
circle marine and he wanted something
that<00:00:25.439> he<00:00:25.500> could<00:00:25.619> take<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> field<00:00:26.250> when<00:00:26.430> he

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that he could take in the field when he

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.999 
that he could take in the field when he
deployed<00:00:27.390> overseas<00:00:28.820> year<00:00:29.820> or<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.029> back<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
deployed overseas year or two back and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
deployed overseas year or two back and
so<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> made<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.730> small<00:00:33.000> batch<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> about<00:00:33.480> 27

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
so I made this small batch of about 27

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.490 
so I made this small batch of about 27
knives<00:00:34.340> which<00:00:35.340> he<00:00:35.489> took<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.820> six<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.300> them

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
knives which he took about six of them

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.540 
knives which he took about six of them
for<00:00:37.500> him<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> some<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> people<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.430> his<00:00:38.520> team

through the shoulder clavicle obviously
if<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> clerical<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.449> could<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.230> wrong

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
if it's the clerical I could be wrong

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.250 
if it's the clerical I could be wrong
not<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> doctor<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.960> basically<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.140> know

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
not a doctor but basically you know

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
piercing the heart if you need to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.410 
piercing the heart if you need to
dispatch<00:01:06.150> something<00:01:06.799> or<00:01:07.799> someone<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
dispatch something or someone but at the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
dispatch something or someone but at the
same<00:01:09.630> time<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.530> need<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> utility<00:01:11.490> knife

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
same time it need to be a utility knife

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
same time it need to be a utility knife
for<00:01:11.850> everyday<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.869> reality

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
for everyday use because in reality

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
for everyday use because in reality
that's<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.100> put<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that's what it was going to get put to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
that's what it was going to get put to
most<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.500> ever<00:01:16.500> need<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.890> good

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
most of the time ever need to be good

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
most of the time ever need to be good
corrosion<00:01:17.310> resistance<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.390> tough<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
corrosion resistance and tough so this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
corrosion resistance and tough so this
is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> ridiculously<00:01:20.400> overbuilt<00:01:20.909> knife<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
is a ridiculously overbuilt knife this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
is a ridiculously overbuilt knife this
still<00:01:21.900> has<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> keen<00:01:22.350> edge<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.950> over<00:01:23.310> quarter

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
still has a keen edge it's over quarter

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.600 
still has a keen edge it's over quarter
of<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.729> inch<00:01:23.820> thick<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:25.710> uses<00:01:26.070> still<00:01:26.310> clean

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of an inch thick that uses still clean

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
of an inch thick that uses still clean
six<00:01:26.880> seven<00:01:27.210> eight<00:01:27.330> which<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:29.090> kind<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.329> if

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
six seven eight which is kind of like if

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.149 
six seven eight which is kind of like if
you<00:01:30.659> could<00:01:30.750> imagine<00:01:30.990> almost<00:01:31.229> 440<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.009> on

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you could imagine almost 440 be on

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
you could imagine almost 440 be on
steroids<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.909> got<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.329> good<00:01:33.570> corrosion

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
steroids it's got a very good corrosion

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
steroids it's got a very good corrosion
resistance<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:35.520> also<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.820> two<00:01:36.030> percent

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
resistance it's also got two percent

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
resistance it's also got two percent
vanadium<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.829> keep<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> very

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
vanadium in it so it can keep a very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.590 
vanadium in it so it can keep a very
keen<00:01:38.790> edge<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.409> basically<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
keen edge you can see it's basically a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.160 
keen edge you can see it's basically a
big<00:01:42.600> sharp<00:01:42.930> edge<00:01:44.210> very<00:01:45.210> very<00:01:45.450> thick<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
big sharp edge very very thick so that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.050 
big sharp edge very very thick so that
they<00:01:46.320> could<00:01:46.619> use<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.040> prime<00:01:47.520> crates<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
they could use it for prime crates and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.859 
they could use it for prime crates and
things<00:01:48.350> as<00:01:49.350> well<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.680> its<00:01:49.829> main<00:01:50.040> job<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.720> it's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
things as well as its main job but it's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.960 
things as well as its main job but it's
also<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:52.829> sharp<00:01:53.369> enough<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> keen

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
also you know sharp enough and keen

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.280 
also you know sharp enough and keen
enough<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> edge<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.140> only

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
enough on the edge because it's only

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.350 
enough on the edge because it's only
about<00:01:55.439> 12<00:01:55.920> degrees<00:01:56.070> per<00:01:56.490> side<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> actual

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
about 12 degrees per side on the actual

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.870 
about 12 degrees per side on the actual
age<00:01:58.460> we've<00:01:59.460> got<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> fly<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.030> hand<00:02:00.710> for

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
age we've got to fly on my hand for

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.219
