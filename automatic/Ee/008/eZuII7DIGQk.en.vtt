00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.520 

a<00:01:02.780> green<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:05.869> there<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.290> two

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
a green one there are actually two

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
a green one there are actually two
versions<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.100> Montclair<00:01:08.580> I'm<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
versions of this Montclair I'm going to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450 
versions of this Montclair I'm going to
quickly<00:01:09.479> show<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> difference<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
quickly show you the difference so this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
quickly show you the difference so this
green<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.830> inside

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
green one here you can see on the inside

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
green one here you can see on the inside
that<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.580> no<00:01:14.850> there's<00:01:15.540> no<00:01:15.630> koala<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that is no there's no koala bit on the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.120 
that is no there's no koala bit on the
inside<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:22.909> collar<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.080> inside<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
inside here collar bit on the inside so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.440 
inside here collar bit on the inside so
that's<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> main<00:01:26.729> differences<00:01:26.939> guys

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that's one of the main differences guys

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.020 
that's one of the main differences guys
so<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> think<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.860> version<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.490> maybe<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so I think this version was maybe more a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.920 
so I think this version was maybe more a
winter<00:01:30.780> version<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.350> different<00:01:31.890> collection

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
winter version or different collection

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.539 
winter version or different collection
and<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> collection<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.400> out

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and this was a collection they go out

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.200 
and this was a collection they go out
afterwards<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.900> has<00:01:37.020> got<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
afterwards because this one has got the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.780 
afterwards because this one has got the
QR<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:40.229> one's<00:01:40.409> got<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> QR<00:01:40.890> code<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.670> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
QR this one's got a QR code there so we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.639 
QR this one's got a QR code there so we
noticed<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.150> 2014<00:01:42.840> jacket<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.380> can

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there you go so he's got a QR codes does

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.130 
there you go so he's got a QR codes does
that<00:01:49.229> mean<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> post-2014<00:01:50.220> jacket
