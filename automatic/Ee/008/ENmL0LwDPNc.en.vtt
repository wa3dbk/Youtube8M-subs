the<00:02:16.760> way<00:02:16.910> inside<00:02:17.420> there<00:02:18.040> which<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.160> okay

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
the way inside there which is okay

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.010 
the way inside there which is okay

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020

slide slot on the crankshaft as you can

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.870 
slide slot on the crankshaft as you can
see<00:02:30.560> you're<00:02:30.770> only<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> need<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.400> small

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
see you're only going to need a small

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.830 
see you're only going to need a small
portion<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.660> make<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:33.020> there<00:02:34.840> now

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
portion of it to make it on there now

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.360 
portion of it to make it on there now
make<00:02:36.020> sure<00:02:36.050> when<00:02:36.230> you're<00:02:36.709> doing<00:02:36.739> this<00:02:37.100> you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
make sure when you're doing this you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.570 
make sure when you're doing this you
make<00:02:37.520> sure<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.820> do<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.300> right<00:02:38.510> end

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
make sure you do it on the right end

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.070 
make sure you do it on the right end
because<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.730> slide<00:02:41.030> has<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.300> special<00:02:41.720> cutout

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
because this slide has a special cutout

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.120 
because this slide has a special cutout
on<00:02:42.110> one<00:02:42.560> end<00:02:42.770> right<00:02:43.610> here<00:02:44.440> that's<00:02:45.440> designed<00:02:45.890> to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
on one end right here that's designed to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.330 
on one end right here that's designed to
fit<00:02:46.900> right<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:48.019> these<00:02:48.110> matches<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.190> face

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
fit right in these matches on the face

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.229 
fit right in these matches on the face
so<00:02:52.340> that's<00:02:52.519> one<00:02:52.670> thing<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:52.880> got<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.150> be

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
so that's one thing you got to be

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.300 
so that's one thing you got to be
careful<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.830> I've<00:02:55.400> done<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:58.010> it

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
careful of but I've done this and it

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.600 
careful of but I've done this and it
seems<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.610> be<00:02:58.670> very<00:02:58.760> successful<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:01.430> no

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
seems to be very successful that no

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.910 
seems to be very successful that no
problems<00:03:02.000> with<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.480> most<00:03:03.410> importantly<00:03:03.860> I

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
problems with it and most importantly I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.430 
problems with it and most importantly I
didn't<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.580> worry<00:03:04.760> about<00:03:05.350> tapping<00:03:06.350> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
didn't have to worry about tapping the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.240 
didn't have to worry about tapping the
crankshaft<00:03:08.200> with<00:03:09.200> anyway<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:09.739> watch<00:03:09.950> brand

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
crankshaft with anyway just watch brand

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.590 
crankshaft with anyway just watch brand
new<00:03:10.370> minibike<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> kind<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.390> seemed<00:03:11.570> like

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
new minibike and you kind of seemed like

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:23.840 
new minibike and you kind of seemed like
a<00:03:12.040> something<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.070> might<00:03:13.280> not<00:03:13.430> want<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> do

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.180 

these<00:03:24.850> long<00:03:25.420> shank<00:03:25.690> lug<00:03:25.930> nuts<00:03:26.140> come<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.740> a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
these long shank lug nuts come in a

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.370 
these long shank lug nuts come in a
couple<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.580> lengths<00:03:28.000> I've<00:03:28.750> already<00:03:29.080> tried

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
couple of lengths I've already tried

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.150 
couple of lengths I've already tried
using<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.340> more<00:03:30.610> common<00:03:30.970> 3/4<00:03:31.660> length<00:03:31.900> in

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
using the more common 3/4 length in

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.800 
using the more common 3/4 length in
three-quarter<00:03:33.160> shank<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:33.910> they<00:03:34.660> don't

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
three-quarter shank and they don't

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.380 
three-quarter shank and they don't
really<00:03:34.930> work<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.200> well<00:03:35.970> they<00:03:36.970> only<00:03:37.000> grab<00:03:37.360> a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
really work that well they only grab a

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.940 
really work that well they only grab a
couple<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.900> threads<00:03:38.170> in<00:03:38.290> there<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.740> you<00:03:38.830> might

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
couple of threads in there so you might

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.470 
couple of threads in there so you might
have<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.220> go<00:03:39.340> up<00:03:39.460> to<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.670> 1<00:03:39.850> inch<00:03:40.000> shank<00:03:40.270> or

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
have to go up to the 1 inch shank or

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.420 
have to go up to the 1 inch shank or
what<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.660> did<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.020> I<00:03:41.110> went<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.470> 1.3<00:03:42.250> inch

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
what I did is I went to the 1.3 inch

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.060 
what I did is I went to the 1.3 inch
shank<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.270> just<00:03:43.600> took<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.500> little<00:03:44.800> bit<00:03:45.010> of

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
shank and just took up a little bit of

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.300 
shank and just took up a little bit of
extra<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:46.140> shank<00:03:47.140> length<00:03:47.380> with<00:03:47.770> two

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
extra of the shank length with two

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.150 
extra of the shank length with two
washers<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.730> there<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.820> have<00:03:51.850> it
