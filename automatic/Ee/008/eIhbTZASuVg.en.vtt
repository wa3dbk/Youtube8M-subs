has to generate the hope was that they

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
has to generate the hope was that they
have<00:00:55.739> time<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.160> grow<00:00:56.399> new<00:00:56.610> lung<00:00:56.850> tissue

have time to grow new lung tissue
healthy<00:00:57.899> lung<00:00:58.079> tissue<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.879> scary<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
healthy lung tissue so it was scary it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
healthy lung tissue so it was scary it
was<00:01:00.809> very<00:01:00.989> scary<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.530> even<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:02.550> we

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
was very scary because even when we

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.340 
was very scary because even when we
thought<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:03.000> were<00:01:03.059> doing<00:01:03.270> good<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> things

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
thought they were doing good and things

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.859 
thought they were doing good and things
were<00:01:04.470> getting<00:01:04.559> better<00:01:05.299> we<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.420> constantly

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
were getting better we were constantly
