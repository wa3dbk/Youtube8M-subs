detailed<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:14.570> started<00:00:15.570> out<00:00:15.719> with<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.859> project

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
detailed I started out with this project

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.450 
detailed I started out with this project
by<00:00:18.170> scaling<00:00:19.170> down<00:00:19.410> from<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> real<00:00:19.920> truck

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
by scaling down from the real truck

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.500 
by scaling down from the real truck
everything<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.390> 1/8<00:00:22.050> scale<00:00:22.369> made<00:00:23.369> some<00:00:24.300> rough

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
everything is 1/8 scale made some rough

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.120 
everything is 1/8 scale made some rough
drawings<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> put<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> measurements<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
drawings and put the measurements on it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
drawings and put the measurements on it
so<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.460> had<00:00:26.580> something<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> go<00:00:27.029> by<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> then

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so I had something to go by and then

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.810 
so I had something to go by and then
about<00:00:27.779> 30<00:00:28.019> pictures<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.619> so

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
about 30 pictures or so

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.530 
about 30 pictures or so
just<00:00:31.820> started<00:00:32.540> one<00:00:32.689> piece<00:00:32.899> at<00:00:33.020> a<00:00:33.079> time<00:00:34.540> added

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
just started one piece at a time added

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.750 
just started one piece at a time added
details<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.140> went<00:00:36.260> along<00:00:36.320> my<00:00:37.129> challenge<00:00:37.550> was

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
details that went along my challenge was

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.520 
details that went along my challenge was
to<00:00:37.940> try<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.420> get<00:00:38.629> it<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.809> look<00:00:38.930> like<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.110> real<00:00:39.379> one

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
to try to get it to look like a real one

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.729 
to try to get it to look like a real one
and<00:00:40.520> work<00:00:41.270> does<00:00:41.480> not<00:00:41.510> look<00:00:41.840> like<00:00:41.870> would<00:00:42.199> it's

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
and work does not look like would it's

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.220 
and work does not look like would it's
not<00:00:43.160> even

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
not even

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.049 
not even
9%<00:00:44.649> would<00:00:45.010> probably<00:00:45.489> about<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.760> only<00:00:45.820> thing

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
9% would probably about the only thing

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.209 
9% would probably about the only thing
that's<00:00:46.179> not<00:00:46.239> weird<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:46.839> rubber<00:00:47.019> hoses<00:00:47.500> so

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
that's not weird is the rubber hoses so

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
that's not weird is the rubber hoses so
even<00:00:48.489> these<00:00:48.609> tires<00:00:48.909> are<00:00:49.239> all<00:00:49.390> over<00:00:50.230> in<00:00:50.379> would

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
even these tires are all over in would

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.509 
even these tires are all over in would
use<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.930> router<00:00:53.469> with<00:00:53.649> a<00:00:53.680> sixteenth<00:00:54.100> inch<00:00:54.280> bit

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
use the router with a sixteenth inch bit

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.799 
use the router with a sixteenth inch bit
to<00:00:54.550> get<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.449> trap<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.640> what<00:00:57.909> model<00:00:58.239> Peterbilt

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
to get the trap and what model Peterbilt

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.850 
to get the trap and what model Peterbilt
is<00:00:58.960> this<00:00:59.170> it's<00:00:59.739> a<00:01:00.119> 379<00:01:01.119> shorten<00:01:01.899> that's<00:01:02.619> got<00:01:02.829> a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
is this it's a 379 shorten that's got a

complete ring just to get a small second

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.870 
complete ring just to get a small second
I<00:01:56.619> needed<00:01:56.920> which<00:01:57.040> would<00:01:57.189> be<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.430> piece<00:01:57.610> that's

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
I needed which would be the piece that's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.149 
I needed which would be the piece that's
there<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.930> top<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.619> there<00:01:59.710> goes<00:01:59.860> from

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
there to top the in and there goes from

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.690

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.990 
the air intake to the intercooler sure
doesn't<00:02:06.970> look<00:02:07.119> like<00:02:07.210> wood<00:02:08.610> lots<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.729> primer

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
doesn't look like wood lots of primer
