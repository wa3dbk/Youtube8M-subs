 has the option of voltage at 110 volts or 220 volts 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.679
 the other models are produced at voltage 220 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.369
 observe the alert tag 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.369
 never connect the appliance without water in the tank 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 otherwise the water pump may burn 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 the air conditioner consists of a housing

 internally by the buoy 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.480
 and by the swell of water

 sons three screws the rate before would allow the float cock 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.580
 it can be observed that through this a bm that the regulation of the bay is made 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.940
 in this particular case the only one is regulated to 2 pounds of pressure 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.550
 the bigger angle celebrates that it will give to the pressure of the hydraulic network 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.940
 after adjusting the float again, note that in the part 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.340
 internal lid there is a goal of made of pvc 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.440
 this half must always remain on the bottom in order not to stain the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.979
 after securing the cap 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.979
 include the nozzle nozzle 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.329
 an observation 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.370
 centralize the hub so that it is at a uniform distance from the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.109
 the tip of the nozzle should be cut 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.949
 and then the south regulation should be done with the disc jig the nozzle 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.370
 the distance between the nozzle and the disc can not rest against the disc 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.370
 should be on average two to three millimeters 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.360

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.589
 then the 'motor' 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.710
 Do not forget to replace the paints 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.280
 how to know if the bomb burned for lack of water in the reservoir if obama 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.580
 are hoed or with the label glued inside it the reason for burning the missing

 of water in the reservoir 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.599
 in this case the warranty does not cover the replacement of the damaged part 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:43.860
 use

 this will be the new face of the air conditioners 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.199
 and its openness to maintenance is facilitated 

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:30.399
 be sure that maintenance and cleaning procedures 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:33.360
 increase the service life of the 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.190
 besides providing better results
