00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.330
 after the seventh generation of golf 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.660
 last year here is another icon 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.490
 the 7th golf gti actually volkswagen in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 offers from the outset two versions one gti 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 normal 220 horsepower and a version 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 230 horsepower performance 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.100
 both using the same 2 liters 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.420
 supercharged all the gti are entitled to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.369
 Fog using placed 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 vertically and a red border between 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.090
 the headlights the performance version that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.340
 we try here is recognizing the logo 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.710
 Gti painted in white on the front calipers 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.020
 in addition to 17-inch clothes for 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 connoisseurs only so for the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 gt enthusiasts there is an imperative to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.989
 inside find the tiles on 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.030
 saddlery exist and we have in 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 more optional the edges of seats in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.660
 alcantara customization by 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 compared to other golfs holds to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 some red stitching a logo on 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.000
 the steering wheel and a knob of leverage 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.280
 gears in golf balls but 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 only on the mechanical gearbox your 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 gti boxed performance dsg6 must be 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
 go to the back nothing to report put to 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.400
 share the bench that takes the famous 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.439
 tile generous livability for the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.330
 category as well as the check mark 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.460
 our performance goes from 0 to 100 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.439
 in 6 seconds 4 one tenth less 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.180
 what age is it normal for its hp 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.530
 the biggest difference does not come 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.360
 chrono but the presence of a 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.310
 self-locking on the performance version 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.140
 this allows a better motor skills in 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.820
 turn exit in both versions 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.470
 the sound worked is rather 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.360
 nice our pavement version 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.189
 huge 19-inch wheels went 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.050
 shown very dynamic but too 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.030
 uncomfortable on degraded pavement 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.950
 the suspensions piloted the rise of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 series is satisfied with 17 inches more 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.030
 reasonable for the rest the box dsg 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.620
 always does wonders even though the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990
 president of Coc on sale of beef 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.970
 the golf gti expensive not less 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.800
 thirty-two thousand euros and 1000 more 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.270
 for the performance version in 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.280
 counterparty she offers herself the luxury of 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 stay under 140 grams per km of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.800
 co2 in these two variants 220 or 230 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.270
 horses in mechanical box 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.070
 this new generation of golf gti 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.780
 therefore progresses both in performance 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.180
 in behavior and consumption 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 but there is no break no 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.660
 real astonishment this gti very 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.660
 rational also remains a golf
