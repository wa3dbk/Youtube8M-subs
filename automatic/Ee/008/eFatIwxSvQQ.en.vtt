Canaday<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:18.980> today<00:00:19.370> we're<00:00:19.550> talking<00:00:19.730> about

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
Canaday and today we're talking about

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.210 
Canaday and today we're talking about
basic<00:00:20.690> running<00:00:20.960> form<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:21.320> help<00:00:21.500> improve<00:00:21.950> your

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
basic running form to help improve your

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.040 
basic running form to help improve your
efficiency<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:22.939> hopefully<00:00:23.540> prevent<00:00:23.900> some

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
efficiency and hopefully prevent some

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.240 
efficiency and hopefully prevent some
injuries<00:00:29.079> so<00:00:30.079> a<00:00:30.110> common<00:00:30.439> mistake<00:00:30.590> we<00:00:30.860> see<00:00:31.040> with

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
injuries so a common mistake we see with

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.280 
injuries so a common mistake we see with
a<00:00:31.279> lot<00:00:31.369> of<00:00:31.700> runners<00:00:31.939> myself<00:00:32.599> included<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.170> what

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
a lot of runners myself included is what

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.200 
a lot of runners myself included is what
I<00:00:33.380> call<00:00:33.620> sitting<00:00:34.100> in<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.550> saddle<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.060> means

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
I call sitting in the saddle it means

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.580 
I call sitting in the saddle it means
you're<00:00:35.329> kind<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.600> running<00:00:35.900> like<00:00:36.440> you're

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
you're kind of running like you're

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.380 
you're kind of running like you're
sitting<00:00:36.890> down<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.340> chair<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.940> you're

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
sitting down in a chair and you're

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.510 
sitting down in a chair and you're
writing<00:00:38.600> your<00:00:38.810> hips<00:00:39.020> really<00:00:39.260> low<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.890> this<00:00:40.370> is

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
writing your hips really low and this is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.160 
writing your hips really low and this is
a<00:00:40.550> problem<00:00:40.880> for<00:00:40.910> several<00:00:41.210> reasons<00:00:41.750> because<00:00:41.989> it

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
a problem for several reasons because it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.850 
a problem for several reasons because it
means<00:00:42.440> you're<00:00:43.070> not<00:00:43.220> working<00:00:43.640> with<00:00:43.670> your<00:00:44.030> body

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
means you're not working with your body

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.470 
means you're not working with your body
as<00:00:45.860> efficiently<00:00:46.460> as<00:00:46.580> you<00:00:46.610> can<00:00:46.730> be<00:00:47.120> you're<00:00:47.240> kind

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
as efficiently as you can be you're kind

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.690 
as efficiently as you can be you're kind
of<00:00:47.600> probably<00:00:48.020> over<00:00:48.290> striding<00:00:48.740> a<00:00:48.830> little<00:00:49.100> kind

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
of probably over striding a little kind

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.790 
of probably over striding a little kind
of<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.910> heel<00:00:50.210> strike<00:00:50.630> or<00:00:50.930> out<00:00:51.290> in<00:00:51.410> front<00:00:51.470> of<00:00:51.680> your

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
of a heel strike or out in front of your

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.830 
of a heel strike or out in front of your
body<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.250> that's<00:00:53.150> kind<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.420> creating<00:00:53.720> this

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
body and that's kind of creating this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.170 
body and that's kind of creating this
braking<00:00:54.260> force<00:00:54.560> pushing<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.070> back<00:00:55.370> whereas

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
braking force pushing you back whereas

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.300 
braking force pushing you back whereas
you<00:00:56.270> want<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.510> go<00:00:56.630> forward<00:00:56.990> so<00:00:57.350> it's

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
you want to go forward so it's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.890 
you want to go forward so it's
overloading<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.790> hamstring<00:00:59.270> muscles<00:00:59.660> maybe

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
overloading the hamstring muscles maybe

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.380 
overloading the hamstring muscles maybe
your<00:01:00.080> quadriceps<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.790> solution<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:02.300> that

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
your quadriceps and the solution to that

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.710 
your quadriceps and the solution to that
really<00:01:02.720> is<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.620> try<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.830> run<00:01:04.070> tall<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:05.540> lean

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
really is to try to run tall to lean

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.630 
really is to try to run tall to lean
forward<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.590> run<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.920> sled<00:01:07.130> forward<00:01:07.369> lane

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
forward to run to the sled forward lane

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.179 
forward to run to the sled forward lane
but<00:01:08.119> have<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:08.479> lean<00:01:08.689> start<00:01:09.200> at<00:01:09.500> your<00:01:09.740> ankles

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
but have that lean start at your ankles

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.340 
but have that lean start at your ankles
rather<00:01:10.490> than<00:01:10.820> your<00:01:11.390> hips<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:11.960> instead<00:01:12.290> of

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
rather than your hips so instead of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.530 
rather than your hips so instead of
running<00:01:12.650> leaning<00:01:13.490> forward<00:01:13.790> from<00:01:13.970> your<00:01:14.000> your

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
running leaning forward from your your

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.630 
running leaning forward from your your
chest<00:01:14.900> you're<00:01:15.170> running<00:01:15.439> leaning<00:01:16.400> forward

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
chest you're running leaning forward

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.960 
chest you're running leaning forward
from<00:01:16.790> your<00:01:16.820> ankle<00:01:17.300> so<00:01:21.310> we<00:01:22.310> started<00:01:22.700> talking

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
from your ankle so we started talking

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.270 
from your ankle so we started talking
about<00:01:23.090> stride<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.530> was<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.890> had<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.130> good

about stride and I was I had a good
stride<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.640> was<00:01:26.060> running<00:01:26.300> while<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.480> was<00:01:26.900> running

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
stride I was running while I was running

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.200 
stride I was running while I was running
on<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.260> balls<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.590> my<00:01:27.710> feet<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.340> forefoot

drills I do sometimes just in the middle
of<00:02:04.460> my<00:02:04.610> run<00:02:04.790> if<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.060> feel<00:02:05.270> like<00:02:05.510> I'm<00:02:05.780> still<00:02:06.320> over

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
of my run if I feel like I'm still over

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.190 
of my run if I feel like I'm still over
striding<00:02:07.400> it's<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.420> do<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.569> couple<00:02:08.959> bundt

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
striding it's just I do a couple bundt

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.979 
striding it's just I do a couple bundt
cakes<00:02:09.879> so<00:02:10.879> all<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.629> do<00:02:13.360> keep<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.629> like<00:02:14.720> that

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
cakes so all you do keep going like that

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.839 
cakes so all you do keep going like that
and<00:02:15.349> normally<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:15.830> throw<00:02:16.159> that<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.610> run

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
and normally I just throw that in my run

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.940 
and normally I just throw that in my run
and<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.269> just<00:02:17.480> automatically<00:02:18.409> reminds<00:02:18.860> my

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
and it just automatically reminds my

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.150 
and it just automatically reminds my
legs<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.400> where<00:02:19.549> my<00:02:19.700> foot<00:02:19.939> should<00:02:20.090> be<00:02:20.209> landing

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
legs of where my foot should be landing

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.040 
legs of where my foot should be landing
so<00:02:22.160> another<00:02:22.490> suggestion<00:02:22.970> for<00:02:23.240> drills<00:02:23.569> she's

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
so another suggestion for drills she's

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.259 
so another suggestion for drills she's
skipping

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.820 

you<00:02:28.269> can<00:02:28.420> see<00:02:28.660> how<00:02:28.930> he's<00:02:29.140> landing<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:29.709> his

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
you can see how he's landing with his

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.110 
you can see how he's landing with his
feet<00:02:30.040> beneath<00:02:30.190> them<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.760> he<00:02:30.819> is<00:02:30.849> still

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
feet beneath them and he is still

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.460 
feet beneath them and he is still
landing<00:02:31.510> pretty<00:02:31.750> much<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.080> ball<00:02:32.230> just

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
landing pretty much on the ball just

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.820 
landing pretty much on the ball just
feet<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.510> skipping<00:02:37.900> also<00:02:38.440> kind<00:02:38.739> of

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
feet so skipping also kind of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.920 
feet so skipping also kind of
exaggerated<00:02:39.670> s'<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.030> proper<00:02:40.360> mechanics<00:02:40.840> you

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
exaggerated s' the proper mechanics you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.559 
exaggerated s' the proper mechanics you
need<00:02:41.140> with<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> high<00:02:42.160> knee<00:02:42.220> lift<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.940> kind<00:02:43.510> of

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
need with a high knee lift and kind of

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.970 
need with a high knee lift and kind of
driving<00:02:43.870> your<00:02:44.140> foot<00:02:44.410> down<00:02:44.739> into<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.910> ground

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
driving your foot down into the ground

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.170 
driving your foot down into the ground
the<00:02:47.980> way<00:02:48.129> you<00:02:48.190> want<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.519> do<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.819> develop

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the way you want to do it to develop

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.270 
the way you want to do it to develop
more<00:02:49.330> power<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:50.049> your<00:02:50.290> stride<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.099> make

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
more power in your stride and to make

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.520 
more power in your stride and to make
sure<00:02:51.489> you're<00:02:51.730> running<00:02:52.299> tall<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.019> getting

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
sure you're running tall and getting

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.860 
sure you're running tall and getting
that<00:02:53.650> explosive<00:02:54.069> lift<00:02:54.580> using<00:02:55.540> your<00:02:55.660> calf

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
that explosive lift using your calf

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.190 
that explosive lift using your calf
muscles<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:57.250> leaning<00:02:58.209> forward<00:02:58.239> at<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
muscles and leaning forward at the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.160 
muscles and leaning forward at the
proper<00:02:59.530> angle<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:04.000> another<00:03:04.269> thing<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:05.140> think

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
proper angle so another thing to think

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.630 
proper angle so another thing to think
about<00:03:05.560> when<00:03:05.709> you're<00:03:05.829> running<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.280> your<00:03:06.459> arm

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
about when you're running is your arm

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.670 
about when you're running is your arm
swing<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.870> lot<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.049> people<00:03:08.349> do<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
swing and a lot of people do this a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.350 
swing and a lot of people do this a
little<00:03:08.769> bit<00:03:09.010> differently<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.640> does<00:03:09.790> depend<00:03:10.180> on

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
little bit differently it does depend on

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.539 
little bit differently it does depend on
the<00:03:11.260> length<00:03:11.410> of<00:03:11.590> your<00:03:11.709> arms<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.220> how<00:03:12.400> your

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
the length of your arms and how your

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.240 
the length of your arms and how your
body<00:03:12.819> weights<00:03:13.120> distributed<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:14.250> generally

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
body weights distributed but generally

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.220 
body weights distributed but generally
in<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.849> latter<00:03:16.030> stages<00:03:16.329> of<00:03:16.480> race<00:03:16.870> or<00:03:17.140> if

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
in the latter stages of race or if

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.259 
in the latter stages of race or if
you're<00:03:17.379> getting<00:03:17.500> tired<00:03:17.910> people<00:03:18.910> tend<00:03:19.239> to

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
you're getting tired people tend to

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.850 
you're getting tired people tend to
tense<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.750> they<00:03:20.110> got<00:03:20.260> too<00:03:20.470> much<00:03:20.590> shoulder

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
tense up they got too much shoulder

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.160 
tense up they got too much shoulder
tension<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.670> that's<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:22.599> wasted<00:03:23.019> energy

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
tension and that's just wasted energy

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.220 
tension and that's just wasted energy
maybe<00:03:23.950> your<00:03:24.129> biceps<00:03:24.549> are<00:03:24.730> also<00:03:24.849> flexing<00:03:25.450> and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
maybe your biceps are also flexing and

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.500 
maybe your biceps are also flexing and
you<00:03:26.319> start<00:03:26.590> thrashing<00:03:26.860> across<00:03:27.430> your<00:03:27.640> body<00:03:27.790> and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
you start thrashing across your body and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.849 
you start thrashing across your body and
really<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:28.989> want<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.230> keep<00:03:29.410> your<00:03:29.590> arms

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
really you just want to keep your arms

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.039 
really you just want to keep your arms
nice<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.160> relaxed<00:03:30.850> kind<00:03:31.389> of<00:03:31.510> naturally

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
swinging quickly means their stride rate

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.640 
swinging quickly means their stride rate
is<00:03:41.980> also<00:03:42.340> turning<00:03:42.639> over<00:03:42.880> nice<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.810> quick<00:03:44.049> nice

you<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.120> do<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.419> improve<00:03:58.510> your<00:03:58.810> strides<00:03:59.109> just

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
you can do to improve your strides just
