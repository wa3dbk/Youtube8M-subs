now I've got 100 more clause in 197 mole

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
now I've got 100 more clause in 197 mole
skins<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.730> gonna<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.840> ahead

go ahead and exchange the more claws and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.310 
go ahead and exchange the more claws and
mole<00:00:43.739> skins<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.850> herbs<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> seeds<00:00:45.719> basically

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
mole skins for herbs and seeds basically

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.560 
mole skins for herbs and seeds basically
you<00:00:46.530> gets<00:00:46.770> bird<00:00:47.129> nests<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.059> exchange<00:00:48.270> them

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you gets bird nests if you exchange them

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
you gets bird nests if you exchange them
to<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> gardener<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.399> fally<00:00:50.640> park<00:00:50.940> or

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to the gardener in fally park or

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.540 
to the gardener in fally park or
something<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.280> what<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> other

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
something like that so what the other

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.970 
something like that so what the other
loot<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.120> didn't<00:00:54.750> pick<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.170> every<00:00:55.530> single<00:00:55.649> drop

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
loot I didn't pick up every single drop

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.860 
loot I didn't pick up every single drop
since<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.460> has<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.180> pretty<00:00:57.270> crappy<00:00:57.570> jobs

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
since it has some pretty crappy jobs

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.049 
since it has some pretty crappy jobs
like<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.320> guess<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.770> myth<00:00:59.070> skins<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.579> skins<00:00:59.910> or

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
like I guess like myth skins or skins or

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.459 
like I guess like myth skins or skins or
something<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.480> drops<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
something like that just drops out you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.810 
something like that just drops out you
don't<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.770> necessarily<00:01:02.039> always<00:01:02.489> pick<00:01:02.730> up

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
don't really necessarily always pick up

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.250 
don't really necessarily always pick up
I<00:01:02.969> pick<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.300> some<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> beginning<00:01:04.229> like

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I pick it up some of the beginning like

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
I pick it up some of the beginning like
the<00:01:04.470> end<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> strengths<00:01:05.100> since<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.729> thought

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the end of the strengths since I thought

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.100 
the end of the strengths since I thought
they<00:01:05.970> were<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> add<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> end

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
they were going to add up but at the end

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.030 
they were going to add up but at the end
of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> day<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> didn't<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.950> much

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of the day I didn't have that much

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
of the day I didn't have that much
inventory<00:01:08.250> space<00:01:08.670> since<00:01:09.479> killing<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> mole

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
inventory space since killing the mole

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.230 
inventory space since killing the mole
is<00:01:10.380> very<00:01:10.650> quick<00:01:10.890> especially<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.210> have

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
is very quick especially if you have

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.090 
is very quick especially if you have
with<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.680> doing<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.070> was

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
with what with what I was doing I was

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.640 
with what with what I was doing I was
doing<00:01:14.240> one<00:01:15.240> HP<00:01:15.450> da<00:01:15.720> qing<00:01:15.840> i<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.530> my

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
doing one HP da qing i would have my

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.859 
doing one HP da qing i would have my
full<00:01:16.830> th<00:01:17.520> set<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.330> went<00:01:18.810> ahead

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
full th set and then I just went ahead

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.800 
full th set and then I just went ahead
and<00:01:19.140> killed<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.009> max<00:01:20.280> gear<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> low<00:01:21.450> HP

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and killed it with max gear and low HP

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.960 
and killed it with max gear and low HP
DHI<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.409> sitting<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.650> constant<00:01:23.280> 70s<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
DHI was sitting like constant 70s on it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.789 
DHI was sitting like constant 70s on it
it's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.930> quick<00:01:25.170> especially<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
it's a very quick especially with the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.050 
it's a very quick especially with the
mole<00:01:25.920> locator<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.549> always<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.909> where

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
mole locator when you always know where

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870

like that and people were also saying

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.340 
like that and people were also saying
that<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.150> actually<00:02:31.330> poison<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.050> giant

that you can actually poison the giant

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.930 
that you can actually poison the giant
mole<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:32.650> that's<00:02:32.860> not<00:02:32.980> true<00:02:33.160> because<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.489> did

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
mole but that's not true because it did

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.000 
mole but that's not true because it did
actually<00:02:34.060> happen<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.470> was<00:02:35.920> actually

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
actually happen but I was actually

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460 
actually happen but I was actually
surprised<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:37.150> guess<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.690> lack<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.959> good

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
surprised that I guess the lack of good

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.050 
surprised that I guess the lack of good
seeds<00:02:38.830> i<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.069> getting<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.430> bird<00:02:39.640> nests<00:02:39.970> I

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
seeds i was getting for bird nests I

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.670 
seeds i was getting for bird nests I
thought<00:02:40.270> it'd<00:02:40.360> be<00:02:40.390> getting<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.690> lot<00:02:40.870> more<00:02:40.900> has

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
thought it'd be getting a lot more has

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.320 
thought it'd be getting a lot more has
been<00:02:41.860> specific<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.580> higher<00:02:42.760> level<00:02:43.060> ones<00:02:43.209> i

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
been specific the higher level ones i

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.150 
been specific the higher level ones i
guess<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.750> magic<00:02:44.350> she'd<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.920> seed

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
guess like the magic she'd and you seed

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.060 
guess like the magic she'd and you seed
but<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.690> far<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.350> guys<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.590> see<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.769> screen<00:02:47.860> i

only have one you seed and I only kept a
couple<00:02:50.050> seats<00:02:50.410> since<00:02:50.620> these<00:02:50.800> are<00:02:50.860> very<00:02:51.250> cheap

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
couple seats since these are very cheap

on this game there's only I guess out of
the<00:02:54.430> dozens<00:02:54.790> seat<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.180> game<00:02:55.360> there's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the dozens seat on this game there's

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.090 
the dozens seat on this game there's
less<00:02:55.720> than<00:02:55.750> six<00:02:56.230> or<00:02:56.350> seven<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.769> actually

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
less than six or seven that actually

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.620 
less than six or seven that actually
worth<00:02:57.250> something<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.239> don't<00:02:58.300> know<00:02:58.480> why<00:02:58.600> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
worth something and I don't know why I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.390 
worth something and I don't know why I
kept<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.080> sweet<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.500> strawberry<00:03:00.069> seeds<00:03:00.280> i

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
kept the sweet the strawberry seeds i

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
kept the sweet the strawberry seeds i
thought<00:03:00.550> they're<00:03:00.700> worth<00:03:00.880> something<00:03:01.000> for<00:03:01.300> some

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
thought they're worth something for some

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.120 
thought they're worth something for some
reason<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:01.840> they're<00:03:01.959> really<00:03:02.080> warrants<00:03:02.470> but

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
reason but they're really warrants but

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.610 
reason but they're really warrants but
some<00:03:03.400> opening<00:03:04.120> these<00:03:04.239> i<00:03:04.480> actually<00:03:05.140> only<00:03:05.380> got

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
some opening these i actually only got

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.500 
some opening these i actually only got
one<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.100> seed<00:03:06.340> which<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.030> guys<00:03:07.180> can<00:03:07.300> see<00:03:07.420> on

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
one you seed which you guys can see on

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.030 
one you seed which you guys can see on
screen<00:03:07.600> right<00:03:07.810> now<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.470> that's<00:03:08.800> pretty<00:03:08.920> much

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
screen right now so that's pretty much

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.130 
screen right now so that's pretty much
all<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.250> got<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.700> got<00:03:09.850> some<00:03:10.000> renar<00:03:10.239> seeds<00:03:10.480> but

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
all I got and I got some renar seeds but

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.809 
all I got and I got some renar seeds but
that's<00:03:11.350> all<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.800> guess<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.250> main<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.430> get<00:03:12.670> one

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
that's all I guess the main I get one

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.670 
that's all I guess the main I get one
magic<00:03:13.120> seed<00:03:13.300> from<00:03:13.480> over<00:03:13.690> three<00:03:13.900> under<00:03:14.080> almost

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
magic seed from over three under almost

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.160 
magic seed from over three under almost
300<00:03:15.069> magic<00:03:15.340> or<00:03:15.519> bird<00:03:15.760> nests<00:03:16.690> which<00:03:16.870> sort<00:03:17.079> of

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
300 magic or bird nests which sort of

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.140 
300 magic or bird nests which sort of
sucks<00:03:17.440> but<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.829> then<00:03:18.370> crushed<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.790> bird<00:03:18.940> nest

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
sucks but I then crushed the bird nest

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.759 
sucks but I then crushed the bird nest
and<00:03:19.420> actually<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.049> main<00:03:20.140> money<00:03:20.380> from<00:03:20.620> this

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
and actually the main money from this

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.620 
and actually the main money from this
comes<00:03:21.070> from<00:03:21.190> crushing<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.760> bird<00:03:21.910> nest<00:03:22.150> that's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
comes from crushing the bird nest that's

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.449 
comes from crushing the bird nest that's
actually<00:03:22.780> worth<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.200> most<00:03:23.350> since<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.220> crush

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
actually worth the most since the crush

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.770 
actually worth the most since the crush
bird<00:03:24.700> nests<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:25.060> what<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.299> use<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.480> make<00:03:25.750> a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
bird nests is what you use to make a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.440 
bird nests is what you use to make a
saradomin<00:03:26.170> brew<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.070> that's<00:03:28.060> where<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.269> main

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
saradomin brew so that's where the main

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.699 
saradomin brew so that's where the main
money<00:03:28.630> come<00:03:28.840> from<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.140> comes<00:03:29.470> from<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
money come from that comes from the

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.350 
money come from that comes from the
giant<00:03:29.980> mole<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.250> just<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.640> guess<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.239> bird

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
giant mole is just I guess the bird

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.120 
giant mole is just I guess the bird
nests<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.959> can<00:03:32.110> also<00:03:32.230> sell<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> more<00:03:32.860> claws

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
nests you can also sell the more claws

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.880 
nests you can also sell the more claws
anmol<00:03:33.519> skins<00:03:33.820> as<00:03:34.140> they<00:03:35.140> are<00:03:35.320> like<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.709> know<00:03:35.799> if

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
anmol skins as they are like you know if

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.979 
anmol skins as they are like you know if
that<00:03:36.040> shade<00:03:36.430> trade<00:03:36.760> them<00:03:36.910> in<00:03:37.000> but<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.660> decided

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
that shade trade them in but I decided

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.870 
that shade trade them in but I decided
to<00:03:38.410> exchange<00:03:38.590> them<00:03:38.860> since<00:03:39.100> you'd<00:03:39.220> exchange

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
to exchange them since you'd exchange

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.030 
to exchange them since you'd exchange
them<00:03:40.060> since<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.390> do<00:03:40.540> make<00:03:40.690> more<00:03:40.900> money<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.739> for

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
them since you do make more money so for

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.120 
them since you do make more money so for
100<00:03:42.370> giant<00:03:42.640> mole<00:03:42.760> kills<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.269> managed<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.720> make

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
100 giant mole kills I managed to make

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.270 
100 giant mole kills I managed to make
1.4<00:03:45.130> mil<00:03:45.640> or<00:03:45.910> almost<00:03:46.209> 1.5<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.709> don't<00:03:48.190> really

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
1.4 mil or almost 1.5 and I don't really

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.500 
1.4 mil or almost 1.5 and I don't really
think<00:03:48.400> it's<00:03:48.609> worth<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.060> do<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.269> for<00:03:49.359> money

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
think it's worth it to do it for money

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.970 
think it's worth it to do it for money
if<00:03:49.810> you're<00:03:49.930> doing<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.200> for<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.380> pet<00:03:50.560> then<00:03:50.829> it's

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
if you're doing it for the pet then it's

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.340 
if you're doing it for the pet then it's
I<00:03:51.220> guess<00:03:51.549> worth<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.940> but<00:03:52.239> money<00:03:52.810> wise<00:03:53.049> i<00:03:53.079> was

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
I guess worth it but money wise i was

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.259 
I guess worth it but money wise i was
doing<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.590> for<00:03:53.829> probably<00:03:54.160> five<00:03:54.489> five<00:03:55.239> six

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
doing this for probably five five six

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.810 
doing this for probably five five six
hours<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.930> i<00:03:55.959> mentioned<00:03:56.290> me<00:03:56.350> like<00:03:56.859> only<00:03:57.220> 1.5

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
hours and i mentioned me like only 1.5

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.900 
hours and i mentioned me like only 1.5
mil<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:58.570> money-wise<00:03:59.560> from<00:04:00.190> something<00:04:00.730> max

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
mil so money-wise from something max

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.190 
mil so money-wise from something max
like<00:04:01.120> me<00:04:01.299> it's<00:04:01.480> definitely<00:04:01.810> not<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.019> best

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
like me it's definitely not the best

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.140 
like me it's definitely not the best
money<00:04:02.350> in<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.530> game<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:02.950> guess<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.519> sort<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.000> fun

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
money in the game I guess so sort of fun

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.539 
money in the game I guess so sort of fun
to<00:04:04.239> do<00:04:04.359> but<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:05.320> know<00:04:05.440> not<00:04:05.920> my<00:04:06.070> forte<00:04:06.310> I
