compartment<00:04:00.260> in<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.769> middle<00:04:01.040> at<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.670> top<00:04:01.910> you

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
compartment in the middle at the top you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.240 
compartment in the middle at the top you
have<00:04:02.390> your<00:04:02.750> micro<00:04:03.200> SD<00:04:03.440> card<00:04:03.680> slot<00:04:03.739> which<00:04:04.070> can

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
have your micro SD card slot which can

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.699 
have your micro SD card slot which can

accept up to 32 gigs of storage and it

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.470 
accept up to 32 gigs of storage and it
has<00:04:06.860> moving<00:04:07.130> parts<00:04:07.280> which<00:04:07.730> I'd<00:04:07.850> really<00:04:08.090> don't

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
has moving parts which I'd really don't

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.860 
has moving parts which I'd really don't
like<00:04:09.310> well<00:04:10.310> now<00:04:10.430> let's<00:04:10.730> put<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.180> 1700<00:04:11.810> MHz

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
like well now let's put the 1700 MHz

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.940 
like well now let's put the 1700 MHz
otteri<00:04:12.440> in<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:14.170> then<00:04:15.170> we<00:04:15.320> will<00:04:15.350> power<00:04:15.680> on<00:04:15.860> the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
otteri in and then we will power on the

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.680 
otteri in and then we will power on the
phone<00:04:16.160> for<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.580> very<00:04:16.790> first<00:04:17.030> time

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.930 

that's<00:04:20.690> back<00:04:21.080> cover<00:04:21.440> closed<00:04:21.770> let's<00:04:22.640> close<00:04:22.910> up

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
that's back cover closed let's close up

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.080 
that's back cover closed let's close up
all<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.300> locks<00:04:23.660> properly<00:04:27.370> there's<00:04:28.370> almost<00:04:28.610> no

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
all the locks properly there's almost no

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.970 
all the locks properly there's almost no
flex<00:04:29.450> in<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.750> device<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.320> back<00:04:30.500> cover<00:04:30.770> seems

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
flex in the device the back cover seems

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.190 
flex in the device the back cover seems
really<00:04:31.310> solid<00:04:31.640> as<00:04:31.730> well<00:04:31.910> it's<00:04:32.570> good<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:33.020> hold

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
really solid as well it's good to hold

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.100 
really solid as well it's good to hold
in<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.620> hand<00:04:33.800> -<00:04:34.130> it's<00:04:34.970> definitely<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.840> bit

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
in the hand - it's definitely a bit

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.530 
in the hand - it's definitely a bit
thicker<00:04:36.440> than<00:04:36.740> your<00:04:37.610> average<00:04:37.910> four<00:04:38.360> inch

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
thicker than your average four inch

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.200 
thicker than your average four inch
device<00:04:39.340> but<00:04:40.340> still<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.760> doesn't<00:04:40.940> weigh<00:04:41.180> that

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
device but still it doesn't weigh that

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.000 
device but still it doesn't weigh that
much

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
much

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.290 
much
now<00:04:43.010> that's<00:04:43.220> far<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.670> phone<00:04:43.820> for<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.150> very

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
now that's far on the phone for the very

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.570 
now that's far on the phone for the very
first<00:04:44.510> time<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:45.080> will<00:04:45.800> look<00:04:45.890> at<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.400> boot

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
first time I will look at the boot

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.720 
first time I will look at the boot
animation<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.650> have<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.830> four<00:04:49.040> inch<00:04:49.190> WVGA

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
animation so you have a four inch WVGA

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.460 
animation so you have a four inch WVGA
display<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:50.690> have<00:04:50.720> three<00:04:50.990> capacitive

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
display you have three capacitive

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.110 
display you have three capacitive
buttons<00:04:51.770> at<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:51.920> bottom<00:04:52.280> which<00:04:52.490> don't<00:04:52.850> light

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
buttons at the bottom which don't light

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.320 
buttons at the bottom which don't light
up<00:04:53.150> I<00:04:53.450> presume<00:04:53.890> at<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.070> top<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.490> have<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:56.030> VGA

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
up I presume at the top you have the VGA

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.300 
up I presume at the top you have the VGA
front-facing<00:04:56.630> camera<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.290> some<00:04:57.620> sensors<00:04:58.040> and

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
front-facing camera and some sensors and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.490 
front-facing camera and some sensors and
the<00:04:58.370> primary<00:04:58.730> earpiece<00:04:59.140> let<00:05:00.140> me<00:05:00.260> take<00:05:00.470> that

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
the primary earpiece let me take that

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.170 
the primary earpiece let me take that
plastic<00:05:01.160> off<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.490> you<00:05:01.670> can<00:05:01.820> see<00:05:02.030> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
plastic off so that you can see the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.880 
plastic off so that you can see the
display<00:05:02.420> better<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:06.020> it's<00:05:06.140> still<00:05:06.380> booting<00:05:06.770> up

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
display better so it's still booting up

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.960 
display better so it's still booting up
you<00:05:07.070> can<00:05:07.220> see<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> lava<00:05:07.730> or<00:05:07.970> logo<00:05:08.270> right<00:05:08.450> there

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
you can see the lava or logo right there

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.280 
you can see the lava or logo right there
so<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.090> boot<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.390> not<00:05:11.420> completed<00:05:11.900> I<00:05:12.020> will<00:05:12.140> come

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
so the boot is not completed I will come

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.650 
so the boot is not completed I will come
back<00:05:12.440> after<00:05:12.590> configuring<00:05:13.240> so<00:05:14.240> folks<00:05:14.450> you<00:05:14.600> have

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
back after configuring so folks you have

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.330 
back after configuring so folks you have
back<00:05:14.930> now<00:05:15.140> we<00:05:15.200> are<00:05:15.380> at<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.740> home<00:05:15.950> screen<00:05:16.100> as

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
back now we are at the home screen as

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.800 
back now we are at the home screen as
you<00:05:16.400> can<00:05:16.550> see<00:05:16.730> let<00:05:16.940> me<00:05:16.970> reduce<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.600> brightness

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
you can see let me reduce the brightness

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.370 
you can see let me reduce the brightness
so<00:05:18.260> that<00:05:18.410> you<00:05:18.500> can<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.920> display<00:05:19.130> better

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
so that you can see the display better

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.560 
so that you can see the display better
that<00:05:21.380> seems<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:22.040> about<00:05:22.130> right<00:05:22.580> so<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:23.450> can

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
that seems just about right so you can

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.210 
that seems just about right so you can
see<00:05:23.720> it's<00:05:23.840> a<00:05:23.960> very<00:05:23.990> stock<00:05:24.560> looking<00:05:24.920> interface

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220
