okay<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:02.149> part<00:00:03.149> three<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.629> my

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
okay this is part three of my

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.620 
okay this is part three of my
supercomputer<00:00:07.379> cluster<00:00:07.910> have<00:00:08.910> been<00:00:09.090> building

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
supercomputer cluster have been building

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.990 
supercomputer cluster have been building
has<00:00:09.929> gone<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.380> three<00:00:10.710> nodes<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.429> then<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
has gone to three nodes and then the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.270 
has gone to three nodes and then the
server<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.139> white<00:00:13.349> tower<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.009> right

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
server is the white tower on the right

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.870 
server is the white tower on the right
and<00:00:14.910> that's<00:00:15.690> my<00:00:15.990> computer<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.830> left<00:00:16.880> doing

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and that's my computer on the left doing

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.519 
and that's my computer on the left doing
absolutely<00:00:18.109> squat<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:20.539> only<00:00:21.539> only<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:23.210> node

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
absolutely squat and only only have node

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.000 
absolutely squat and only only have node
three<00:00:25.529> which<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.660> this<00:00:27.660> one's<00:00:27.990> dragged<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
three which is this one's dragged to the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.950 
three which is this one's dragged to the
bottom<00:00:29.039> they're<00:00:31.279> running<00:00:32.279> because<00:00:33.270> there<00:00:33.780> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
bottom they're running because there is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.940 
bottom they're running because there is
not<00:00:34.430> or<00:00:35.430> there's<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:35.940> much<00:00:36.380> into<00:00:37.380> traffic

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
not or there's not much into traffic

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.660 
not or there's not much into traffic
as<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.140> gigabit<00:00:40.140> 24<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.129> 48

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
as you can see the gigabit 24 the 48

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.830 
as you can see the gigabit 24 the 48
port<00:00:41.969> limits<00:00:42.390> which<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.809> doing<00:00:43.079> jack<00:00:44.840> but

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
port limits which is doing jack but

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.930 
port limits which is doing jack but
as<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.350> i<00:00:46.770> modified<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.879> took

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
as you can see i modified it I took

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.330 
as you can see i modified it I took
everything<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> those<00:00:49.110> cases<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.129> I've

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
everything out of those cases and I've

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.610 
everything out of those cases and I've
used<00:00:51.440> kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.920> wireframe<00:00:53.190> rack<00:00:54.620> which

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
used kind of like a wireframe rack which

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
used kind of like a wireframe rack which
I<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.129> used<00:00:56.460> cable<00:00:56.940> toss<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> tell<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I then used cable toss to tell the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.020 
I then used cable toss to tell the
motherboards<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.510> would<00:01:00.899> look

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
motherboards on so that it would look

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:11.780 
motherboards on so that it would look
pretty<00:01:03.030> decent<00:01:07.369> ok<00:01:09.770> as<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.580> much

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
pretty decent ok as you can see not much

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.539 
pretty decent ok as you can see not much
activity<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.140> pretty<00:01:14.010> cool<00:01:14.340> day<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
activity that's a pretty cool day to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.469 
activity that's a pretty cool day to
record<00:01:15.090> their<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.409> red<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:19.130> that's<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
record their in red and that's in a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.560 
record their in red and that's in a
dark<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.700> I'll<00:01:23.700> copy<00:01:23.939> anything<00:01:24.330> my

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
dark and then I'll copy anything my

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.319 
dark and then I'll copy anything my
screen<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.790> put<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:31.400> better<00:01:32.400> quality<00:01:32.939> video

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
screen and put a better quality video

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.690 
screen and put a better quality video
and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> better<00:01:34.500> camera<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.549> can

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and I get a better camera but as you can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
and I get a better camera but as you can
see<00:01:36.560> I'm<00:01:37.560> using<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:38.009> third<00:01:38.329> I'm<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.689> once<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
see I'm using my third I'm gonna once I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.350 
see I'm using my third I'm gonna once I
get<00:01:40.590> everything<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.610> running<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:42.150> gonna

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
get everything up and running I'm gonna

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.830 
get everything up and running I'm gonna
put<00:01:42.659> full<00:01:43.079> instructions<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.040> how<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.840> perfect

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
put full instructions on how to perfect

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
put full instructions on how to perfect
your<00:01:46.560> cluster<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.430> isn't<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.060> any

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
your cluster because it isn't really any
