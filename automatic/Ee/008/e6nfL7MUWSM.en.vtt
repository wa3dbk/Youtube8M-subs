the new uno and uno receiver so

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.329 
the new uno and uno receiver so
immersion<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.449> are<00:00:18.599> the<00:00:18.720> v4<00:00:19.289> now<00:00:19.529> everyone

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:20.339 
immersion these are the v4 now everyone

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.980 
immersion these are the v4 now everyone
knows<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.669> immersion<00:00:20.880> idea<00:00:21.419> has<00:00:21.570> always<00:00:21.660> been

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
knows the immersion idea has always been

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.749 
knows the immersion idea has always been
the<00:00:22.109> best<00:00:22.259> it<00:00:22.499> uses<00:00:22.800> air<00:00:22.980> wave<00:00:23.160> modules<00:00:23.609> which

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
the best it uses air wave modules which

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.329 
the best it uses air wave modules which
are<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.480> high<00:00:24.720> sensitivity<00:00:25.410> receivers

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
are really high sensitivity receivers

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.069 
are really high sensitivity receivers
and<00:00:26.519> has<00:00:26.880> always<00:00:27.269> had<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.929> best

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
and has always had the the best

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.989 
and has always had the the best
reception<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.249> price<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.669> them<00:00:29.759> has

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
reception but the price on them has

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.880 
reception but the price on them has
always<00:00:30.329> been<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.659> little<00:00:30.869> higher<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.409> with

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
always been a little higher and with

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
always been a little higher and with
more<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.850> more<00:00:32.880> receivers<00:00:33.630> coming<00:00:33.930> onto<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
more and more receivers coming onto the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
more and more receivers coming onto the
market<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:34.800> 32<00:00:35.340> channel<00:00:35.700> immersion

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
market that are now 32 channel immersion

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.520 
market that are now 32 channel immersion
was<00:00:36.510> always<00:00:36.810> stuck<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.050> those<00:00:37.320> eight

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
was always stuck with those eight

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
was always stuck with those eight
channels<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.040> those<00:00:38.190> were<00:00:38.340> air<00:00:38.520> wave<00:00:38.700> bands<00:00:39.150> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
channels on those were air wave bands so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
channels on those were air wave bands so
the<00:00:39.900> new<00:00:40.020> ones<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> v4<00:00:40.830> is<00:00:40.950> they're<00:00:41.100> still

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the new ones the v4 is they're still

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.980 
the new ones the v4 is they're still
using<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> air<00:00:41.880> wave<00:00:42.060> chips<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.600> next<00:00:42.870> wave

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
using the air wave chips and next wave

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.800 
using the air wave chips and next wave
technology<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:44.340> offer<00:00:44.610> full<00:00:45.270> 32

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
technology but they now offer full 32

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.510 
technology but they now offer full 32
Channel<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.380> they're<00:00:46.800> definitely<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
Channel and they're definitely up the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
Channel and they're definitely up the
sensitivity<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.480> these<00:00:48.630> too<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:48.900> of<00:00:49.200> course

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
sensitivity on these too so of course

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.580 
sensitivity on these too so of course
we've<00:00:49.530> got<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.860> diversity<00:00:50.550> dunno<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:52.080> in<00:00:52.260> has

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
we've got the diversity dunno to in has

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.800 
we've got the diversity dunno to in has
the<00:00:52.740> LED<00:00:52.890> indicator<00:00:53.490> for<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.090> diversity<00:00:54.630> to

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
the LED indicator for the diversity to

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.270 
the LED indicator for the diversity to
which<00:00:54.990> antenna<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.740> set<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.190> that's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
which antenna is set up and that's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.620 
which antenna is set up and that's
really<00:00:56.400> nice<00:00:56.790> that<00:00:57.000> allows<00:00:57.240> you<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.450> run<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
really nice that allows you to run a

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.350 
really nice that allows you to run a
circular<00:00:58.080> polarized<00:00:58.700> Omni<00:00:59.700> on<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
circular polarized Omni on this one and

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.940 
circular polarized Omni on this one and
then<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.720> say<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> circular<00:01:01.380> polarized<00:01:01.770> patch

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
then like say a circular polarized patch

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.890 
then like say a circular polarized patch
on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> opposite<00:01:02.700> one<00:01:02.850> point<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> off<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
on the opposite one point it off in the

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.420 
on the opposite one point it off in the
direction<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.500> I'll<00:01:04.589> switch<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.009> between<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
direction and I'll switch in between the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.980 
direction and I'll switch in between the
two<00:01:05.579> if<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:05.969> overhead<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.539> behind<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
two if you go overhead or behind you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
two if you go overhead or behind you
it's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.679> really<00:01:08.009> nice<00:01:08.130> receiver<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.640> actually

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it's a really nice receiver I actually

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.819 
it's a really nice receiver I actually
fly<00:01:09.149> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.359> original<00:01:09.719> v3<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
fly in the original v3 and this is the

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.889 
fly in the original v3 and this is the
v4<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.399> even<00:01:11.759> I'm<00:01:11.880> envious<00:01:12.119> over<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.719> thing

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
v4 so even I'm envious over this thing

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.980 
v4 so even I'm envious over this thing
it's<00:01:13.289> got<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> GS<00:01:13.829> link<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.310> allows<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.789> to

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's got the GS link which allows it to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.450 
it's got the GS link which allows it to
send<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.079> information<00:01:16.619> over<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
send the information over to the the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.279 
send the information over to the the
ground<00:01:17.670> station<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.179> here<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.600> multiple

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
ground station right here for multiple

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.410 
ground station right here for multiple
different<00:01:19.590> things<00:01:19.829> in<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.850> case<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
different things in this case this is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359 
different things in this case this is
going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.719> for<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:21.990> antenna<00:01:22.409> tracker<00:01:22.799> now

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
going to be for the antenna tracker now

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
going to be for the antenna tracker now
it<00:01:23.520> uses<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> two<00:01:24.569> button<00:01:24.780> setup<00:01:25.109> instead<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it uses a two button setup instead of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410 
it uses a two button setup instead of
the<00:01:25.829> original<00:01:25.950> using<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.640> single<00:01:26.969> button<00:01:27.149> setup

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the original using a single button setup

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.789 
the original using a single button setup
just<00:01:27.749> for<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.140> through<00:01:28.350> eight<00:01:28.439> channels

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
just for the one through eight channels

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
just for the one through eight channels
so<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.399> have<00:01:29.609> band<00:01:29.880> 1<00:01:30.149> through<00:01:30.359> 4<00:01:30.569> band<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
so now we have band 1 through 4 band and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.330 
so now we have band 1 through 4 band and
then<00:01:31.139> 1<00:01:31.319> through<00:01:31.530> 8<00:01:31.679> on<00:01:31.889> the<00:01:32.009> channel

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
then 1 through 8 on the channel

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.889 
then 1 through 8 on the channel
selection<00:01:32.700> are<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.389> that<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.749> same

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
selection are in that it's the same

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.599 
selection are in that it's the same
great<00:01:34.170> form<00:01:34.409> factor<00:01:34.770> nice<00:01:34.950> aluminum<00:01:35.189> case

a<00:01:37.289> really<00:01:37.889> nice<00:01:38.009> receiver<00:01:38.429> now<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> uno<00:01:39.600> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a really nice receiver now the uno is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.569 
a really nice receiver now the uno is
basically<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.679> chana<00:01:40.889> the<00:01:41.249> single

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
basically just the chana the single

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
basically just the chana the single
version<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.359> this<00:01:42.479> same<00:01:42.899> thing<00:01:43.109> it's<00:01:43.259> got<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
version of this same thing it's got the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
version of this same thing it's got the
the<00:01:43.859> band<00:01:44.069> and<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> channel<00:01:44.670> selection<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the band and the channel selection and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.449 
the band and the channel selection and
just<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:45.840> single<00:01:46.469> but<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:46.979> big<00:01:47.189> thing<00:01:47.429> that

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
just a single but the big thing that

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.550 
just a single but the big thing that
I've<00:01:47.819> really<00:01:48.119> noticed<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.600> these<00:01:48.749> is<00:01:49.079> you're

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
I've really noticed with these is you're

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080 
I've really noticed with these is you're
getting<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.799> same<00:01:49.979> sensitivity<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:50.999> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
getting the same sensitivity you get in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.599 
getting the same sensitivity you get in
the<00:01:51.179> 32<00:01:51.569> channel<00:01:51.929> but<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.469> huge<00:01:52.920> price<00:01:53.310> drop

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
the 32 channel but a huge price drop

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.059 
the 32 channel but a huge price drop
there's<00:01:53.850> essentially<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.899> lot<00:01:55.560> cheaper<00:01:55.829> now

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
there's essentially a lot cheaper now

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.309 
there's essentially a lot cheaper now
definitely<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> more<00:01:57.119> affordable<00:01:57.389> so

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
definitely a more affordable so

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.510 
definitely a more affordable so
definitely<00:01:58.679> take<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.859> look<00:01:59.039> at<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.249> if<00:01:59.429> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
definitely take a look at these if you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.099 
definitely take a look at these if you
want<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> top<00:01:59.969> quality<00:02:00.209> stuff<00:02:00.420> immersion<00:02:01.049> is

what<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.580> their<00:02:36.050> video

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
what they do is on their video

what they do is on their video
transmitters<00:02:37.590> they<00:02:37.740> have<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> connector<00:02:38.730> right

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
transmitters they have a connector right

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.920 
transmitters they have a connector right
on<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> back<00:02:39.180> they<00:02:39.300> have<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> little<00:02:39.750> white

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
on the back they have the little white

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.330 
on the back they have the little white
one<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.440> can<00:02:40.590> also<00:02:40.710> just<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.220> through

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
one and you can also just do it through

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.150 
one and you can also just do it through
your<00:02:41.460> audio<00:02:41.730> channel<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.570> has<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.900> easy

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
your audio channel but it has the easy

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.530 
your audio channel but it has the easy
OSD<00:02:44.160> telemetry<00:02:44.610> information<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.390> is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
OSD telemetry information that is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.570 
OSD telemetry information that is
processed<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.230> sent<00:02:46.500> via<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.010> video<00:02:47.160> link

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
processed and sent via the video link

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.780 
processed and sent via the video link
over<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.420> audio<00:02:48.810> channel<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.920> sits<00:02:50.370> down<00:02:50.550> like

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
over the audio channel it sits down like

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.310 
over the audio channel it sits down like
through<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.420> don't<00:02:51.630> need<00:02:51.750> any<00:02:51.990> additional

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
through so you don't need any additional

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.250 
through so you don't need any additional
telemetry<00:02:52.980> radios<00:02:53.520> or<00:02:53.790> fancy<00:02:54.210> radios<00:02:54.570> on<00:02:54.960> your

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
telemetry radios or fancy radios on your

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.020 
telemetry radios or fancy radios on your
transmitter<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.040> basically<00:02:56.490> processed

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
transmitter this is basically processed

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.940 
transmitter this is basically processed
to<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.240> same<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.750> would<00:02:57.870> be<00:02:58.020> your<00:02:58.200> fpv<00:02:58.710> gear

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
to the same as it would be your fpv gear

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.040 
to the same as it would be your fpv gear
so<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.730> going<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.240> through<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> audio

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
so it's just going in through the audio

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.630 
so it's just going in through the audio
channel<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.650> goes<00:03:01.980> through<00:03:02.160> your<00:03:02.310> receiver

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
channel and goes through your receiver

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640 
channel and goes through your receiver
and<00:03:02.910> as<00:03:03.390> processed<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:03.990> audio<00:03:04.320> channel

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
and as processed on the audio channel

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.470 
and as processed on the audio channel
comes<00:03:04.800> out<00:03:04.950> through<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.130> GS<00:03:05.520> link<00:03:05.790> single

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
comes out through that GS link single

tilt<00:04:07.320> now<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.830> first<00:04:08.490> thing<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.090> really

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
tilt now the first thing is I really

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.150 
tilt now the first thing is I really
like<00:04:09.960> how<00:04:10.260> they've<00:04:10.410> done<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.830> camera

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
like how they've done this camera

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.410 
like how they've done this camera
they've<00:04:11.310> got<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.550> cable<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:11.970> goes<00:04:12.180> through

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
they've got the cable that goes through

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.300 
they've got the cable that goes through
here<00:04:12.660> process<00:04:13.140> around<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> outside<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
here process around the outside and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.070 
here process around the outside and
comes<00:04:14.520> out<00:04:14.640> through<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.970> back<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.690> when<00:04:15.900> this

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
comes out through the back so when this

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.570 
comes out through the back so when this
moves<00:04:16.350> up<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.650> down<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.950> don't<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:17.190> this

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
moves up and down you don't have this

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.420 
moves up and down you don't have this
video<00:04:17.940> cable<00:04:18.359> binding<00:04:19.260> on<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:20.010> servos

video cable binding on the the servos

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.949 
video cable binding on the the servos
it's<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.940> way<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.270> it's<00:04:21.420> channelled<00:04:21.810> and

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
it's it the way that it's channelled and

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.390 
it's it the way that it's channelled and
wrapped<00:04:22.170> it<00:04:22.350> just<00:04:22.530> comes<00:04:22.710> straight<00:04:23.160> out<00:04:23.220> of

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
wrapped it just comes straight out of

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.770 
wrapped it just comes straight out of
the<00:04:23.460> back<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.120> don't<00:04:24.270> have<00:04:24.360> any<00:04:24.510> binding
