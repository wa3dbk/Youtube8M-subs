which he's not very usually plays

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.889 
which he's not very usually plays
obviously<00:01:13.249> he's<00:01:13.850> got<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> lot<00:01:14.179> hype<00:01:14.479> around<00:01:14.689> him

obviously he's got a lot hype around him
but<00:01:15.109> like<00:01:15.289> he's<00:01:15.649> not<00:01:15.829> got<00:01:16.009> great<00:01:16.219> stats<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:16.670> a

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
but like he's not got great stats for a

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.639 
but like he's not got great stats for a
striker<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.659> you'd<00:01:17.780> have<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.109> come<00:01:18.289> home<00:01:18.409> to

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
striker so you'd have to come home to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.010 
striker so you'd have to come home to
see<00:01:18.859> him<00:01:18.979> anywhere<00:01:19.249> to<00:01:19.609> play<00:01:19.759> him<00:01:20.119> like<00:01:20.149> in<00:01:20.659> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
best position you can play with and he's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.700

think<00:01:25.039> about<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:25.460> when<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.030> mls<00:01:26.420> cup<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.810> out

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
think about this when the mls cup is out

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.989 
think about this when the mls cup is out
near<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.319> end<00:01:27.499> of<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> game<00:01:27.740> as<00:01:28.130> well<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:28.939> you

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
near the end of the game as well so you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:30.399 
near the end of the game as well so you
