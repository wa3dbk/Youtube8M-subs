00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.210
 everyone and welcome to practical good the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.780
 Now I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.959
 a bonsai if you remember those who have 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.179
 seen my other videos I had already done 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.460
 another tutorial but this one is special 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.570
 because a subscriber asked me 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.939
 then the theme is an autumn bonsai 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 The materials he uses are wire and 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.810
 recyclable plastic bottles so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.150
 I invite you to have understood for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.560
 that you see that what I did for 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.410
 can get the following result what 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.920
 first thing you're going to do is you're going to cut 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 the ends of the bottle 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.750
 remember you can recycle what you get 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.090
 from the bottle you can make flowers like this 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.730
 that I invite you to look at my other 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:07.750
 tutorials on flowers and now 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.550
 When you have the cylinder, you go to 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.550
 cut three parts 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.680
 ah 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:25.450
 with acrylic paint you will use the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:29.630
 red and orange yellow color 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:34.120
 then wait for it to dry so that it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.120
 you can give a second layer 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.760
 now with white paper what I am 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.790
 doing is I'll show you how you're going to 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.350
 draw the autumn leaves and you too 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.990
 you can do the same so that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.990
 practice before doing it in your 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
 bottle 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.220
 and now it's going to stay that way, I used another 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.590
 type of bottle but because it is smooth 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.380
 then you wanted to be seen 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.720
 better but I do not recommend it much 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 because the plastic of this other bottle 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.300
 it was more difficult to cut then 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:39.540
 because the plastic was harder with a 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.540
 clothes hook you're going to make little holes 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.579
 ah 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.620
 and with the wire you are going to cut it so that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.170
 you stay equal parts 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.170
 put your leaves 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:12.490
 and you're going to kill him date for this 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.560
 video i use 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.260
 a mostacilla of some bracelets that 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.140
 they ruined me then I did not want to throw 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.070
 and what I did then the court so 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.340
 I have several several of different 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.930
 colors and of different sizes then 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.900
 you can do the same thing you can go 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.269
 keeping the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.379
 the beads of the bracelets or necklaces 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:44.140
 that you do not need anymore remember that always 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:49.049
 you have to recycle so you can 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.049
 get more material for your projects 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.270
 ah 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.980
 this owl that they see on screen 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.860
 I came with some earrings as I was lost 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.280
 the other thing I did nothing else was that you 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.280
 remove 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.180
 the ring 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.830
 when you have all your twigs 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.830
 made 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.330
 You'll be seeing the sizes 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.610

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.100

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.970
 you have to do is invite you to

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.169
