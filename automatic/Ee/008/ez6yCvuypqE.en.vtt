00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.980
 fighters weapons present cybersportsman 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:19.590
 this keyboard mouse and keen hearing and with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.490
 the first two points all over or 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.779
 less clear that 3 will be able to replace here 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.060
 I will introduce this device today 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.980
 you are a real cyber warrior kit 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.440
 workplace in front of a large monitor 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.239
 need to prepare let's start with the first 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 need manipulators 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.950
 Ace of offers gaming peripherals in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 Multiple keyboard design 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.090
 allocates 100 as it is not covered 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.989
 camouflage and just black however on her 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.670
 fighting qualities it does not reflect 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.780
 the keyboard from walked it has cycl keys 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.120
 cherry mx black 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 and unlike cherry mx red also 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 considered gaming keyboards 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 cherry mx black is also perfect 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 for printing this is not a membrane cheap 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.539
 full mechanical do not block a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.970
 i nkr keyboard press at the same time 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.680
 as many keys as you like and everyone will 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 computer processed true 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.209
 connections for this must be ps 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.709
 in half by the way this is not orhei to which type 

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:18.959
 connectivity has many advantages 

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:21.179
 chief of which is complete independence 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.099
 about workload and successful and that does not give 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.640
 reason to worry about possible 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:26.130
 delays 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.470
 notice the headset with split 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.700
 headphone and microphone connection 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.920
 can also be plugged directly into 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 keyboard to this ideal 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.740
 headset entire salon 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 a review that you could see earlier on 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.539
 our channel but to the sounds in return 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.580
 later for now we are talking about the keyboard and 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.739
 so the key i was going is highlighted with 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.630
 using LED backlighting while 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.580
 Russian letters are not written with 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.610
 of the stickers they are engraved on the keys 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.410
 therefore they are also seen in the dark 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.149
 Another thing is that the LED is located 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.330
 right under the Latin letter therefore 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.979
 it is logical that I can see better in the dark 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.899
 present the keyboard and from behave my 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.239
 the dream ever since I first saw 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.729
 apple keyboard with divorced yusb 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:08.910
 ports on the sides but such for bye then 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.430
 just did not make tactile sensations from 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.560
 this keyboard is very nice materials 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.959
 quality mice are also selected 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.620
 here tactile sensations will even 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.380
 more important 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.870
 the mouse has a fairly high resolution 5 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.580
 thousand 200 dpi and 5 modes 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.740
 switching scan frequency and 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.630
 programmable keys are generally quite good 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.540
 mouse besides it can be additionally 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.330
 weight in the kit comes 3 200 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.820
 gram and 15 and gram weights but she 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.280
 very sensitive surface therefore 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.330
 Jesus also offers a special 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.250
 camouflage mat for all to 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.210
 Unfortunately, no, but it turned out to be full 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.180
 set well here we got to the heart 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:55.500
 gaming audio interface set jesus 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.900
 zones are you 7 inside the way and it is to the analyzer 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.880
 and thinker but seriously inside 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.690
 This audio interface is installed top 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.720
 audi process 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.150
 same as in asus essence 3 cost 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.430
 about 90 thousand rubles his review you so 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.290
 could see on our channel plus myself 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.030
 from cirrus spoons with maximum it 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.310
 sampling 192 kilohertz and 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.900
 24 bits wide 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.819
 allows you to refer it to advanced 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.410
 models it turns out that the audio interface 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.990
 and cost only 3,000 rubles 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.000
 installed top components and for 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.040
 this money is better in decision objectively not 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.450
 find and it's all about music 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000
 she sounds all seven really 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.560
 amazing amplifier of this audio 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.230
 cards support headphones with 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.310
 impedance up to 150 m can pick up 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.680
 very decent model but it is far from 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.780
 all multichannel sound support 71 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.760
 together with a special driver allows 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.390
 so immersed in the game that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.340
 realism sometimes even scary but if 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.709
 you have private stereo do not worry 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.870
 sounds can be visualized and you always 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.819
 will see where they are shooting from or where 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.200
 sneaks the enemy along with the driver 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.349
 special software is being installed 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.970
 software and plug sonar raider he 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.099
 introduces over the screen with the game cassano 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.500
 reflecting the power of sound and on his 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.660
 direction we didn't have a shooter and we 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.880
 tried to work sonar with the game 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.040
 hitman absolution as you can see in native 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.990
 radar hitman and sanari information 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.780
 matches 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.959
 the sound comes from the same place 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.760
 cluster of enemies is the same with shots 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.980
 shooter where it is not always clear where 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.070
 firing the dream book raider will be like 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.840
 can not by the way jesus echelon is 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.510
 really great gaming set 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.220
 besides, we were pleased with camouflage only 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.450
 don't forget to buy a rug without it 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.390
 no particular sniper on this fighters 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.820
 your training course is completed use 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.430
 gained knowledge about gear wisely and 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.880
 get a tactical advantage on 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.880
 battlefield
