00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
of deal it's very similar from a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
of deal it's very similar from a
distance<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.500> these<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.770> over<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.040> place

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
distance I see these all over the place

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.580 
distance I see these all over the place
now<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.570> no<00:01:22.049> idea<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
now these I have no idea what this is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
now these I have no idea what this is
but<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.460> wild<00:01:24.210> raspberries<00:01:24.750> but

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
but this is not wild raspberries but

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.440 
but this is not wild raspberries but
from<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> distance<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> cluster<00:01:26.970> may

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
from a distance you know the cluster may

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
from a distance you know the cluster may
look<00:01:27.689> similar<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.829> bring<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.460> you'll

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
look similar if I bring in here you'll

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.569 
look similar if I bring in here you'll
see<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.329> yellow<00:01:30.720> centers<00:01:31.579> okay

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
see that these have yellow centers okay

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
see that these have yellow centers okay
and<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.450> mean<00:01:33.600> these<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.079> bush<00:01:34.439> also<00:01:34.680> has

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and then I mean these this bush also has

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.480 
and then I mean these this bush also has
thorns<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
thorns you see there so it can be a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.880 
thorns you see there so it can be a
little<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.850> confusing<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:40.020> um<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.650> an

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
little bit confusing but um this is an

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.789 
little bit confusing but um this is an
actual<00:01:41.070> bush<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.229> bring<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> back<00:01:43.470> over<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
actual bush and bring you back over to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.530 
actual bush and bring you back over to
the<00:01:43.979> raspberries<00:01:44.520> these<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.509> just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the raspberries these are just

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
the raspberries these are just
individual<00:01:46.229> stalks<00:01:46.619> okay<00:01:46.979> they're<00:01:47.189> not

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
individual stalks okay they're not

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.730 
individual stalks okay they're not
they're<00:01:48.270> clustered<00:01:48.540> together<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.409> appears

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
they're clustered together so it appears

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
they're clustered together so it appears
to<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:50.009> Bush<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.299> actually<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to be Bush like but it's not actually a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.889 
to be Bush like but it's not actually a
