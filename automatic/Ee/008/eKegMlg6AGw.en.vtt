00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
here's a venue that we're working with

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.420 
here's a venue that we're working with
here<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:14.460> sure<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.790> exact<00:00:15.299> dimensions<00:00:16.430> about

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
here not sure on exact dimensions about

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.099 
here not sure on exact dimensions about
15-foot<00:00:18.060> ceiling<00:00:18.539> while<00:00:18.690> we're<00:00:18.810> using<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
15-foot ceiling while we're using a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
15-foot ceiling while we're using a
standard<00:00:19.529> DMX<00:00:19.949> 55<00:00:20.460> controller<00:00:20.939> by<00:00:21.119> shava

standard DMX 55 controller by shava
again<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> pretty<00:00:22.320> affordable<00:00:22.590> as<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> see<00:00:23.220> we

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
again is pretty affordable as you see we

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.679 
again is pretty affordable as you see we
have<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.460> min<00:00:23.699> wash<00:00:23.910> trust<00:00:24.269> Mountain<00:00:24.600> the

great thing about the min wash is that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
great thing about the min wash is that
you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.500> access<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.010> macro<00:00:29.369> movements

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
you can access the macro movements

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.700 
you can access the macro movements
without<00:00:29.970> having<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> light<00:00:31.050> Jack<00:00:31.320> you're<00:00:31.560> any

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
without having a light Jack you're any

same feeling extra chain rule for you to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.569 
same feeling extra chain rule for you to
programming<00:00:48.649> as<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.190> color

the only program we had to do for the

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.610 
the only program we had to do for the
mid<00:01:16.800> washes<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> select<00:01:19.350> a

mid washes was to go in and select a
free<00:01:19.890> program<00:01:20.130> macro<00:01:20.970> setting<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.530> then

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
free program macro setting and then

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.170 
free program macro setting and then
change<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> color<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:24.690> red<00:01:28.940> another<00:01:29.940> cool

thing<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.450> min<00:01:30.780> washes<00:01:31.260> is<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> can

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
thing with min washes is that you can

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.400 
thing with min washes is that you can
set<00:01:32.070> their<00:01:32.220> pan<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> tilt<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.170> case

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.240 

have<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> strokes<00:01:50.670> again<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> free<00:01:51.900> program

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
have the strokes again in a free program

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.680 
have the strokes again in a free program
and<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.369> free<00:01:53.549> program

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.390 

and<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.380> only<00:01:57.440> thing<00:01:57.560> we've<00:01:57.740> done<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.040> adjust

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
and the only thing we've done to adjust

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.330 
and the only thing we've done to adjust
this<00:01:59.200> as<00:02:00.200> we've<00:02:00.470> said<00:02:00.650> different<00:02:01.010> steps<00:02:01.190> with

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
this as we've said different steps with

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.240 
this as we've said different steps with

different colors different scenes that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.160 
different colors different scenes that
we've<00:02:04.400> incorporated<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.940> jace<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.450> we've

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
we've incorporated a jace and we've

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.780
