00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
done and I'm just setting it with some

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
done and I'm just setting it with some
black<00:01:48.360> eyeshadow<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:50.130> hooded

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
black eyeshadow just I have hooded

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609 
black eyeshadow just I have hooded
eyelids<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.450> didn't<00:01:51.840> set<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.530> would

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
eyelids and I didn't set that it would

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
eyelids and I didn't set that it would
probably<00:01:52.860> smudge<00:01:53.340> into<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.760> upper<00:01:54.450> lid<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
probably smudge into my upper lid so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.950 
probably smudge into my upper lid so
that's<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.190> preventative<00:01:56.729> method<00:01:57.690> so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that's just a preventative method so

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:08.840 
that's just a preventative method so
there<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.830> on<00:01:59.070> both<00:01:59.400> eyelids<00:02:07.850> and
