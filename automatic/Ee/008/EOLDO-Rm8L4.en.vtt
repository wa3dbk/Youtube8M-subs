they<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.860> control<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.520> don't<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.270> there's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
they can control I don't think there's

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
they can control I don't think there's
any<00:00:36.600> country<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.230> region<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.340> being

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
any country in the region so this being

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.869 
any country in the region so this being
ASEAN<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:40.129> 1/10<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.309> much<00:00:41.550> power

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
ASEAN that has 1/10 of that much power

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.500 
ASEAN that has 1/10 of that much power
so<00:00:42.600> Thailand<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> probably<00:00:43.680> 2030<00:00:44.309> times<00:00:44.579> ahead

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so Thailand is probably 2030 times ahead

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.040 
so Thailand is probably 2030 times ahead
of<00:00:45.690> competitors<00:00:47.090> for<00:00:48.090> years<00:00:48.450> Thailand's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
to expand its solar power industry it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.720 
to expand its solar power industry it's
two<00:00:54.090> o'clock<00:00:54.210> peak<00:00:54.780> time<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.730> 600,000

now<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.430> don't<00:00:59.609> push<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> huge<00:01:00.239> amount<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
now they don't push a huge amount of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.029 
now they don't push a huge amount of

but the government and the investors are

but the government and the investors are
hoping<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.320> concept<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.100> mid-sized

decentralize the nation's power grid

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.679 
decentralize the nation's power grid
that<00:01:13.979> means<00:01:14.340> smaller<00:01:14.880> communities<00:01:15.450> can

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that means smaller communities can

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.100 
that means smaller communities can
