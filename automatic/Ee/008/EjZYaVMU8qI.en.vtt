00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.800
 Follow 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.800
ー

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.420
 Hmm 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.420
 Four days 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.749
 Oh 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.880
 I will 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 I will 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.390
 Would have been how the fact that Yes Eemaa brass shell 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:08.400
 I think this is cool in Nante me to go in the middle of the cat mud 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:12.750
 And to low floor number 8 tension die casting hoop 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.120
 Well, if you say the bug of the orb to light up, this is already 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.360
 It is high as an image 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:25.010
 Is it this image switch? 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.890
 And the like are already this tuning key to this hole is as interesting a bit of a gimmick 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.069
 Say that 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.000
 I'm a little happy bbiq but also 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.390
 For example yeah 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.730
 It is after 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:41.910
 A little sample notebook you'd are stuck and cs emperor of this white dot 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:48.720
 I did it with the usual cs coat and did it with the other tent 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.590
 Here will be slightly brighter sound if above a little Netto also from the time of the other logical pitch 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.540
 That's right 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.730
 Say moon 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.010
 Well at Tteyuu held together even at the Roppiko entered because I say I 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.079
 Snappy's response is also very good 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.980
 Sightseeing when going into middle high pitch from co-Oron pitch 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:11.530
 There is a feeling that it is still open brightly because it is a little Zuko 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.299
 It's so great that you can get Hakusan too 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:20.859
 When you want to put it out before you use it , you say it will be with the mind 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:24.130
 I do it that there is a facial expression because it is so public 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.910
 I already love this brass snare but 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.520
 Though in I love it it is to your chrome plated brass 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.419
 That's great that the good is out 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:40.460
 I think it's good, so I use a 5 inch brush for gun 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:43.159
 Delicious great at the Ronpitchi of in my impression something glass of Tsu snare if black bars 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:48.390
 But there is also an image that there is a 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:55.080
 Say delicious be carried out at the above be carried out at the above I O to the end 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:58.950
 Well of course the classic metal metal shell snare of the at Well afresh is in Gurekko 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:04.650
 But it is still great but I'm embarrassed even to say I'm great 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:08.240
 I think so, uh-this time it was Gino kid Gino 416 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.240
