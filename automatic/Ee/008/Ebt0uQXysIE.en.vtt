cameras basically if you have let's say
one<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> instances<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.040> 15<00:00:14.429> millimeter

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
one of the instances so 15 millimeter

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.550 
one of the instances so 15 millimeter

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
a polarizer or any filter will be

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.019 
a polarizer or any filter will be
actually<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.869> locate<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.310> number<00:00:29.730> right

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
actually you can locate the number right

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.170 
actually you can locate the number right
here<00:00:30.230> on<00:00:31.230> your<00:00:31.410> lens<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.009> will<00:00:32.279> say<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.969> this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
here on your lens it will say like this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.990 
here on your lens it will say like this
one<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.510> say<00:00:33.660> 52<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.950> although<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.640> 50

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
one will say 52 so although it's a 50

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.630 
one will say 52 so although it's a 50
millimeter<00:00:36.149> lens<00:00:36.860> okay<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.520> can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
millimeter lens okay right here you can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.709 
millimeter lens okay right here you can
see<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.590> look<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.719> 52

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
see that you do have to look for a 52

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.100 
see that you do have to look for a 52
millimeter<00:00:43.219> UV<00:00:44.390> filter<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.930> has<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
millimeter UV filter so this one has a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.619 
millimeter UV filter so this one has a
UV<00:00:46.379> filter<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> UV

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
UV filter on it as you can see that UV

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.689 
UV filter on it as you can see that UV
filter<00:00:48.989> says<00:00:49.579> 52<00:00:50.579> millimeter<00:00:51.270> okay<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
filter says 52 millimeter okay so that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.720 
filter says 52 millimeter okay so that
goes<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:55.020> example<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.370> goes

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
goes for that one for example it goes

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.510 
goes for that one for example it goes
the<00:00:56.910> same<00:00:56.940> thing<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.410> looking<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the same thing if you're looking for a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.189 
the same thing if you're looking for a
bigger<00:00:59.820> lens<00:01:00.000> such<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> one's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
bigger lens such as this one this one's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.969 
bigger lens such as this one this one's
a<00:01:01.350> 72<00:01:02.309> 300<00:01:03.000> millimeter<00:01:03.329> lens<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.890> not

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
a 72 300 millimeter lens so you're not

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.520 
a 72 300 millimeter lens so you're not
going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.339> searching<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:05.930> 70<00:01:06.930> millimeter

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
going to be searching for 70 millimeter

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.060 
going to be searching for 70 millimeter
lens<00:01:08.479> you'll<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.630> filtered<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
lens you'll be filtered you're going to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.420 
lens you'll be filtered you're going to
be<00:01:11.189> looking<00:01:12.080> again<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.680> lens<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
be looking again at your lens for the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.850 
be looking again at your lens for the
number<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.840> turn<00:01:16.080> around<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.619> lens

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
number so you just turn around your lens

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.920 
number so you just turn around your lens
and<00:01:17.250> look<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> number<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.860> go

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
and look for that number so there we go

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.749 
and look for that number so there we go
so<00:01:21.930> there's<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> number<00:01:22.560> once<00:01:22.979> again<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
so there's the number once again it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.149 
so there's the number once again it
tells<00:01:24.119> us<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.450> 58<00:01:25.110> millimeter<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
tells us out 58 millimeter so if you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
tells us out 58 millimeter so if you
look<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:28.909> UV<00:01:29.909> filter<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.479> put<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.840> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
look at the UV filter that I put on this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.350 
look at the UV filter that I put on this
one<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:32.460> will<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:35.360> 58

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
one you will see that it's a 58

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.609 
one you will see that it's a 58
millimeter<00:01:38.540> okay<00:01:39.540> doesn't<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> sides

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
millimeter okay doesn't see on the sides

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.450 
millimeter okay doesn't see on the sides
this<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.930> should<00:01:43.170> say<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> inside

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
this one so you should say in the inside

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.520 
this one so you should say in the inside
so<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> inside<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:47.720> filter<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.049> does<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
so in the inside of the filter it does a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.330 
so in the inside of the filter it does a
58<00:01:50.659> they<00:01:51.659> usually<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.350> outside<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
58 they usually go see outside but this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.870 
58 they usually go see outside but this
one<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:54.540> says<00:01:54.869> outside<00:01:55.560> anyways<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.759> how

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
one it says outside anyways that's how

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.149 
one it says outside anyways that's how
you<00:01:56.939> pick<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.450> filter<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.860> goes<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
you pick your filter for it it goes the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.389 
you pick your filter for it it goes the
same<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.700> any<00:01:59.909> type<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> lens<00:02:01.250> here<00:02:02.250> I've<00:02:02.369> got

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
same with any type of lens here I've got

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.800 
same with any type of lens here I've got
a<00:02:02.640> 10<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.240> 22<00:02:03.689> millimeter<00:02:04.290> lens<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.810> same

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a 10 to 22 millimeter lens and same

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.710 
a 10 to 22 millimeter lens and same
thing<00:02:07.140> you're<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.890> looking<00:02:08.720> for

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
thing you're going to be looking for

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
thing you're going to be looking for
this<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.470> example<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.430> filter<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.000> I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
this one for example the filter that I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.440 
this one for example the filter that I
have<00:02:12.420> on

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
have on

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.730 
have on
let's<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.750> take<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> quick<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.620> at<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:21.740> so

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
let's just take a quick look at it so

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.830 
let's just take a quick look at it so
same<00:02:22.950> thing<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.340> turn<00:02:23.850> around<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.540> look

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840

same thing you just turn around and look
for<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.110> number<00:02:27.350> okay<00:02:28.350> that's<00:02:28.530> why<00:02:28.680> we

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
for the number okay that's why we

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.410 
for the number okay that's why we
couldn't<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> number<00:02:29.730> anyways<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.300> this

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
couldn't see the number anyways and this

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.930 
couldn't see the number anyways and this
one's<00:02:30.600> not<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.810> visible<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:31.950> um<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.790> can

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
one's not that visible but um you can

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.000 
one's not that visible but um you can
see<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.120> through<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> lens<00:02:33.630> kinda<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.830> would

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
see it through the lens kinda this would

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.870 
see it through the lens kinda this would
be<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.360> type<00:02:36.360> polarizer<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.550> can't

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
be the type polarizer one so you can't

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.680 
be the type polarizer one so you can't
really<00:02:38.970> see<00:02:39.180> through<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.780> um<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:42.030> bad<00:02:42.210> example

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
really see through it um so bad example

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.480 
really see through it um so bad example
there<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.080> as<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.530> saw<00:02:43.710> in<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.890> other<00:02:44.100> lenses

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
there but as you saw in the other lenses

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.480 
there but as you saw in the other lenses
that's<00:02:45.000> how<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.150> pick<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:45.660> UV<00:02:46.140> filter<00:02:46.560> I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480
