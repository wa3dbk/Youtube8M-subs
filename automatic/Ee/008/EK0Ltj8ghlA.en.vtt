00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
careful

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.069 
careful
this<00:02:11.579> is<00:02:11.760> Jeep<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.090> jumping<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:12.840> one

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
this is Jeep was jumping and just one

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.690 
this is Jeep was jumping and just one
prick<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.590> needle<00:02:13.829> would<00:02:14.190> be<00:02:14.370> enough

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
prick of that needle would be enough

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.569 
prick of that needle would be enough
stop<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> man's<00:02:15.420> heart<00:02:15.660> as<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.769> grew<00:02:16.890> closer<00:02:17.190> it

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
stop a man's heart as we grew closer it

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.949 
stop a man's heart as we grew closer it
was<00:02:17.700> clear<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.239> would<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.569> have<00:02:18.720> one

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
was clear that we would just have one

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:19.789 
was clear that we would just have one
shot<00:02:18.989> at<00:02:19.290> this

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
shot at this

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.710 
shot at this
it<00:02:20.040> seems<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.670> other<00:02:20.849> rhinos<00:02:21.120> had<00:02:21.599> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
it seems like the other rhinos had the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.900 
it seems like the other rhinos had the
one<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.019> we<00:02:22.109> needed<00:02:22.349> blocked<00:02:22.799> in<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.639> this

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
one that we needed blocked in now this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.550 
one that we needed blocked in now this
was<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> young<00:02:24.299> black<00:02:24.480> rhino<00:02:24.870> he<00:02:25.109> would<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.349> way

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
was a young black rhino he would be way

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
was a young black rhino he would be way
more<00:02:25.590> aggressive<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.670> he<00:02:27.000> would<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.150> alone

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
more aggressive but he would be alone

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.960 
more aggressive but he would be alone
since<00:02:28.200> was<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.590> young<00:02:28.769> white<00:02:29.010> rhino<00:02:29.280> even

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
since was a young white rhino even

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.949 
since was a young white rhino even
though<00:02:30.060> they<00:02:30.180> tend<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.630> little<00:02:30.840> more

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
though they tend to be a little more

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.870 
though they tend to be a little more
