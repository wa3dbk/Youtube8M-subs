00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
open them up a little bit to see if it

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.460 
open them up a little bit to see if it
supports<00:06:23.430> his<00:06:23.820> ability<00:06:24.180> to<00:06:24.210> extend<00:06:24.660> they're

supports his ability to extend they're
going<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.740> deadlift<00:06:26.130> so<00:06:26.430> obviously<00:06:26.970> this<00:06:27.090> is<00:06:27.150> a

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
going to deadlift so obviously this is a

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.330 
going to deadlift so obviously this is a
lot<00:06:27.450> lighter<00:06:27.690> but<00:06:28.440> move<00:06:28.710> it<00:06:28.800> forward<00:06:29.130> some

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
lot lighter but move it forward some

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.120 
lot lighter but move it forward some
