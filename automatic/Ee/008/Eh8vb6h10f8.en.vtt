summer<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.780> hopefully<00:00:36.780> within<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.469> should

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
summer and hopefully within I should

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
summer and hopefully within I should
only<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.040> about<00:00:38.160> two<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.610> three<00:00:38.790> more<00:00:38.969> visits

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
only have about two or three more visits

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
only have about two or three more visits
which<00:00:40.050> should<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.440> only<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.340> six<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
which should be only you know six to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.580 
which should be only you know six to
eight<00:00:41.850> more<00:00:42.120> weeks<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.410> hoping

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
eight more weeks so I'm really hoping

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
eight more weeks so I'm really hoping
that<00:00:43.800> stays<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.340> track<00:00:44.579> all<00:00:45.329> he's<00:00:45.510> got<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> do

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that stays on track all he's got to do

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
that stays on track all he's got to do
is<00:00:46.020> close<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.739> little<00:00:46.829> gap<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> back

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is close up one little gap in the back

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.240 
is close up one little gap in the back
and<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.960> I'll<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.200> these<00:00:49.320> braces<00:00:49.620> off<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and then I'll get these braces off I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
and then I'll get these braces off I
still<00:00:50.879> haven't<00:00:51.030> started<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.539> jaw<00:00:51.930> surgery

blog com I'm still planning on doing
that<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.469> figured<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.489> close<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that I just figured some so close to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.599 
that I just figured some so close to
getting<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> braces<00:00:58.649> off<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.859> kind<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
getting the braces off and kind of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.970 
getting the braces off and kind of
completing<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> whole<00:01:00.359> process<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.770> just

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
completing the whole process that I just

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.130 
completing the whole process that I just
wait<00:01:02.190> until<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.550> done<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> whole

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
wait until that's done to get the whole

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.780 
wait until that's done to get the whole
site<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:04.949> I'll<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.369> gone

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
site up because then I'll have gone

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.130 
site up because then I'll have gone
through<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.600> beginning<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> end

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
through you know from beginning to end

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.880 
through you know from beginning to end
this<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.490> whole<00:01:08.700> thing<00:01:09.000> man<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.510> been<00:01:09.890> I'd

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
this this whole thing man it's been I'd

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.649 
this this whole thing man it's been I'd
have<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> look<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.880> easily<00:01:12.360> been

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
have to look it up but it's easily been

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
have to look it up but it's easily been
two<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.170> three<00:01:13.409> years<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.189> since<00:01:14.460> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
two or three years you know since this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.090 
two or three years you know since this
whole<00:01:14.880> process<00:01:15.210> started<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.619> definitely

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
whole process started so it's definitely

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
appointment on Tuesday last Tuesday was

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.730 
appointment on Tuesday last Tuesday was
just<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.970> midline<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.659> completely<00:01:31.290> corrected

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
just the midline is completely corrected

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.609 
just the midline is completely corrected
now<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.790> fixed<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:34.110> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
now so they got that fixed and then I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.880 
now so they got that fixed and then I
just<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> wear<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> rubber<00:01:36.299> bands<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
just have to wear the rubber bands you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
just have to wear the rubber bands you
can<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.220> right<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.640> there's<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.390> coming

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
can see right there there's one coming

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.200 
can see right there there's one coming
down<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> keep<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> midline

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
down like this just to keep the midline

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.090 
down like this just to keep the midline
right<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.040> just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
right and then there's one that just

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
right and then there's one that just
goes<00:01:44.490> along<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> top<00:01:45.320> that's<00:01:46.320> because

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
goes along the top that's because

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.730 
goes along the top that's because
there's<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.920> gap<00:01:47.130> between<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.930> teeth<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.290> couple

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
there's a gap between the teeth a couple

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.679 
there's a gap between the teeth a couple
teeth<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> back<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> top<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
teeth in the back on the top so that

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.260 
teeth in the back on the top so that
rubber<00:01:52.290> band<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.740> pulling<00:01:53.100> those<00:01:53.220> back<00:01:53.549> so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
rubber band is pulling those back so

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.399 
rubber band is pulling those back so
then<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> create<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.229> gap

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
then that's going to create a little gap

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
then that's going to create a little gap
right<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> move<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.759> over

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
right here then you have to move it over

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
right here then you have to move it over
