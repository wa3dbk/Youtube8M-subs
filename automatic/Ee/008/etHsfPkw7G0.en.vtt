Value+ IUL, permanent life insurance
that can help create long-term security.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.880
Many people who own term life insurance see it as

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.050
throwing money down the drain. They pay
premiums until the level term is over

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.270
then drop it, never getting the death
benefit. Or they keep it and see the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.910
premiums jump dramatically.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.140
Value+ IUL is permanent indexed universal life insurance.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.300
Premiums paid accumulate values that are accessible to supplement your retirement or

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.160
any other purpose. Additionally the death
benefit may be used to provide funds in

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.370
the event of a qualifying chronic illness.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.569
Your money doesn't go down the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.079
drain, it's there for you and your beneficiaries

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.010

its difficult or costly to access your cash,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.469
especially without reducing your death benefit. But a lifetime is a long time,

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.659

opportunities might arise.
