seized in there we try to take a jack

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
seized in there we try to take a jack
and<00:00:21.180> lift<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> up<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.650> won't<00:00:22.949> come<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.250> so

and lift it up it they won't come out so

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.560 
and lift it up it they won't come out so
that's<00:00:23.699> pretty<00:00:23.970> much<00:00:24.029> what<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.449> do

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
that's pretty much what we have to do

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.420 
that's pretty much what we have to do
just<00:00:24.869> make<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> crumple<00:00:25.980> right<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.279> or

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
just make it crumple right there or

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.800 
just make it crumple right there or
wrinkle<00:00:26.789> right<00:00:26.910> there

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
wrinkle right there

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.620 
wrinkle right there
but<00:00:28.500> what<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.400> doing<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> pool<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> want

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
but what we doing to pool what you want

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.790 
but what we doing to pool what you want
to<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> want<00:00:31.050> measure<00:00:31.230> your<00:00:31.529> sides

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to do is you want measure your sides

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.170 
to do is you want measure your sides
first<00:00:32.540> my<00:00:33.540> ones<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.899> 20<00:00:34.670> 21<00:00:35.670> inches<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.149> think

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
first my ones like 20 21 inches I think

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
first my ones like 20 21 inches I think
somewhere<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.680> then<00:00:38.100> measure

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
somewhere like that and then measure

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.889 
somewhere like that and then measure
your<00:00:38.879> ATAR<00:00:39.180> your<00:00:40.079> pool<00:00:40.290> cover<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.899> see

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
your ATAR your pool cover out and see

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.030 
your ATAR your pool cover out and see
what<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> difference<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.649> got<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
what kind of difference you got then you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.319 
what kind of difference you got then you
just<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.280> make<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.550> equal<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.910> both<00:00:44.940> sides

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
just will make them equal on both sides

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.529 
just will make them equal on both sides
and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:47.579> got<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:47.820> straps<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and then you got your straps like this

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.260 
and then you got your straps like this
and<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.170> happens<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:51.000> drill

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and what happens is you just got drill

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.729 
and what happens is you just got drill
holes<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.610> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.149> use<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:55.559> see

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
holes and this is the bit we use you see

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.000 
holes and this is the bit we use you see
there<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.730> 3/4<00:00:57.239> bit<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
there you get to use the 3/4 bit and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.439 
there you get to use the 3/4 bit and
just<00:00:59.010> use<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> red<00:00:59.399> gold<00:00:59.550> hammer<00:00:59.789> drill<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
just use the red gold hammer drill and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.630 
just use the red gold hammer drill and
make<00:01:00.660> sure<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.430> if<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> get

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
make sure it's got the little if you get

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.709 
make sure it's got the little if you get
the<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> grooves

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the bit make sure it's got the grooves

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
the bit make sure it's got the grooves
like<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.739> picture<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:05.129> there

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
like you see that picture right there

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
like you see that picture right there
tor<00:01:06.030> has<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.630> hold<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
tor has a good hold to it they use a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.140 
tor has a good hold to it they use a
hammer<00:01:08.130> drill<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.670> drill<00:01:08.820> them<00:01:08.909> holes<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
hammer drill you can drill them holes a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.030 
hammer drill you can drill them holes a
lot<00:01:09.270> faster<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.110> concrete<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
lot faster and a concrete just like you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.600 
lot faster and a concrete just like you
see<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.259> way<00:01:16.380> we've<00:01:16.530> done<00:01:16.619> ours<00:01:17.009> we

see there but the way we've done ours we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.240 
see there but the way we've done ours we
just<00:01:17.820> stretch<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> straps<00:01:18.450> across<00:01:19.189> once<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
just stretch the straps across once you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.230 
just stretch the straps across once you
got<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:21.020> pool<00:01:22.020> cover<00:01:22.259> equal<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.710> both<00:01:22.740> sides

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
got your pool cover equal on both sides

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.300 
got your pool cover equal on both sides
drill<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.390> hole<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> very<00:01:25.229> end<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.710> then

buckets I had a bucket full of rocks I
had<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> couple<00:01:38.610> buckets<00:01:38.850> full<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.180> water<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
had a couple buckets full of water that

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.450 
had a couple buckets full of water that
we<00:01:40.170> used<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.500> these<00:01:40.650> corners<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.159> help<00:01:41.310> hold

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
we used on these corners that help hold

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.510 
we used on these corners that help hold
the<00:01:41.729> cover<00:01:42.479> across<00:01:43.070> where<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.369> our

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the cover across where we can get our

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
the cover across where we can get our
measurements<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.390> stuff<00:01:45.479> trying<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> try<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
measurements and stuff trying to try to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.929 
measurements and stuff trying to try to
get<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> equal<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.549> can

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
get a equal as much as we can

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.050 
get a equal as much as we can
has<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> diving<00:01:49.110> board<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> they

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
has that diving board off and they

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
has that diving board off and they
didn't<00:01:51.299> use<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> stainless<00:01:51.810> steel<00:01:51.990> bolts

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
didn't use the stainless steel bolts

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.819 
didn't use the stainless steel bolts
like<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> should<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.600> anchors<00:01:54.600> no<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.409> all

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
like it should have anchors no so all

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
like it should have anchors no so all
that<00:01:55.979> stuff<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.250> pretty<00:01:56.759> much<00:01:56.850> broke<00:01:57.090> apart

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that stuff just pretty much broke apart

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.690 
that stuff just pretty much broke apart
I<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.159> I'll<00:01:59.159> probably<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.549> take<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
I want the I'll probably just take a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429 
I want the I'll probably just take a
grinder<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.210> grind<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.659> flush<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
grinder and grind them down flush and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.190 
grinder and grind them down flush and
then<00:02:02.250> take<00:02:02.820> my<00:02:02.969> diving<00:02:03.869> board<00:02:04.049> either

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
then take my diving board either

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.889 
then take my diving board either
probably<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> move<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> back<00:02:05.340> since<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
probably have to move it back since that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.809 
probably have to move it back since that
cover<00:02:06.899> bolts<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> way<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.340> Martha<00:02:08.520> move<00:02:08.700> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
cover bolts in the way so Martha move it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.520 
cover bolts in the way so Martha move it
back<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.149> an<00:02:09.360> inch<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:09.869> rejoin<00:02:10.410> me

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
back about an inch and then rejoin me

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990 
back about an inch and then rejoin me
some<00:02:10.679> holes<00:02:10.830> put<00:02:11.009> some<00:02:11.220> stainless<00:02:11.819> tool

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
some holes put some stainless tool

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.320 
some holes put some stainless tool
anchors<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.660> there

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
anchors in there

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.390 
anchors in there
that's<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.570> as<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.350> there<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:17.250> green

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
that's it as you see there that green

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.280 
that's it as you see there that green
stuff<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:17.940> there<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.080> best

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
stuff you see there that's the best

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.900 
stuff you see there that's the best
thing<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.770> probably<00:02:20.310> cheapest<00:02:20.700> thing<00:02:20.790> that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
thing and probably cheapest thing that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.810 
thing and probably cheapest thing that
we<00:02:20.970> could<00:02:21.120> think<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> use<00:02:22.280> along<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.460> edges

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
we could think of to use along the edges

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.810 
we could think of to use along the edges
down<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> edges<00:02:24.900> right<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.820> will

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
down for the edges right here will

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.720 
down for the edges right here will
actually<00:02:27.330> rub<00:02:27.570> into<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.050> pool<00:02:28.890> cover<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.610> we

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
actually rub into the pool cover so we

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.270 
actually rub into the pool cover so we
use<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.420> outdoor<00:02:30.660> carpet<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.680> was<00:02:31.920> I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
use just the outdoor carpet it was I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.540 
use just the outdoor carpet it was I
think<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.700> $0.50<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.600> square<00:02:34.230> foot<00:02:34.500> or<00:02:35.340> poor

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
think like $0.50 a square foot or poor

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.390 
think like $0.50 a square foot or poor
linear<00:02:35.850> foot<00:02:36.410> something<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.280> it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
linear foot something like that but it

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.860 
linear foot something like that but it
was<00:02:38.490> cheaper<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.760> didn't<00:02:39.090> pay<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.570> 50

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
was cheaper I didn't pay but like 50

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.380 
was cheaper I didn't pay but like 50
bucks<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> got<00:02:40.530> 10<00:02:41.010> 12<00:02:41.790> foot<00:02:41.940> long<00:02:42.090> pieces

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
bucks and I got 10 12 foot long pieces

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.800 
bucks and I got 10 12 foot long pieces
and<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.680> dummy<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.580> around<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.750> I

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
and it dummy all the way around and I

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.130 
and it dummy all the way around and I
had<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.959> little<00:02:46.080> bit<00:02:46.230> extra<00:02:46.440> left<00:02:46.530> over<00:02:48.140> but

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
had a little bit extra left over but

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.449 
had a little bit extra left over but
that's<00:02:49.230> what<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.500> want<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.709> use<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.250> side

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
that's what you want to use on the side

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.830 
that's what you want to use on the side
that<00:02:50.670> way<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.790> pulled<00:02:51.120> over<00:02:51.330> last<00:02:51.450> longer

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that way you pulled over last longer

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.190 
that way you pulled over last longer
than<00:02:51.989> won't<00:02:52.230> tear<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:53.190> wind<00:02:53.489> blowing

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
than won't tear as a wind blowing

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.290 
than won't tear as a wind blowing
another<00:02:55.200> good<00:02:55.380> idea<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.890> get<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.940> some<00:02:57.090> any

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
another good idea to get you some any

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.080 
another good idea to get you some any
seeds<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.440> putting<00:02:58.680> your<00:02:58.770> boats<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.880> we<00:02:59.970> have

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
seeds and putting your boats now we have

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.550 
seeds and putting your boats now we have
to<00:03:00.180> worry<00:03:00.300> about<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.570> seasoned<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.020> Ruston<00:03:01.500> or

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
to worry about it seasoned up Ruston or

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.780 
to worry about it seasoned up Ruston or
anything<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:01.920> any<00:03:02.100> kind<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.370> corrosion<00:03:02.550> get

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
anything like any kind of corrosion get

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.070 
anything like any kind of corrosion get
off<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.970> identical<00:03:03.239> especially<00:03:03.750> as<00:03:03.810> being

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
off the identical especially as being

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.640 
off the identical especially as being
brass

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
brass

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.530 
brass
I<00:03:04.680> know<00:03:05.580> brass<00:03:05.880> won't<00:03:06.120> corrode<00:03:06.270> or<00:03:06.330> anything

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
I know brass won't corrode or anything

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.000 
I know brass won't corrode or anything
but<00:03:06.780> still<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.110> get<00:03:07.200> stuff<00:03:07.440> off<00:03:07.590> out<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:07.890> there

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
but still you get stuff off out in there

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.690 
but still you get stuff off out in there
and<00:03:08.130> it'll<00:03:08.250> strip<00:03:09.120> or<00:03:09.420> screw<00:03:09.900> up<00:03:10.050> real<00:03:10.230> easier

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
and it'll strip or screw up real easier

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.890 
and it'll strip or screw up real easier
right<00:03:11.700> verse<00:03:11.820> 2<00:03:12.000> wheel<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:12.690> that's<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:14.900> guys
