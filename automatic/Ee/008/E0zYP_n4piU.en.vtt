more efficient driving environment what
we<00:00:19.710> wanted<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> research<00:00:21.000> platform<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
we wanted was a research platform that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
we wanted was a research platform that

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
different about this car is that it can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.220 
different about this car is that it can
see<00:00:45.480> what's<00:00:46.320> around<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.090> 360<00:00:48.090> degrees<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.809> the

situational awareness understand what's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.310 
situational awareness understand what's
happening<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.970> able<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.540> react<00:01:06.930> to

happening and will be able to react to

happening and will be able to react to
what's<00:01:08.280> happening<00:01:08.430> around<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.450> inform<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
what's happening around it or inform the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
what's happening around it or inform the
driver<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> driver<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.280> react<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> what's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
driver so the driver can react to what's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.109 
driver so the driver can react to what's
going<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.479> around<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.409> pulse<00:01:13.920> goes<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
going on around it a pulse goes out it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.090 
going on around it a pulse goes out it
bounces<00:01:15.570> off<00:01:15.720> an<00:01:15.900> object<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> comes

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
bounces off an object and then it comes

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
bounces off an object and then it comes
back<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.630> time<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> takes<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> go

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
back and then the time it takes to go

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
back and then the time it takes to go
out<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> come<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.930> measure<00:01:21.930> them

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
out and come back we can measure them

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.219 
out and come back we can measure them
the<00:01:22.380> distance<00:01:22.770> from<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> source<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
the distance from the source to the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.870 
the distance from the source to the
object<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.890> use<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.310> light

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
object so that's what we use like light

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.620 
object so that's what we use like light
is<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.780> faster<00:01:28.049> than<00:01:28.409> sound<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:30.150> much

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
is much faster than sound it has much

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.660 
is much faster than sound it has much
more<00:01:30.659> fidelity<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:31.979> smaller<00:01:32.280> pixel

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
more fidelity we get much smaller pixel

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.210 
more fidelity we get much smaller pixel
size<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.360> essentially<00:01:34.290> HD<00:01:34.500> tight

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
size so we can get essentially HD tight

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
size so we can get essentially HD tight
quality<00:01:35.759> imagery<00:01:36.329> off<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> lidar<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
quality imagery off of the lidar and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.060 
quality imagery off of the lidar and
with<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.509> 3d<00:01:40.350> images<00:01:40.860> or

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
with that then we can make 3d images or

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.429 
with that then we can make 3d images or
very<00:01:41.490> detailed<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.119> accurate<00:01:42.329> maps<00:01:43.020> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
very detailed and accurate maps that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
very detailed and accurate maps that
look<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> would<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
look like what you would see in a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
look like what you would see in a
high-end<00:01:45.930> video<00:01:46.590> game<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.759> look

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
high-end video game and we really look

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
high-end video game and we really look
at<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.600> extension<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.259> many<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
at it as an extension of many of the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.139 
at it as an extension of many of the
technologies<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.490> we've<00:01:50.759> got<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:50.970> our

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
technologies that we've got in our

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.660 
technologies that we've got in our
vehicles<00:01:51.630> today<00:01:52.189> things<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.369> park

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
vehicles today things like park
