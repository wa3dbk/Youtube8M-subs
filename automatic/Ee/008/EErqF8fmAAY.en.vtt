00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello, let's prepare a hamburger 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.929
 homemade style I already know that the model 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.059
 original does not carry cheese but I like it 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.059
 put cheese on hamburgers 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.410
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.480
 for meat are 400 grams of meat 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.119
 beef two hamburgers come out two 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.119
 teaspoons of bovril salt and pepper 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.640
 and for the assembly of the hamburger 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.620
 we're going to need a muffin 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.020
 big hamburger lettuce cut 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.899
 sliced ​​tomato onion and rings 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.140
 Gherkins sliced ​​a slice of cheese &amp; 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.850
 sweet ' monesa we begin we will begin 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.309
 throwing the two teaspoons of cover 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:59.220
 in the flesh we will be a little meat 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:02.440
 with the cell phone then we put the salt 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.269
 the pepper 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.130
 with very clean hands we started to 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:14.200
 Mix all the ingredients well 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:16.600
 mixed now we will think the meat and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.540
 we will take 200 grams of it 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.700
 we'll make a ball and start giving it 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.290
 form with the hands but not those of a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.290
 baking paper and a rolling pin 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.690
 We will try to make the hamburger a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.369
 little bigger than the muffin 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.759
 burgers since the griddle then 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.830
 tends to reduce when we already have the 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.060
 hamburger with the desired shape we passed 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.970
 to toast the bagels 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.540
 once we toasted the river and remove them 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.030
 we reserve 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.760
 and let's go with the hamburger we'll put it 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.010
 in the river irons at medium heat you have to 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.440
 leave it well toasted when it is for a 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.850
 side we will turn around and when the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.490
 we have finished we take it out of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.750
 reserved and we go with the assembly of the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.630
 hamburger we take the lid of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.220
 muffin and we spread mayonnaise we extend 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:19.740
 well the mayonnaise on top we will put 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 lettuce cut two slices of tomato and 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.360
 three onion habits we take the part 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.240
 below the muffin we put the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.740
 cheese 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:38.000
 on top of our meat burger 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.000
 sliced ​​gherkins 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.390
 and finally ketchup forming a 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.670
 spiral now very carefully we put together 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.500
 both parties and we already have our 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.750
 prepared hamburger and here we have it 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.090
 a great homemade hamburger style 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.560
 water that has nothing to envy 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.810
 the famous hamburgers of this chain of 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.730
 restaurants we can serve them with some 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.940
 potatoes and drink them with a soft drink 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.010
 I hope you liked us 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.010
