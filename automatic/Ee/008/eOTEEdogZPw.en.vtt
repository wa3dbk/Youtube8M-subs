00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.070
 hello today we will learn to make a nice 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:11.120
 santaclÃ³s hat the materials are 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:15.019
 a felt scissors of white color and 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.430
 red a silicon pistol and a leaf 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.790
 white to draw a triangle 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.180
 As a first step we will fold the sheet to the 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:30.230
 half the longest 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.840
 the next step is to place a rule or 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.890
 a stick what you have on hand for 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.890
 draw a line from one end to the other 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.650
 once we draw our sheet we will start 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650
 shorten 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.950
 once finished cutting we will open 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.950
 our sheet and we see that we have one 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.970
 triangle later we will take the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.340
 red felt and we'll fold it in half 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.540
 and we will put our triangle and 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.540
 we will begin to cut 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.079
 already finished cutting our felt 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.490
 what it does now is put silicone in the 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:19.210
 part of the shore and thus join them 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 and go hitting 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.980
 with the white felt we will cut a 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.090
 circle we will bend our felt 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.549
 and we will cut 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.799
 from one extreme to the other and what 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.799
 we will use is the tip 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:48.090
 obtaining our circle what 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.090
 we will do is cut a strip 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.190
 once trimmed our material 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.620
 we will stick the red circle in the part 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.620
 top with a drop of silicone 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.010
 and the strip will be paid in the part 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.010
 lower 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.899
 we will place the silicon in a stripe 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.410
 once finished our hat we 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.330
 it will stay like this if you liked the video
