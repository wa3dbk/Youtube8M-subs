00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.040
 the last days 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.460

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:06.280

 this is the starting point from here with your acts the inhabitants of the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
 city ​​considered the hollow a villain 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.710
 morals said today

 is what some will do 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.710
 gates that we can perform with electricity 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.870
 and that we will buy with the money that we obtain in our missions 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.280
 We will have to overcome these riot police and we want to leave 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.080
 After a couple of guards is that the crowd sure I can start a 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.110
 riot would serve to distract your attention 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.539
 clear that a lot of innocent people 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.509
 I was going to die 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.880
 apart from attacking enemies launching downloads there are also more attacks 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.270
 powerful 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.050
 sion of wind to get up 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.970
 poe take them to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.590
 friends to then highlight the opposites 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.160
 among others 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.260
 although if we do not like to use our powers, there are always punches and 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.420
 kicks 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.049
 electricity we not only use it to defeat our opponents 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.569
 that by the way there is coca parity 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.599
 but with nothing 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.209
 artificial intelligence here but thanks to them we slide over 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.189
 rails 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.710
 we emphasize batteries 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.460
 we heal innocent people or he called six things he said to paralyze 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.649
 to the enemies 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.129
 another of the performances 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.980
 explained hunt can see the future today unveil where in the city 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.570
 find 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.439
 the sources of energy 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.480
 energy will be essential and will be represented in a few points in the part 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.949
 top of the screen 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.799
 that will run out if we use our special attack skills 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.389
 we should look for sources of electricity 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:47.789
 we can also do 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.549
 to recover our life 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.340
 but not all are rays with can also jump very high 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.219
 hold on by the cornices 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.629
 spa and evil style 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.519
 the missions that we find in the prime bush are of great variety although to the 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.749
 end they end up bored because many repeats 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.849
 maybe the side missions that are represented 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.629
 that a train full of passengers would be saved so eliminate cameras 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.949
 security 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.419
 mentioned in this game to restore normal life in the area we want 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.429
 return the light to the street and clean the place of the closers 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:32.099
 but beyond these objectives the duration of the title is extended 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.459
 entrusted us with missions was to look for a certain number of accesses throughout the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.909
 scenario and if we can leave to perform at any time 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.429
 a two year old son 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:45.949
 is that sometimes it does nothing 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.869
 to choose between pine 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.950
 and our level of villain to hero 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.950
 the premises will be represented in it 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.149
 Let's paint is a title that is characterized by a broad setting and 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:01.969
 especially for its complete freedom of movement but as it already happens with others 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:02.519
 games 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.370
 the freedom only reduces the Balearic through the streets and the character can not 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.249
 be demanded in almost no building 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.499
 and so increase the gameplay 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.139
 the streets are important 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.799
 but the roofs too, so our game will be developed 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.079
 especially in the two places 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.759
 leaving aside the sites with water as the frame sources 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.749
 because if you have not noticed yet 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:30.090
 we are elected 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.180
 sony's new bet lacks some details regarding the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.930
 playability 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.060
 as the possibility that it also grants booty of vehicles for 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.080
 travel 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.020
 what has surprised us the most is a work done with lighting 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.819
 becoming very realistic both on the exterior and interior stages 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:49.810
 in the same way 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.460
 the feeling that each building is different 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.009
 and its large polygonal load 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.629
 without slowdowns 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.860
 make the title worthy in this field although sometimes 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.779
 textures 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.779
 not be all Buenos Aires city could have been 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.309
 but it is solved with other aspects of the title 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:08.360
 As is known 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.069
 and is that this official his dubbing in Spanish and how the story is told 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.080
 through this one where they look like comic books 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.650
 We infer that it will be stuck to the TV for about 36 hours 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.199
 rescue given in flour 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.979
 impossible jumps and supernatural powers was to explain the 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.139
 true story of 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.490
 There he continues but not everything is so in all his missions they can reach and 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.490
 It has a high similarity with other products such as cocoa 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:39.389
 but its originality that in the argument the possibility of being the good bad 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.699
 make it move away from any other title leading so you know that 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.150
 choose to be 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.810
 official
