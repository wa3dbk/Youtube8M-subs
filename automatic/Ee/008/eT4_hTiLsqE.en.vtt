00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
has a pretty cool design line which is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.020 
has a pretty cool design line which is
both<00:02:04.140> mesh<00:02:04.679> and<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.399> windows<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.940> have

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
both mesh and the windows so you have

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
both mesh and the windows so you have
your<00:02:06.060> larger<00:02:06.509> window<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:07.050> which<00:02:07.530> will

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
your larger window up here which will

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.380 
your larger window up here which will
allow<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.399> pretty<00:02:08.640> much<00:02:08.729> most<00:02:09.119> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
allow you to see pretty much most of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.449 
allow you to see pretty much most of
your<00:02:09.630> system<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.190> mesh

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
your system and then you have to mesh

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.850 
your system and then you have to mesh
sections<00:02:11.940> down<00:02:12.090> here<00:02:12.390> behind<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.500> mesh

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
sections down here behind this mesh

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.930 
sections down here behind this mesh
section<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.610> another<00:02:15.390> 200<00:02:16.020> millimeter<00:02:16.440> fan

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
section is another 200 millimeter fan

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.280 
section is another 200 millimeter fan
another<00:02:17.940> thing<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.420> wanted<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.900> point<00:02:19.140> out

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
another thing that I wanted to point out

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.110 
another thing that I wanted to point out
while<00:02:19.530> we're<00:02:19.650> taking<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> look<00:02:20.069> at<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.550> side<00:02:20.849> of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
while we're taking a look at the side of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.839 
while we're taking a look at the side of
the<00:02:21.209> case<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.959> actually<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.890> large<00:02:23.160> feet<00:02:23.580> here

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
the case is actually the large feet here

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.250 
the case is actually the large feet here
this<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.240> pretty<00:02:24.510> cool-looking<00:02:24.810> design

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
this is a pretty cool-looking design

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.900 
this is a pretty cool-looking design
it's<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> little<00:02:26.490> something<00:02:26.730> different

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
it's just a little something different

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.330 
it's just a little something different
normally<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:27.990> see<00:02:28.260> normal<00:02:28.650> case<00:02:28.860> D<00:02:29.130> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
normally you just see normal case D I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.699 
normally you just see normal case D I
like<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.880> NZXT<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.690> kind<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.140> outside

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
like that NZXT is kind of going outside

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the box and made this look you know if

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:33.480 
the box and made this look you know if
you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
you

can see a hundred and forty millimeter
exhaust<00:02:41.170> fan<00:02:41.410> right<00:02:41.590> here<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.040> they<00:02:42.520> have

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
exhaust fan right here and they have

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.730 
exhaust fan right here and they have
used<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.970> same<00:02:43.150> system<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:44.080> they<00:02:44.110> had<00:02:44.440> on

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
used the same system that they had on

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.220 
used the same system that they had on
their<00:02:44.770> switch<00:02:45.340> 810<00:02:45.640> case<00:02:46.150> which<00:02:46.660> allows<00:02:46.990> you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
their switch 810 case which allows you

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.560 
their switch 810 case which allows you
to<00:02:47.410> move<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.770> fan<00:02:47.950> up<00:02:48.190> or<00:02:48.400> down<00:02:48.580> however<00:02:49.330> you

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
to move the fan up or down however you

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.270 
to move the fan up or down however you
would<00:02:49.690> like<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.050> so<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.290> lines<00:02:50.530> up<00:02:50.800> perfectly

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
would like it so it lines up perfectly

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.360 
would like it so it lines up perfectly
with<00:02:51.370> your<00:02:51.910> CPU<00:02:52.870> they<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.770> by<00:02:54.010> using

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
with your CPU they do this by using

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.030 
with your CPU they do this by using
these<00:02:54.640> slit<00:02:55.060> system<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:56.290> these<00:02:56.410> large<00:02:56.740> slits

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
these slit system just these large slits

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.500 
these slit system just these large slits
