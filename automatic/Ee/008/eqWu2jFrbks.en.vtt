give<00:03:20.010> them<00:03:20.220> props<00:03:20.610> for<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.060> think<00:03:21.390> it's

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
give them props for that I think it's

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.610 
give them props for that I think it's
important<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:21.960> they're<00:03:22.200> doing<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
important that they're doing that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.770 
important that they're doing that
because<00:03:22.980> Android<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.760> very<00:03:23.970> powerful<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:24.660> on

because Android is very powerful but on

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.240 
because Android is very powerful but on
it<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.410> little<00:03:25.620> bit<00:03:25.800> daunting

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
it so it can be a little bit daunting

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.030 
it so it can be a little bit daunting
perhaps<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.420> first<00:03:27.720> time<00:03:27.900> user<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.470> you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
perhaps to the first time user and you

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.200 
perhaps to the first time user and you
know<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.160> think<00:03:29.310> t-mobile's<00:03:29.820> done<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> nice<00:03:30.150> job

action in the android market many more

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.910 
action in the android market many more
apps<00:04:11.550> coming<00:04:11.820> out<00:04:12.200> but<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.410> meantime<00:04:13.620> you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
apps coming out but in the meantime you

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.290 
apps coming out but in the meantime you
know<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.190> still<00:04:14.520> less<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.090> mainstream

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
know it's still less of a mainstream

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.699 
know it's still less of a mainstream
consumer<00:04:15.870> thing<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.200> more<00:04:16.290> of<00:04:16.350> kind<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.620> a

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
consumer thing and more of kind of a

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.490 
consumer thing and more of kind of a
geek<00:04:16.890> thing<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.810> think<00:04:18.900> t-mobile<00:04:19.140> did

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
geek thing and so I think t-mobile did

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.930 
geek thing and so I think t-mobile did
well<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.950> try<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.160> position<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.670> as<00:04:20.730> a

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
well to try to position this as a

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.450 
well to try to position this as a
consumer<00:04:21.359> device<00:04:22.010> almost<00:04:23.010> like<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.340> know<00:04:23.430> a
