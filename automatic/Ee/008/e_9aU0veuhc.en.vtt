00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.189
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.039
 this video where I will present you how 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.930
 create a multiplayer san andreas server 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.540
 then and let's go on sa indent emp 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.850
 point com that would be site of the hall 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.750
 multiplayer andreas 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.040
 after that we went to samp punto com 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.150
 let's go to the download section very well 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.100
 now we go down below we find samp 0.3 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.000
 hicks windows server 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000
 click here 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.100
 very well we are now downloading the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.700
 gta san andreas server package 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 after downloading it downloaded it 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.939
 we extract some yellow I in some folder 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.130
 mining efforts have here then before 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.689
 start our server we go on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.939
 11 feg server 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.899
 very well here it is then 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.920
 now we have to change by force with 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:32.369
 password that this would be here that al 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.590
 moment cells if you sing here if not 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.500
 changed it the server will not start 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 so let's put a password for example 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.729
 1 2 and 3 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.090
 max player then these are the slots 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.470
 available slots available and up 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.250
 to a maximum of 500 slots and the door there 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.729
 door and the main one is set 6 4 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.729
 set 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.480
 it's the door has to be with 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.270
 four numbers can also be 5 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:13.970
 numbers like for example I don't know 25 10 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.970
 for example hostname then the stellar 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.299
 the name from serious therefore for example 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.299
 let's put some sandri sites 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.520
 that is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.890
 here 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.530
 what way then the way at the moment is 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:35.020
 true that it is followed by the number one hub 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.200
 and fall street and now we have we go 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.660
 on the web web indicates the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.220
 link your forum so for example 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:50.930
 put www.fanpage.it cpr fi.it 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.950
 of course an example the site I believe 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.290
 that does not exist anyway if not there 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.250
 we give the server in the san check map 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.959
 andreas 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.590
 but we can change it 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.680
 adding map name and here 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.430
 we write for example los santos 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.769
 or that I know the misfortune 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:21.620
 an example later we save it very well 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:24.579
 now we have the faun a1 and we open the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.620
 our mode that would be the bea 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.830
 we click twice very well but here it is 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.980
 here 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.630
 and the envelope that fashions only a few lines 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.880
 as you see 91 lines with respect to one 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.430
 how roleplay is not really 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.340
 nothing because it is the rose to many 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.530
 so think lines 30,000 and b that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.030
 about 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.270
 but they are not all the same and 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.150
 naturally when we go naturally 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.630
 we see phillips bars in the mouth words 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.240
 all the name of the gameboard and us 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.709
 we can change the name by ctrl 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.500
 more h 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:08.120
 answers this box here we write 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.520
 badly written badly and we must 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.020
 change in what I know 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.940
 at constant exchange rates hot 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.859
 let's go on ok and put astor 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.780
 great after changing ours 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.200
 game mode is not finished yet because 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.950
 we have to click this here 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.810
 square where there is this blue sign 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.330
 we publish and see if you will give us today 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.610
 of course not turning the errors that 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.610
 how we get out 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.690
 great time to start the server ourselves 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.510
 what do we have to do 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.530
 then we have to click samb dash 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.530
 need this here 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.870
 and now our server is already started 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.760
 let's go to the launch 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.760
 let's see if grass has been activated 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.120
 has reached 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.009
 let's say you charge 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.460
 sure i was wrong 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.810
 rightly I put the door 7 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.439
 always 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:36.610
 tomorrow is the time when there are those who do not 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:40.210
 they can as well in the middle 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.509
 here it is as said so configured 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.820
 with vinci citycar 12 script the misfortune 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:55.240
 for mom 500 slots e 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:58.660

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.130
 forum vabbÃ¨ I put a site any 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:06.509

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.740
 if you want to know what happened to 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.870
 always maybe you left it on and 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.240
 you don't know what happened 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.099

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:27.400
 which was written in 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:34.090
 in this program that would be what 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:36.910
 start the server see all here 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:41.590
