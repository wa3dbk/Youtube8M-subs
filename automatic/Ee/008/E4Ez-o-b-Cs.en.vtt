Europe that we're working with where
they<00:00:26.590> can<00:00:26.830> purify<00:00:27.310> ocean<00:00:27.880> water<00:00:28.060> so<00:00:28.240> there's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
they can purify ocean water so there's

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.999 
they can purify ocean water so there's
no<00:00:28.630> industrial<00:00:28.929> contaminants<00:00:29.470> at<00:00:29.830> all

opsys<00:00:37.239> out<00:00:37.989> of<00:00:38.760> 40,000<00:00:39.760> they<00:00:39.850> thought<00:00:40.059> well

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
opsys out of 40,000 they thought well

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.820 
opsys out of 40,000 they thought well
because<00:00:40.750> of<00:00:40.900> Jacques<00:00:41.049> Cousteau<00:00:41.500> bunch<00:00:41.710> of

because of Jacques Cousteau bunch of

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.899 
because of Jacques Cousteau bunch of
scientists<00:00:42.159> got<00:00:42.250> together<00:00:42.400> and<00:00:42.610> said<00:00:42.699> well

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
scientists got together and said well

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:43.799 
scientists got together and said well
you<00:00:43.059> know<00:00:43.089> we<00:00:43.239> should<00:00:43.330> probably<00:00:43.479> figure<00:00:43.690> out

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
you know we should probably figure out

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:44.910 
you know we should probably figure out
which<00:00:43.930> ones<00:00:44.110> are<00:00:44.229> the<00:00:44.290> best<00:00:44.320> for<00:00:44.619> human

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
which ones are the best for human

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.310 
which ones are the best for human
consumption<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.760> out<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.690> those<00:00:46.839> i<00:00:46.900> narrowed

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
consumption and out of those i narrowed

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.689 
consumption and out of those i narrowed
it<00:00:47.409> down<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.559> four<00:00:47.979> and<00:00:48.280> then<00:00:48.430> out<00:00:48.549> of<00:00:48.580> those

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
it down to four and then out of those

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:49.799 
it down to four and then out of those
four<00:00:48.970> they<00:00:49.119> said<00:00:49.269> well<00:00:49.360> let's<00:00:49.510> go<00:00:49.600> with<00:00:49.720> this

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
four they said well let's go with this

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.619 
four they said well let's go with this
one<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.640> now<00:00:51.760> we're<00:00:51.909> down<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.059> that<00:00:52.269> one<00:00:52.449> which

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
one so now we're down to that one which

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.990 
one so now we're down to that one which
is<00:00:52.780> probably<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.379> basic<00:00:54.100> form<00:00:54.400> of<00:00:54.580> life<00:00:54.790> on

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
is probably the basic form of life on

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.850 
is probably the basic form of life on
the<00:00:55.059> whole<00:00:55.150> planet<00:00:55.269> it's<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.140> basic<00:00:56.500> form<00:00:56.769> of

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
the whole planet it's a basic form of

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.399 
the whole planet it's a basic form of

chlorophyll on the whole earth and that
basic<00:01:00.129> form<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.549> life<00:01:00.930> contains<00:01:01.930> something

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
basic form of life contains something

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.799 
basic form of life contains something
that<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.640> ourselves<00:01:03.760> identify<00:01:04.750> know

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
that that ourselves identify know

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.500 
that that ourselves identify know
exactly<00:01:05.379> what<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:05.770> but<00:01:06.250> we<00:01:06.460> cannot<00:01:07.000> get<00:01:07.360> it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
exactly what it is but we cannot get it

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.090 
exactly what it is but we cannot get it
from<00:01:07.689> any<00:01:07.930> other<00:01:08.140> food<00:01:08.409> except<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.830> very

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
from any other food except the very

basic forms of life on Earth and that
something<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:12.210> everything<00:01:13.500> here's<00:01:14.500> what<00:01:14.679> it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
something is everything here's what it

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.899 
something is everything here's what it
is<00:01:14.920> did<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.909> know<00:01:16.119> that<00:01:16.390> when<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.570> eat<00:01:16.929> food

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is did you know that when you eat food

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.330 
is did you know that when you eat food
you're<00:01:18.909> actually<00:01:19.119> like<00:01:19.929> eating<00:01:20.350> British

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
you're actually like eating British

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.179 
you're actually like eating British
pounds<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.329> pun<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:22.719> intended<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.829> convert

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
pounds that pun is intended and convert

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.880 
pounds that pun is intended and convert
it<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:25.600> you're<00:01:25.780> eating<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:26.109> currency<00:01:26.710> where

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
it like you're eating a currency where

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.840 
it like you're eating a currency where
your<00:01:27.009> body<00:01:27.159> goes<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.429> don't<00:01:27.490> even<00:01:27.640> know<00:01:27.759> what

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
your body goes you don't even know what

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.779 
your body goes you don't even know what
this<00:01:27.999> is<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:29.170> has<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.499> then<00:01:29.649> convert<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.429> over

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
this is it has to then convert it over

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.359 
this is it has to then convert it over
to<00:01:31.119> US<00:01:31.450> dollars<00:01:31.749> to<00:01:32.469> actually<00:01:32.710> become<00:01:32.950> energy

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
to US dollars to actually become energy

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.050 
to US dollars to actually become energy
and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.079> mitochondria<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.100> that's

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
and that's the mitochondria and that's

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.149 
and that's the mitochondria and that's
the<00:01:37.299> kreb<00:01:37.840> cycle<00:01:37.869> we've<00:01:38.619> all<00:01:38.799> heard<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.039> that

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the kreb cycle we've all heard of that

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.160 
the kreb cycle we've all heard of that
if<00:01:39.399> we<00:01:39.549> study<00:01:39.759> nutrition<00:01:40.030> we<00:01:40.749> found<00:01:40.899> out<00:01:41.109> that

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
if we study nutrition we found out that

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.349 
if we study nutrition we found out that
actually<00:01:41.619> when<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:41.799> digest<00:01:42.039> food<00:01:42.429> your<00:01:42.969> cells

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
actually when you digest food your cells

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.569 
actually when you digest food your cells
have<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.749> take<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.170> raw<00:01:44.499> proteins<00:01:45.009> has<00:01:45.249> to<00:01:45.399> take

have to take in raw proteins has to take

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.609

in the raw materials the fats oils and

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.889 
in the raw materials the fats oils and
carbohydrates<00:01:48.219> and<00:01:48.479> convert<00:01:49.479> them<00:01:49.509> into

so<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:11.880> have<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> actually<00:02:12.300> convert<00:02:12.930> over<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
so we have to actually convert over to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.540 
so we have to actually convert over to
that<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:13.500> those<00:02:13.710> are<00:02:13.830> called<00:02:13.950> nucleotides

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that so those are called nucleotides

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.400 
that so those are called nucleotides
we're<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.330> simplify<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.110> call<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
we're going to simplify it just call it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.870 
we're going to simplify it just call it
all<00:02:16.530> ATP<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.610> simple

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
all ATP because that's just simple

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.250 
all ATP because that's just simple
because<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.150> probably<00:02:18.360> remember<00:02:18.810> ATP

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
because we probably remember ATP

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.380 
because we probably remember ATP
somewhere<00:02:19.680> back<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.280> ninth<00:02:21.030> grade

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
somewhere back in like ninth grade

somewhere back in like ninth grade
somewhere<00:02:22.080> college<00:02:22.530> maybe<00:02:22.800> something<00:02:23.930> that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
somewhere college maybe something that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.270

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
when you take in marine phytoplankton

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.420 
when you take in marine phytoplankton
your<00:02:27.000> body<00:02:27.180> goes<00:02:27.620> we<00:02:28.620> know<00:02:28.770> what<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.250> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
your body goes we know what that is and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.980 
your body goes we know what that is and
it's<00:02:29.520> instant<00:02:29.970> energy<00:02:30.060> within<00:02:30.420> five<00:02:30.720> minutes

it's instant energy within five minutes

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.870 
it's instant energy within five minutes
it<00:02:31.620> goes<00:02:31.770> right<00:02:32.070> through<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.400> skin<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.760> goes

it goes right through your skin it goes

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.220 
it goes right through your skin it goes
right<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.180> your<00:02:33.270> body<00:02:33.480> right<00:02:33.600> there<00:02:33.990> five
