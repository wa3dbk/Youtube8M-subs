and in this segment we're gonna learn

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.110 
and in this segment we're gonna learn
about<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.480> build<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:07.109> raised<00:00:07.410> bed<00:00:08.120> now

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
about how to build a raised bed now

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.669 
about how to build a raised bed now
there's<00:00:09.330> lots<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.780> different<00:00:10.110> ways<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.559> build

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
there's lots of different ways to build

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.950 
there's lots of different ways to build
a<00:00:10.860> raised<00:00:11.010> bed<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.820> probably<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.300> easiest

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
a raised bed but probably the easiest

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.079 
a raised bed but probably the easiest
way<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:14.070> found<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.519> build<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.849> raised

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
way that I have found to build a raised

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.680 
way that I have found to build a raised
bed<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.350> lay<00:00:16.529> some<00:00:16.590> wood<00:00:17.190> out<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
bed is to just lay some wood out in a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.580 
bed is to just lay some wood out in a
big<00:00:18.869> square<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.580> fill<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> with<00:00:20.730> some<00:00:21.029> compost

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
big square and fill it with some compost

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.700 
big square and fill it with some compost
and<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.710> always<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:24.019> weed<00:00:25.019> barrier<00:00:25.350> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and I always use some weed barrier on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.620 
and I always use some weed barrier on
the<00:00:25.740> bottom<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> water<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.449> go

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the bottom that so the water can go

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
the bottom that so the water can go
through<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> weeds<00:00:28.890> don't<00:00:29.130> grow<00:00:29.220> up

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
through it but the weeds don't grow up

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.810 
through it but the weeds don't grow up
through<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.560> Gophers<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.579> moles

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
through it and the Gophers and the moles

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.370 
through it and the Gophers and the moles
don't<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.239> through<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> either<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> works

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
don't get through it either so it works

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950 
don't get through it either so it works
really<00:00:34.680> well<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.550> I'll<00:00:36.180> show<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.690> here

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
really well and I'll show you right here

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.229 
really well and I'll show you right here
what<00:00:37.200> I've<00:00:37.320> done<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> these<00:00:38.670> aren't<00:00:38.969> even

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
what I've done so these aren't even

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.760 
what I've done so these aren't even
connected<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:39.870> pieces<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.440> wood<00:00:40.620> we've

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
connected these pieces of wood we've

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.670 
connected these pieces of wood we've
just<00:00:41.040> got<00:00:41.570> probably<00:00:42.570> 8<00:00:42.750> feet<00:00:42.780> long<00:00:43.320> pieces

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
just got probably 8 feet long pieces

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.479 
just got probably 8 feet long pieces
I've<00:00:44.190> got<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:45.149> H<00:00:45.360> by<00:00:45.780> 2<00:00:45.809> 4<00:00:46.469> feet<00:00:46.739> pieces<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I've got to H by 2 4 feet pieces and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.029 
I've got to H by 2 4 feet pieces and
they<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.420> fit<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:48.899> well<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.680> put

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
they just fit really well and I just put

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
they just fit really well and I just put
them<00:00:50.160> into<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.430> big<00:00:50.640> rectangle<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.899> I've<00:00:52.050> got

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
them into a big rectangle and I've got

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
them into a big rectangle and I've got
my<00:00:52.410> weed<00:00:52.649> barrier<00:00:52.980> cloth<00:00:53.430> underneath<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
my weed barrier cloth underneath and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.799 
my weed barrier cloth underneath and
then<00:00:55.410> we've<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.070> put<00:00:56.309> lots<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.120> compost<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
then we've just put lots of compost in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.740 
then we've just put lots of compost in
here<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.440> filled<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.879> least<00:01:00.149> 4<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.600> 5

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
here and filled it up to at least 4 or 5

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
here and filled it up to at least 4 or 5
inches<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.379> we've<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.070> dug<00:01:02.579> down<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
inches and we've actually dug down a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.780 
inches and we've actually dug down a
little<00:01:03.300> bit<00:01:03.420> deeper<00:01:03.629> than<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.890> level<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
little bit deeper than the level of the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.870 
little bit deeper than the level of the
gravel<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.350> bed<00:01:07.560> itself<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.159> probably<00:01:08.580> six

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
gravel so the bed itself is probably six

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
gravel so the bed itself is probably six
inches<00:01:09.180> deep<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.659> we've<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.140> dug<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.710> out

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
inches deep so we've actually dug it out

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
inches deep so we've actually dug it out
a<00:01:10.860> little<00:01:11.100> bit<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.549> then<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
a little bit because then that we have a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.730 
a little bit because then that we have a
little<00:01:12.450> more<00:01:12.630> room<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.200> roots<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.619> grow

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
little more room for the roots to grow

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.630 
little more room for the roots to grow
and<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:15.150> bed<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.140> some<00:01:16.380> nice<00:01:16.640> lush

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and for the bed to have some nice lush

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.929 
and for the bed to have some nice lush
dirt<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:20.009> simple<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.759> do

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
dirt in it and it's really simple to do

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
dirt in it and it's really simple to do
and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.540> build<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.869> raised<00:01:22.020> bed<00:01:22.049> pretty

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and you can build a raised bed pretty

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.039 
and you can build a raised bed pretty
much<00:01:22.890> anywhere<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.610> don't<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.869> have

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
much anywhere you don't have to have

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.920 
much anywhere you don't have to have
wood<00:01:25.950> even<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.580> could<00:01:26.759> surround<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.479> by<00:01:27.630> rocks

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
wood even you could surround it by rocks

will sell rocks and landscape companies

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.890 
will sell rocks and landscape companies
and<00:01:32.490> even<00:01:32.579> gravel<00:01:33.180> pits<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> live
