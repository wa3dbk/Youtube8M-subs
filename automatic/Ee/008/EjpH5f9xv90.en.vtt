I<00:03:01.709> actually<00:03:02.010> didn't<00:03:02.430> think<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.730> could

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
I actually didn't think that you could

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.009 
I actually didn't think that you could
actually<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.239> without<00:03:03.540> that

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
actually do this without that

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.460 
actually do this without that
workstation<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:06.360> workstation<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:07.200> too

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
workstation and that workstation was too

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.670 
workstation and that workstation was too
much<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.860> pain<00:03:08.099> in<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.250> butt<00:03:08.519> for<00:03:08.760> me<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
much of a pain in the butt for me and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.080 
much of a pain in the butt for me and
this<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.920> was<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> lie<00:03:11.550> easier<00:03:13.640> I'm<00:03:14.640> not<00:03:14.819> sure

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
this just was a lie easier I'm not sure

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.860 
this just was a lie easier I'm not sure
if<00:03:15.209> all<00:03:15.420> computers<00:03:15.930> will<00:03:16.080> do<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.440> I'm<00:03:17.870> 99%

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
if all computers will do this I'm 99%

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.820 
if all computers will do this I'm 99%
sure<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:20.040> all<00:03:20.640> computers<00:03:21.180> will<00:03:21.299> do<00:03:21.450> this

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
sure that all computers will do this

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.220 
sure that all computers will do this
because<00:03:22.830> mine's<00:03:23.190> not<00:03:23.430> new<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:24.480> not<00:03:24.720> new<00:03:24.959> but
