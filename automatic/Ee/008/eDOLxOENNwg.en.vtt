etc now I'm just going to go through a
little<00:03:03.350> bit<00:03:03.560> about<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.100> software

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
little bit about this software

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.760 
little bit about this software
unfortunately<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.200> cannot<00:03:06.560> show<00:03:06.740> you

everything<00:03:07.400> because<00:03:07.550> now<00:03:07.910> I'm<00:03:08.000> using<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.360> to

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
everything because now I'm using it to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.020 
everything because now I'm using it to
capture<00:03:08.960> and<00:03:09.140> when<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.280> capturing<00:03:10.910> you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
capture and when it's capturing you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.060 
capture and when it's capturing you
cannot<00:03:11.300> access<00:03:11.750> some<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.140> these<00:03:12.290> settings<00:03:12.830> and

cannot access some of these settings and
options<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.660> will<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.530> briefly<00:03:15.710> describe

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
options so I will just briefly describe

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.699 
options so I will just briefly describe
and<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.760> should<00:03:16.940> get<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.120> quick<00:03:17.780> idea<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.590> now

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
and you should get a quick idea so now

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.370 
and you should get a quick idea so now
the<00:03:18.770> interface<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.430> very<00:03:19.640> clean<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.380> you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
the interface is very clean and you

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.670 
the interface is very clean and you
should<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.860> very<00:03:22.280> familiar<00:03:23.239> with<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.170> you

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
should be very familiar with it if you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
should be very familiar with it if you
use<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:24.980> showpiece<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.700> very<00:03:26.660> similar<00:03:27.700> Joby's

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
use the showpiece is very similar Joby's

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.729 
use the showpiece is very similar Joby's
has<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.450> screen<00:03:29.870> as<00:03:30.020> well<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.350> preview

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
has this screen as well the preview

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.290 
has this screen as well the preview
screen<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:31.400> some<00:03:31.640> options<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
screen and then some options and the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.240 
screen and then some options and the
record<00:03:32.660> buttons<00:03:33.050> at<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.230> bottom<00:03:33.770> I<00:03:33.920> believe

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
record buttons at the bottom I believe

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.050 
record buttons at the bottom I believe
and<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.989> has<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.410> here<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.550> you<00:03:37.580> can

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
and this it has it here so you can

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.699 
and this it has it here so you can
select<00:03:38.239> from<00:03:38.480> different<00:03:38.900> capture<00:03:39.080> cuts<00:03:39.470> I

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
select from different capture cuts I

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.990 
select from different capture cuts I
believe<00:03:40.190> if<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.370> plugged<00:03:40.730> in<00:03:40.940> your<00:03:41.300> HD<00:03:42.200> PVR

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
believe if you plugged in your HD PVR

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.060 
believe if you plugged in your HD PVR
devices<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.269> will<00:03:44.360> show<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.959> there<00:03:45.260> for<00:03:45.890> me<00:03:46.040> I

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
devices it will show it there for me I

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.240 
devices it will show it there for me I
have<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.610> PCIe<00:03:47.060> cuts<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.840> iPod<00:03:48.140> closes<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.130> it

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
have the PCIe cuts the iPod closes so it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.360 
have the PCIe cuts the iPod closes so it
detected<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.090> then<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:50.840> can<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.800> these

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
detected it and then you can and these

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.660 
detected it and then you can and these
are<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.640> file<00:03:52.880> name<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.660> video<00:03:54.530> input<00:03:54.950> as<00:03:55.190> per

usual you can select from the different

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.660 
usual you can select from the different
component<00:03:58.160> or<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.760> want<00:03:58.940> HDMI<00:03:59.510> or<00:03:59.780> composite

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
etc audio input as well now the next

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.240 
etc audio input as well now the next
thing<00:04:03.980> here<00:04:04.160> this<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.670> very<00:04:05.120> very<00:04:05.390> interesting

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
thing here this is very very interesting

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.280 
thing here this is very very interesting
it<00:04:07.250> does<00:04:07.550> not<00:04:07.790> work<00:04:08.060> for<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.480> hop-up<00:04:08.750> kaluza's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
it does not work for the hop-up kaluza's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.320 
it does not work for the hop-up kaluza's
I<00:04:09.440> don't<00:04:09.830> believe<00:04:10.100> it<00:04:10.250> works<00:04:10.489> for<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.850> HD<00:04:11.120> PVR

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
I don't believe it works for the HD PVR

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.350 
I don't believe it works for the HD PVR
one<00:04:11.930> as<00:04:12.140> well<00:04:12.380> but<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.670> thing<00:04:13.970> here<00:04:14.209> is

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
one as well but this thing here is

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.580 
one as well but this thing here is
likely<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.780> mixer<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:16.190> allows<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.390> mix<00:04:18.230> your

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
likely a mixer it allows you to mix your

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
a little bit more about using

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.879 
a little bit more about using
what<00:04:25.999> here<00:04:26.509> or<00:04:26.659> something<00:04:26.930> like<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:27.199> to

wan your in-game sounds to be etc so
this<00:05:03.860> is<00:05:04.039> absolutely<00:05:04.219> amazing

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
this is absolutely amazing

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.749 
this is absolutely amazing
unfortunately<00:05:06.439> I<00:05:06.469> tried<00:05:06.889> for<00:05:07.069> the<00:05:07.159> closest

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
unfortunately I tried for the closest

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.749 
unfortunately I tried for the closest
and<00:05:07.969> all<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.199> does<00:05:09.409> is<00:05:09.650> clip<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.159> audio<00:05:10.340> and

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
and all it does is clip the audio and

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.559 
and all it does is clip the audio and
the<00:05:10.879> whole<00:05:11.120> video<00:05:11.360> stutters<00:05:12.319> and<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:13.129> just

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
the whole video stutters and it just

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.929 
the whole video stutters and it just
doesn't<00:05:14.569> work<00:05:14.750> for<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.560> closest<00:05:16.129> so<00:05:16.699> that's

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:16.939 
doesn't work for the closest so that's

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.909 
doesn't work for the closest so that's
just<00:05:17.180> something<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.539> take<00:05:17.779> that<00:05:17.990> off<00:05:18.110> now

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
just something to take that off now

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.129 
just something to take that off now
another<00:05:19.430> thing<00:05:19.639> here<00:05:19.789> we<00:05:19.939> have<00:05:20.089> is<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.509> video

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
another thing here we have is the video

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.679 
another thing here we have is the video
quality<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:22.460> should<00:05:22.639> know<00:05:22.789> about<00:05:22.819> this<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.539> I

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
quality you should know about this and I

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.649 
quality you should know about this and I
don't<00:05:23.870> have<00:05:23.990> variable<00:05:24.439> constant<00:05:25.089> so<00:05:26.089> you<00:05:26.150> just

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
don't have variable constant so you just

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.439 
don't have variable constant so you just
hover<00:05:27.050> around<00:05:27.319> this<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:28.009> bit<00:05:28.610> rate<00:05:28.879> that<00:05:29.150> you

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
hover around this a bit rate that you

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.779 
hover around this a bit rate that you
record<00:05:29.810> obviously<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.680> higher<00:05:30.919> s<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.550> higher

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
record obviously the higher s the higher

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.089 
record obviously the higher s the higher
the<00:05:31.969> quality<00:05:32.270> but<00:05:32.900> obviously<00:05:33.259> your<00:05:33.500> file<00:05:33.800> size

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
the quality but obviously your file size

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.300 
the quality but obviously your file size
is<00:05:34.310> going<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.550> be<00:05:34.669> much<00:05:34.939> larger<00:05:35.810> as<00:05:36.020> well<00:05:36.409> now

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310
