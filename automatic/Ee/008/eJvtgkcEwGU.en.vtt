00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so the predictions need to be the result

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.350 
so the predictions need to be the result
the<00:00:52.170> score<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> who<00:00:53.010> scores<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.610> closest

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the score and who scores the closest

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
the score and who scores the closest

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
get a balance point i was going to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
get a balance point i was going to
overcomplicate<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> point<00:01:00.030> system

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
overcomplicate it with a point system

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.110 
overcomplicate it with a point system
for<00:01:00.649> 1.4<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.920> correct<00:01:02.190> results<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.969> other
