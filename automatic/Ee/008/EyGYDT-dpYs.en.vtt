00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.830
 and so continue to start bookmark 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.599
 insulation shown to this wall as 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.220
 more complex with window openings 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:24.410
 somewhere already wider 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:29.739
 and so can be repeated but more convenient 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.180
 of course if you come here and bars you either 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.879
 horizontally they are vertically insulated 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:41.170
 then it would not be necessary to cut or 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:47.839
 find insulation in increments of 40 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:55.000
 centimeters but in the form of building 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:01:03.739
 markets go 600 millimeters wide and so 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.990
 laying still would like maybe 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.820
 on Munich to help and only then I 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 figured out between window openings here 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.210
 the lace was killed below 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:23.330
 then I started doing rake like this 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:26.990
 here this given fill the battery so 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:32.090
 it was easier to break a bar of this 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.710
 the case of this board 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.100
 respectively positive and also 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.530
 then I started stuffing big ones 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.860
 bars in the same way 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.800
 top middle 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.580
 The lace was also packed here for me 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.520
 relief 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.920
 I represented the bar below the lace here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.180
 I tied up with a self-tapping screw 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.670
 put up below and how would the bar stand 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.210
 can be mounted one way 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.110
 that for some days I was getting out what i 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.509
 worked alone this is true we will 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:16.300
 I will interfere with the transfer of an electrician already 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:24.100
 caused like this well something will be 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:29.820
 will be added like this 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.820
 that's the way it all goes with us 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 the sample is that we get everything and 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.070
 Anton you're here, too, will be remade 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.200
 looked conferred and decided that not 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.160
 it looks it all will remain 1 and the mouse 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:07.650
 piracy will continue too 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.650
 redoing something like this
