00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.130
 as you well say for a hundred the music and the substances that are used for 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.760
 alter our states of consciousness 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.299
 per cent have been associated for a long time 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.360
 I want to imagine some caves 30 thousand years ago when the man was just 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:14.149
 man 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:18.579
 and recently it was discovered that they allow or some kind of plants there was an elixir 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.069
 that made us some changes in the way we feel about thinking 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.069
 surely that company with some drums not inside these 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.640
 and surely 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.460
 to go see a concert of paganini cd the people had konÃ© aquilino previous 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.530
 to this not 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.580
 they also deny 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.380
 Yeah sure 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.290
 the hand and there are many 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.890
 the examples that come to mind 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.220
 cn the rastafari community for example that is very much with the king and stuccos 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 traditionally are cannabis users 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.930
 some of these dark times of the disk and everything else that drove 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.199
 we call all these people very strawberry 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.699
 I know I declared cocaine use for example so important that there was in 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:56.460
 that time 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.230
 And the examples are many, even 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.310
 the Huicholes 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.780
 pilgrimage eating 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.780
 Mescaline will surely accompany him with flutes and some other way 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.030
 musical and good the temples because they are many sheen certainly be 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.079
 seen an association between all this type of substances that has been given by 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:14.780
 call law 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.330
 'designer drugs' 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 and the environment king 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.980
 or the atmosphere of club music with electro mika music 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.750
 but I would like to be very yee clear in making see 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.600
 that not all the people who go to reixa 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.149
 consume substances 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.729
 and not everyone who uses ecstasy for example go to reixa is an association that 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.950
 can give but not causally 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.860
 then percent and as you said apart from the information and the part of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 to know 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 is what these substances are for where they come from what damage can cause 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.320
 they are a very important part 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.210
 let's say 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.610
 something that young people have to know especially if they choose 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.170
 by their own will 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.200
 to use any of these substances but nothing for example 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520
 right now we have understood in the big media 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.180
 the communication that if there is a 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.480
 strange little information is not clear it is not and yes very amarillista 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.450
 hites is a guy who wants what is good as you say there are those who can 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.349
 have a relationship with this 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.879
 and that I do not necessarily have to be a problem so we get a point in 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.260
 that is already a problem but if there is someone who already has a problem with the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.159
 consumption 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.439
 client where can they turn 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.129
 look at you I think that is one of the weak legs of our system 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.859
 certainly there are some institutions like the centers of 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.719
 youth integration the national institute of psychiatry where I 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.100
 work and many others 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.779
 yes in a set it is about giving you some 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.519
 asks for help to the areas that have detected a problem regarding the consumption of 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.379
 substances employment I think that today we could avoid breaking the 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.519
 circle where are we the most facial or macro 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.269
 and think that this has to do 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.290
 because of the policy that leads mexico regarding the issues 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.569
 related to drugs happens what the northern country tells us 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.619
 and many other things where we are making decisions that may not be 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.549
 attached to the scientific part or the real part 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.989
 but rather they have other mobiles and this must open up a lot 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.289
 to the discussion 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.059
 percent because if there are places to be served 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.389
 I summon the people that were living us of guardianship auditorium that if 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.969
 there is some problem that requires handling of this type swear by attention 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.219
 but at the same time from my point of view we are spending a lot more money 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.090
 in the border patrol and in prisons and all this 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.130
 what about people who need medical treatment 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.150
 we must invest that money in a different way because as you say 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.169
 in many people 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.229
 that they may have some sporadic contact or that in a way 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:39.719
 recreational 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.269
 they come to get in touch with a substance 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.249
 the way maybe I can not drink a beer 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.249
 without having a major problem this is also true 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.840
 for example that since in relation to the duel with the festival that has good 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:54.289
 some some 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:58.159
 problems of being performed as the cancer was performed two years 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.429
 I think there is also a prejudice 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.949
 on the part of the authorities with respect to that would also be addressed 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.309
 relate this this guy this ex presidents musical pressure 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.539
 with consumption i 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.840
 I know that none of the violence, I feel there is a lack of knowledge 

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.919
 on the part of the authorities with their young people with the young people of this city 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.879
 you think that salt lend enough information about 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.330
 I do not think so 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.559
 and I think it's very serious 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.020
 and I think we do opt for the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.319
 police or persecutory option for all our problems the hard hand 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.479
 we will also have to close secondary schools because in any 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.759
 secondary then get a crack stone 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.620
 marijuana municipality or whatever you want 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.750
 everything is the problem 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.870
 as I usually say many times 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.010
 it does not have as much to do with substances because the substance is 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.880
 inert objects that have no will and that do not harm anyone the problem 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.110
 is the one who consumes it 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.110
 in a pathological way here the society in which it develops 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.050
 percent 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.870
 I do with mining these authorities to come with more in detail this 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.180
 and what my partner commented his moment 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.490
 how good in a party america chivas 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.789
 Without a doubt 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.870
 there are going to be more more beaten dead 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.809
 flaxseed vandalism 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:22.069
 that in a concert like these you get any of these six maybe 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.659
 around the world by the way 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.939
 and where most people do not want to talk about all they go with a 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.050
 spirit of having fun and dancing 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.469
 and this 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.520
 and being young not sure 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.629
 many of the kids who detonate in the raids are children of the hippies of the 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.139
 sixties 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.420
 clancy than his grandparents 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.600
 hallucinates go because we love it to the miniskirt or because I'm going to give 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.650
 music of rolling stones with generic kimi 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.940
 because today we are also seeing this part of the generation gap 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.669
 clancy and how the paradigm of 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.129
 let's say this the age in power or the age group in power that in this 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.580
 Our parents are no longer us 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.229
 well it's a pretty issue this killock stamp I hope we continue 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:03.880
 having 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.000
 this space and that we are talking with you are our companions 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.020
 this office and thank you very much we congratulate a court interested
