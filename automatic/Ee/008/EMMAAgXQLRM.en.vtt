00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
hey it's probably a movie a lot of you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.240 
hey it's probably a movie a lot of you
haven't<00:00:32.430> heard<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.890> there's<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.040> lot

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
haven't heard about and be there's a lot

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.639 
haven't heard about and be there's a lot
of<00:00:35.370> similarities<00:00:35.940> between<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.079> Pacific

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
of similarities between it and Pacific

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.990 
of similarities between it and Pacific
Rim<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> Pacific<00:00:39.600> Rim<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.370> jaegers

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
Rim and Pacific Rim we see the jaegers

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
Rim and Pacific Rim we see the jaegers
which<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> name<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.960> big<00:00:43.530> robots<00:00:43.950> are

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
which is the name of the big robots are

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.869 
which is the name of the big robots are
being<00:00:44.550> controlled<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:45.559> two<00:00:46.559> pilots<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.430> Galen

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
being controlled by two pilots and Galen

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.840 
being controlled by two pilots and Galen
Turturro<00:00:48.239> has<00:00:48.539> said<00:00:49.370> that<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.700> reason

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
Turturro has said that the reason

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.310 
Turturro has said that the reason
there's<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.180> pilots<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:51.809> each<00:00:51.989> pilot

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
there's two pilots is because each pilot

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.819 
there's two pilots is because each pilot
controls<00:00:52.820> one<00:00:53.820> hemisphere<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> brain<00:00:54.829> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
controls one hemisphere of the brain and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.729 
controls one hemisphere of the brain and
so<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.160> pilots<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:57.270> halves<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> brain<00:00:57.739> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so two pilots two halves of the brain so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
so two pilots two halves of the brain so
in<00:00:59.250> robot<00:01:00.000> Jack's<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:01.850> probably<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.149> budget

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
in robot Jack's it's probably for budget

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
in robot Jack's it's probably for budget
reasons<00:01:03.739> there's<00:01:04.739> only<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.159> pilot

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
reasons there's only one pilot

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
reasons there's only one pilot
controlling<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.600> giant<00:01:07.110> mech<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.210> just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
controlling the giant mech but it's just

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.630 
controlling the giant mech but it's just
really<00:01:09.570> cool<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.619> someone<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.100> me<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.280> grow

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
really cool for someone like me to grow

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
really cool for someone like me to grow
up<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.850> movies<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.619> after<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> robot

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
up with movies like this after a robot

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.190 
up with movies like this after a robot
chucks<00:01:14.189> came<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.850> lot<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> direct-to-video

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
chucks came out a lot of direct-to-video

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
chucks came out a lot of direct-to-video
movies<00:01:16.830> came<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.600> robots<00:01:18.600> either

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
movies came out with robots either

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.170 
movies came out with robots either

the robot portions of the movie if you

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.059 
the robot portions of the movie if you

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
could cut out every

could cut out every
thing<00:02:12.249> with<00:02:12.519> Shia<00:02:12.939> LeBouf<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:14.129> basically<00:02:15.129> all

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:15.249 
thing with Shia LeBouf and basically all

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:19.229

the<00:02:15.370> human<00:02:15.780> parts<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.959> movies<00:02:17.290> out<00:02:18.239> those

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
the human parts of the movies out those

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.349 
the human parts of the movies out those
movies<00:02:19.540> would<00:02:19.629> be<00:02:19.689> a<00:02:20.189> lot<00:02:21.189> better<00:02:21.400> they

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
movies would be a lot better they

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.459 
movies would be a lot better they
wouldn't<00:02:22.629> be<00:02:22.689> perfect<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.230> there's

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
wouldn't be perfect because there's

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.039 
wouldn't be perfect because there's
still<00:02:23.650> some<00:02:23.889> cheesy<00:02:24.879> parts<00:02:25.299> that<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.810> could
