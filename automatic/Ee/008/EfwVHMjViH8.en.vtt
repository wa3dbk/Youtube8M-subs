as<00:00:27.560> well<00:00:27.700> and<00:00:28.700> we'll<00:00:28.910> be<00:00:29.060> doing<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.480> easy

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
as well and we'll be doing the easy

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.359 
as well and we'll be doing the easy
b-tree<00:00:30.200> function<00:00:30.710> which<00:00:30.829> allows<00:00:31.099> you<00:00:31.340> to

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
b-tree function which allows you to

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.220 
b-tree function which allows you to
retrieve<00:00:31.910> a<00:00:32.029> controller's<00:00:32.660> memory<00:00:33.020> that<00:00:33.170> was

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
retrieve a controller's memory that was

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.950 
retrieve a controller's memory that was
preset<00:00:33.710> from<00:00:33.920> before<00:00:34.390> well<00:00:35.390> walk<00:00:35.630> you<00:00:35.780> through

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
how to do a test program as well we'll

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.750 
how to do a test program as well we'll
be<00:00:38.360> doing<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.050> reset<00:00:39.440> procedure<00:00:39.710> for<00:00:40.430> all<00:00:40.670> the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
be doing the reset procedure for all the

be doing the reset procedure for all the
different<00:00:41.000> functions<00:00:41.149> of<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.540> controller

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
different functions of the controller

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.100 
different functions of the controller
and<00:00:42.760> we'll<00:00:43.760> talk<00:00:44.030> about<00:00:44.300> setting<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.690> station

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
and we'll talk about setting the station

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.200 
and we'll talk about setting the station
names<00:00:45.290> as<00:00:45.560> well<00:00:45.800> as<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.070> program<00:00:46.460> names<00:00:46.730> and
