around<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.950> they<00:02:47.400> were<00:02:47.460> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.880> take<00:02:48.360> if

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
around that they were going to take if

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.510 
around that they were going to take if
it<00:02:49.170> was<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.500> Tampa<00:02:49.800> Bay<00:02:49.830> Lightning<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it was the Tampa Bay Lightning that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.370 
it was the Tampa Bay Lightning that
would<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.820> won<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.240> Stanley<00:02:51.570> Cup<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
would have won the Stanley Cup the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.350 
would have won the Stanley Cup the
speculation<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.490> they<00:02:53.670> would<00:02:53.850> have<00:02:53.970> done<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
speculation is they would have done the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.650 
speculation is they would have done the
exact<00:02:54.780> same<00:02:54.810> cover<00:02:55.230> with<00:02:55.470> two<00:02:56.390> athletes<00:02:57.390> on

exact same cover with two athletes on
the<00:02:57.720> Tampa<00:02:58.260> Bay<00:02:58.290> cover<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.920> cover<00:02:59.610> as<00:02:59.880> well<00:03:00.240> so

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the Tampa Bay cover as cover as well so

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.450 
the Tampa Bay cover as cover as well so
whether<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.870> would<00:03:00.960> been<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.410> Stamkos<00:03:02.280> at

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
whether it would been like Stamkos at
