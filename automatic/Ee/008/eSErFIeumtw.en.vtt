00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 Here it was decided that I would go 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.170
 because we wanted to go in four but 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.840
 decided not to spend a large amount on 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.440
 tickets because it was getting to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.980

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 in-house funds at matches 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.640

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.579
 there was a cry among fans that everybody 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.450
 the match is worth the person near the sector with 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:42.659

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:46.020

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.060
 left 500 someone who became what I could 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.710

 most three children and you know it so 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.810
 today it is generally hard 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.990
 difficult after all moms who threw 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.030
 Ukraine as social benefits which they 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.790
 got what they expected 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.650
 and today they are forgotten 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.300
 the fact that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.890
 Donetsk republic helps it understandably 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.210
 it's still missing because 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.220
 many mommies who get today 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.810
 monetary assistance they live in hostels 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:33.070
 that is, it 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.670

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.180
 here many in general live only in 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.140
 the hostel has nowhere to stay and even 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.910
 apartment removal that is, it turns out that 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.040
 this 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.150
