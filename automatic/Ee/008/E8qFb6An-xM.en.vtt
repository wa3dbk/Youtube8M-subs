this<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:03.990> my<00:00:04.140> tutorial<00:00:04.710> showing<00:00:04.950> how<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.250> solve

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
this is my tutorial showing how to solve

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.870 
this is my tutorial showing how to solve
their<00:00:06.089> best<00:00:06.390> as<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:07.140> titan<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.830> hard<00:00:08.429> mode<00:00:08.490> in

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
their best as a titan on hard mode in

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.360 
their best as a titan on hard mode in
the<00:00:09.030> crawl<00:00:09.269> rate<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.860> first<00:00:11.070> thing<00:00:11.190> will

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
the crawl rate so the first thing will

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.220 
the crawl rate so the first thing will
appear<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.910> screen<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> little<00:00:12.840> circle

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
appear on the screen is a little circle

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.740 
appear on the screen is a little circle
now<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.400> shown<00:00:14.730> how<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.240> weight<00:00:15.630> of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
now this is shown how the weight of

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.260 
now this is shown how the weight of
Darkness<00:00:16.199> gets<00:00:16.410> applied<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.010> unapplied<00:00:17.940> by

grenades just to my just going to push
them<00:00:49.140> away<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.579> run<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:53.090> then

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
them away bit more and a run up then

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.049 
them away bit more and a run up then
once<00:00:54.300> you're<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.809> it'll<00:00:55.020> lumps<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> need<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
once you're up it'll lumps you need to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.849 
once you're up it'll lumps you need to
detonate<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.680> all

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
detonate this one now this is all

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.750 
detonate this one now this is all
exactly<00:00:59.730> how<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:01.109> easy<00:01:01.440> mode

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
exactly how you would do it on easy mode

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.050 
exactly how you would do it on easy mode
there's<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:02.910> no<00:01:03.210> real<00:01:03.629> difference<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
there's really no real difference is

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.340 
there's really no real difference is
incredibly<00:01:06.060> simple<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> block<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.960> lamp

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
incredibly simple so you block that lamp

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.500 
incredibly simple so you block that lamp
you<00:01:10.799> want<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> activate<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> bridge<00:01:11.880> platform

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you want to activate the bridge platform

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.899 
you want to activate the bridge platform
now<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> deferent<00:01:13.799> serious<00:01:14.220> would<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.490> we

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
now the deferent serious would be we

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.520 
now the deferent serious would be we
can't<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.450> kill<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> organ<00:01:16.200> less<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
can't really kill the organ less you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
can't really kill the organ less you
have<00:01:16.710> some<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.070> amazing<00:01:17.549> weapons<00:01:17.939> you're

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
have some like amazing weapons you're

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.170 
have some like amazing weapons you're
going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.960> no<00:01:19.170> chance<00:01:19.580> but<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> use

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
going to have no chance but we can use

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.660 
going to have no chance but we can use
it's<00:01:21.570> our<00:01:21.780> bubble<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> our<00:01:23.040> bubble<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> stay

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it's our bubble and our bubble can stay

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's our bubble and our bubble can stay
up<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.150> long<00:01:24.450> enough<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:25.080> us<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.720> over

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
up just long enough for us to get over

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
up just long enough for us to get over
the<00:01:27.810> bridge<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> ore<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> turn

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the bridge so the ore is going to turn

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
the bridge so the ore is going to turn
up<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.140> best<00:01:31.470> against
