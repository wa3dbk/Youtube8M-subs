00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149 

I'm<00:00:00.780> primarily<00:00:01.050> behind<00:00:01.589> keyboard<00:00:02.040> I've

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
I'm primarily behind keyboard I've

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.619 
I'm primarily behind keyboard I've
gotten<00:00:02.490> questions<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.240> do<00:00:03.419> certain

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
gotten questions about how to do certain

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.869 
gotten questions about how to do certain
inputs<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.259> keyboard<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.670> talked<00:00:05.850> a

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
inputs on keyboard and we talked a

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.400 
inputs on keyboard and we talked a
little<00:00:06.089> bit<00:00:06.240> about<00:00:06.359> working<00:00:06.810> butts<00:00:07.049> are<00:00:07.200> hard

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
little bit about working butts are hard

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.570 
little bit about working butts are hard
to<00:00:07.529> do<00:00:09.230> how<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.260> do<00:00:10.500> them<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.769> what<00:00:11.160> makes<00:00:11.370> them

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
to do how to do them and what makes them

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.999 
to do how to do them and what makes them
hard

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
hard

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.820 
hard
first<00:00:14.009> off<00:00:14.219> tiger<00:00:15.150> named<00:00:15.330> moose<00:00:15.830> they're

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
first off tiger named moose they're

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.160 
first off tiger named moose they're
really<00:00:17.430> easy<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> keyboard<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:18.810> do

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
really easy on a keyboard you just do

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.820 
really easy on a keyboard you just do
them<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> motion<00:00:20.070> press<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
them do the motion press up so if you

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.700 
them do the motion press up so if you
ever<00:00:22.949> played<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.369> Don<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.000> keyboard<00:00:24.810> you're

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
ever played a Don on a keyboard you're

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.000 
ever played a Don on a keyboard you're
doing<00:00:26.039> his<00:00:26.160> Jaguar<00:00:26.430> cheese<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.090> hard<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
doing his Jaguar cheese is really hard a

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.910 
doing his Jaguar cheese is really hard a
normal<00:00:29.010> half<00:00:29.939> circle<00:00:30.359> motion<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.830> I'm

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
normal half circle motion like what I'm

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.600 
normal half circle motion like what I'm
doing<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.550> isn't<00:00:33.329> good<00:00:33.450> enough<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
doing here isn't good enough so the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.560 
doing here isn't good enough so the
trick<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.780> actual<00:00:37.079> input<00:00:37.230> requires<00:00:38.570> any

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
trick is the actual input requires any

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.180 
trick is the actual input requires any
forward<00:00:40.290> Direction<00:00:42.530> exactly<00:00:43.530> down<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
forward Direction exactly down and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.110 
forward Direction exactly down and
exactly<00:00:44.760> back<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.660> kick<00:00:46.129> you<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
exactly back and then kick you when you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
exactly back and then kick you when you
normally<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> motion<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> keyboard<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
normally do a motion on a keyboard you

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950 
normally do a motion on a keyboard you
end<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.340> where<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.210> down

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
end up with that where you go from down

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
end up with that where you go from down
forward<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.590> down<00:00:52.770> back<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.460> even<00:00:54.059> make<00:00:54.180> sure

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
forward you down back and even make sure

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.180 
forward you down back and even make sure
you<00:00:54.449> hit<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:55.050> without<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> forward<00:00:56.070> or

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you hit that down without the forward or

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.590 
you hit that down without the forward or
back<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:57.289> like<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> reason

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
back in the way like that so the reason

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.549 
back in the way like that so the reason
why<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:01.520> keyboard<00:01:02.520> buttons

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
why this is is because keyboard buttons

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.280 
why this is is because keyboard buttons
aren't<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.739> arcade<00:01:05.430> sticks<00:01:05.869> where<00:01:06.869> they're

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
aren't like arcade sticks where they're

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.950 
aren't like arcade sticks where they're
really<00:01:07.470> springy<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.909> press<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.479> kind

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
really springy when you press it it kind

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350 
really springy when you press it it kind
of<00:01:10.049> sticks<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> second<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
of sticks for a second you know you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.100 
of sticks for a second you know you
can't<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.750> mash<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.560> nearly<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.159> easily<00:01:15.110> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
can't really mash it nearly as easily so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.749 
can't really mash it nearly as easily so
it<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.560> end<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.830> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> having<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> slow

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it you end up kind of having to slow

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.240 
it you end up kind of having to slow
down<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> input<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.950> order<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
down the input a little bit in order to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.160 
down the input a little bit in order to
do<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.640> you're<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.150> suited<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> crouching

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
do it you're not suited from a crouching

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.060 
do it you're not suited from a crouching
you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.610> crouching<00:01:24.619> hold<00:01:25.619> forward

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you can just go crouching hold forward

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.030 
you can just go crouching hold forward
release<00:01:26.909> forward<00:01:27.390> press<00:01:28.049> back

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.590 

like<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:32.620> I<00:01:34.060> preferred<00:01:35.060> hunter<00:01:35.360> from<00:01:35.480> a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
like that I preferred hunter from a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.680 
like that I preferred hunter from a
standing<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:42.560> doing<00:01:42.800> a<00:01:42.890> 360<00:01:43.370> on<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.420> keyboard

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
standing so doing a 360 on a keyboard

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.930 
standing so doing a 360 on a keyboard
isn't<00:01:45.080> as<00:01:45.290> tricky<00:01:45.530> as<00:01:45.650> you<00:01:45.710> might<00:01:45.920> think<00:01:46.220> the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
isn't as tricky as you might think the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.300 
isn't as tricky as you might think the
only<00:01:47.180> problem<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.080> doing<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.890> as

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
only problem is is that doing this as

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.640 
only problem is is that doing this as
fast<00:01:50.180> as<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.540> can<00:01:50.750> use<00:01:51.050> doesn't<00:01:51.380> work<00:01:51.530> it

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
fast as you can use doesn't work it

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.710 
fast as you can use doesn't work it
works<00:01:51.830> there<00:01:52.070> but<00:01:52.670> normally<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.090> doesn't

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
works there but normally that doesn't

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.080 
works there but normally that doesn't
work<00:01:53.870> I<00:01:54.230> find<00:01:54.860> slowing<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.580> down<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.790> little<00:01:55.910> bit

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
work I find slowing it down a little bit

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.590 
work I find slowing it down a little bit
and<00:01:57.400> it's<00:01:58.400> basically<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:59.090> half<00:01:59.330> circle

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
and it's basically just a half circle

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.680 
and it's basically just a half circle
motion<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.290> up<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:01.280> works<00:02:01.490> fine<00:02:01.730> for<00:02:01.760> me<00:02:02.060> you

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
motion and up that works fine for me you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.370 
motion and up that works fine for me you
can<00:02:02.840> also<00:02:02.990> do<00:02:03.410> it

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
can also do it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.320 
can also do it
forward<00:02:06.380> back<00:02:06.620> down<00:02:06.979> up<00:02:07.220> or<00:02:08.200> any<00:02:09.200> combination

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
forward back down up or any combination

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.720 
forward back down up or any combination
and<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:12.200> wasn't<00:02:12.350> quick<00:02:12.560> enough<00:02:12.620> not<00:02:13.460> usually

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
and that wasn't quick enough not usually

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.520 
and that wasn't quick enough not usually
doing<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.090> way<00:02:14.150> any<00:02:14.750> combination<00:02:15.350> works

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
doing it that way any combination works

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.020 
doing it that way any combination works
basically<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.220> just<00:02:16.280> need<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.580> get<00:02:16.640> all<00:02:16.760> four

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
basically you just need to get all four

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.430 
basically you just need to get all four
directions<00:02:18.160> another<00:02:19.160> way<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.370> do<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:20.440> if

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
directions another way to do it is if

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.000 
directions another way to do it is if
you<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.190> call<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.270> spinning<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> stick<00:02:24.020> you

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
you I call this spinning the stick you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.120 
you I call this spinning the stick you
just<00:02:25.490> kind<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.300> put<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> finger<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.500> each<00:02:27.709> button

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
just kind of put a finger on each button

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.910 
just kind of put a finger on each button
and<00:02:28.340> mash<00:02:28.730> as<00:02:28.940> hard<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.300> can<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.920> with

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
and mash as hard as you can and with

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.190 
and mash as hard as you can and with
that<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.310> can<00:02:31.459> do<00:02:31.550> like<00:02:31.580> an<00:02:31.880> empty<00:02:32.090> jump<00:02:32.420> in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that you can do like an empty jump in

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.650 
that you can do like an empty jump in
just<00:02:33.350> 720<00:02:34.070> or<00:02:36.730> after<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> focused<00:02:38.120> attack<00:02:38.420> or

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
just 720 or after a focused attack or

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.330 
just 720 or after a focused attack or
trying<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.930> do<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.140> as<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.260> reversal<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.930> find<00:02:41.930> it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
trying to do it as a reversal I find it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.580 
trying to do it as a reversal I find it
easier<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.370> do<00:02:43.550> 720's<00:02:44.209> that<00:02:44.390> way<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.870> also

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
easier to do 720's that way are also

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.860 
easier to do 720's that way are also
just<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.550> want<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> do<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> reversal<00:02:47.390> SPD

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
just if you want to do a reversal SPD

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.580 
just if you want to do a reversal SPD
that's<00:02:48.800> easier<00:02:49.730> than<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.630> more<00:02:51.019> deliberate

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
that's easier than the more deliberate

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.290 
that's easier than the more deliberate
method<00:02:54.040> super<00:02:55.040> flash<00:02:55.310> kick<00:02:55.640> motions<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.239> be

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
method super flash kick motions can be

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.960 
method super flash kick motions can be
pretty<00:02:56.600> hard<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.840> do<00:02:56.989> on<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> keyboard<00:02:57.970> there

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
pretty hard to do on a keyboard there

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.940 
pretty hard to do on a keyboard there
are<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> few<00:02:59.209> tricks<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.690> can<00:02:59.720> do<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.560> basic

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
are a few tricks you can do the basic

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.130 
are a few tricks you can do the basic
required<00:03:01.340> input<00:03:01.850> is<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.239> charge<00:03:02.570> down<00:03:02.840> back

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
required input is you charge down back

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.920 
required input is you charge down back
down<00:03:04.269> forward<00:03:05.269> down<00:03:06.200> back<00:03:06.560> up<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:08.660> what<00:03:08.810> you

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
down forward down back up but what you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.770 
down forward down back up but what you
can<00:03:09.050> do<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.440> can<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:09.590> pull<00:03:09.980> down<00:03:10.010> back

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
can do is you can just pull down back

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.380 
can do is you can just pull down back
press<00:03:11.780> forward<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.350> press<00:03:12.560> up<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.390> it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
press forward and press up and it

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.680 
press forward and press up and it
actually<00:03:14.840> works

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.460 

you'd<00:03:19.690> also<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.110> do<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.320> really<00:03:20.470> quickly

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
you'd also just do it really quickly

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.730 
you'd also just do it really quickly
which<00:03:23.470> might<00:03:24.430> work<00:03:24.610> better<00:03:24.880> if<00:03:25.620> you're<00:03:26.620> not

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
which might work better if you're not

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.390 
which might work better if you're not
sure<00:03:28.380> but<00:03:29.380> that's<00:03:29.560> actually<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.280> easy

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
sure but that's actually really easy

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.990 
sure but that's actually really easy
once<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.030> get<00:03:31.240> used<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.510> just<00:03:31.740> pressing

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
once you get used to just pressing

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.630 
once you get used to just pressing
forward<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.770> do<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:35.890> all<00:03:36.070> day<00:03:38.370> I'll<00:03:39.370> talk

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
forward up do it all day I'll talk

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.310 
forward up do it all day I'll talk
briefly<00:03:39.670> about<00:03:40.120> mash<00:03:40.570> moves<00:03:40.930> they're<00:03:41.140> pretty

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
briefly about mash moves they're pretty

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.440 
briefly about mash moves they're pretty
hard<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> do<00:03:41.650> on<00:03:41.770> a<00:03:41.800> keyboard<00:03:42.100> basically<00:03:43.030> they

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
hard to do on a keyboard basically they

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.800 
hard to do on a keyboard basically they
require<00:03:43.780> five<00:03:44.230> inputs<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:46.090> last<00:03:46.330> input

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
require five inputs and the last input

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.100 
require five inputs and the last input
determines<00:03:47.650> what<00:03:47.800> strengths<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.610> get<00:03:49.110> so

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
determines what strengths you get so

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.460 
determines what strengths you get so
you'd<00:03:50.230> actually<00:03:50.380> press<00:03:51.840> all<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:53.110> your<00:03:53.230> punch

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
you'd actually press all of your punch

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.380 
you'd actually press all of your punch
buttons<00:03:53.830> together<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.580> whatever<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
buttons together it and whatever the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.900 
buttons together it and whatever the
last<00:03:55.600> one<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.140> terms<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.590> strength<00:03:56.920> so

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
last one is the terms of strength so

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.170 
last one is the terms of strength so
that's<00:03:58.330> called<00:03:58.480> piano<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.200> it's<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.380> little

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
that's called piano and it's a little

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.390 
that's called piano and it's a little
easier<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.290> cancel<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.440> if<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.860> piano<00:04:03.160> it

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
easier to cancel it if you piano it

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.220 
easier to cancel it if you piano it
especially<00:04:04.030> for<00:04:04.330> Blancas<00:04:04.720> since<00:04:04.930> it's<00:04:05.080> not<00:04:05.170> a

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
especially for Blancas since it's not a

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.110 
especially for Blancas since it's not a
big<00:04:05.500> deal<00:04:05.680> with<00:04:05.950> what<00:04:06.460> button<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.790> get<00:04:06.970> it

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
big deal with what button you get it

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.470 
big deal with what button you get it
just<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.420> little<00:04:07.780> bit<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:07.990> damage<00:04:08.200> with<00:04:09.480> Honda

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
just a little bit of damage with Honda

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.810 
just a little bit of damage with Honda
it<00:04:11.230> really<00:04:11.530> matters<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.190> I'm<00:04:12.310> not<00:04:12.490> that<00:04:12.670> good

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
it really matters and I'm not that good

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.289 
it really matters and I'm not that good
at<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.710> and<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.800> touch<00:04:14.980> briefly<00:04:15.370> on<00:04:15.670> ghosting
