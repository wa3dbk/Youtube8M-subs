we are excited to announce the phantom 2
Vision+<00:00:24.380> we<00:00:25.280> wanted<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.730> design<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:26.060> flying

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
Vision+ we wanted to design a flying

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.870 
Vision+ we wanted to design a flying
camera<00:00:26.750> that<00:00:27.080> everyone<00:00:27.590> can<00:00:27.800> fly<00:00:28.070> one<00:00:28.760> that

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
camera that everyone can fly one that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.850 
camera that everyone can fly one that
extends<00:00:29.450> vision<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:29.990> allows<00:00:30.350> you<00:00:30.530> to<00:00:30.650> capture

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
extends vision and allows you to capture

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.030 
extends vision and allows you to capture
beauty<00:00:31.430> and<00:00:31.640> adventure<00:00:32.180> from<00:00:32.900> above<00:00:33.170> it's

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
beauty and adventure from above it's

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.920 
beauty and adventure from above it's
your<00:00:34.250> eye<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.610> sky<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.300> will<00:00:35.600> allow<00:00:35.870> you

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
your eye in the sky and will allow you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.660 
your eye in the sky and will allow you
to<00:00:36.020> see<00:00:36.290> things<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.800> never<00:00:37.040> before<00:00:37.489> could

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
to see things you never before could

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.060 
to see things you never before could
imagine<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.989> Vision<00:00:39.260> Plus<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.739> quadcopter

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
imagine the Vision Plus is a quadcopter

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.799 
imagine the Vision Plus is a quadcopter
which<00:00:40.940> means<00:00:41.239> that<00:00:41.480> it's<00:00:41.690> a

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
which means that it's a

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.870 
which means that it's a
remote-controlled<00:00:42.500> aircraft<00:00:42.830> with<00:00:43.640> four

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
remote-controlled aircraft with four

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.850 
remote-controlled aircraft with four
propellers<00:00:44.330> in<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.930> past<00:00:45.170> these<00:00:45.440> were<00:00:45.500> very

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
propellers in the past these were very

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.040 
propellers in the past these were very
difficult<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.370> fly<00:00:46.520> but<00:00:47.090> recent<00:00:47.510> advances<00:00:47.930> in

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
difficult to fly but recent advances in

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.869 
difficult to fly but recent advances in
technology<00:00:48.590> have<00:00:48.800> changed<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.400> completely

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
technology have changed that completely

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.729 
technology have changed that completely
and<00:00:50.150> the<00:00:50.360> reason<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:50.900> these<00:00:51.260> smart

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
and the reason is that these smart

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.690 
and the reason is that these smart
flight<00:00:52.010> controllers<00:00:52.460> that<00:00:52.640> use

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
flight controllers that use

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700 
flight controllers that use
automatically<00:00:53.690> stabilize<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.530> aircraft

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
automatically stabilize the aircraft

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.710 
automatically stabilize the aircraft
when<00:00:55.340> they're<00:00:55.490> in<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:55.670> air<00:00:55.700> their<00:00:56.300> GPS

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
when they're in the air their GPS

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.420 
when they're in the air their GPS
enabled<00:00:56.990> which<00:00:57.500> means<00:00:57.740> that<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.010> Vision<00:00:58.250> Plus

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
enabled which means that the Vision Plus

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.800 
enabled which means that the Vision Plus
always<00:00:58.940> knows<00:00:59.180> where<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.630> is

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
always knows where it is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.990 
always knows where it is
so<00:01:00.500> at<00:01:00.620> any<00:01:00.740> point<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.310> can<00:01:01.460> let<00:01:01.670> go<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
so at any point you can let go of the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.819 
so at any point you can let go of the
radio<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:02.720> will<00:01:02.840> hover<00:01:03.050> exactly<00:01:03.680> where

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
radio and it will hover exactly where

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.100 
radio and it will hover exactly where
you<00:01:03.890> left<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.280> what<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.210> means<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:05.600> us<00:01:05.630> is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
you left it what that means for us is

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.680 
you left it what that means for us is
that<00:01:06.170> they're<00:01:06.500> very<00:01:06.830> easy<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.220> fly<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:07.759> anyone
