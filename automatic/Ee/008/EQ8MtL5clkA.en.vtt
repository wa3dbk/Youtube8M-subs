00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.390 
to my hair I take probably a dime-sized
in<00:05:05.599> my<00:05:05.900> palm<00:05:06.169> or<00:05:06.620> maybe<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.889> little<00:05:07.009> bit<00:05:07.160> more

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
in my palm or maybe a little bit more

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.839 
in my palm or maybe a little bit more
and<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:08.180> just<00:05:08.410> scrunch<00:05:09.410> my<00:05:09.560> hair<00:05:10.009> just<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:10.699> that

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
and I just scrunch my hair just so that

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.850 
and I just scrunch my hair just so that
the<00:05:11.030> bottom<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.479> my<00:05:11.810> hair<00:05:12.020> can<00:05:12.260> become<00:05:12.560> really

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
the bottom of my hair can become really

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.070 
the bottom of my hair can become really
coyly<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.610> everything<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.330> there<00:05:14.780> even

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
coyly and everything and there even

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.450 
coyly and everything and there even
sometimes<00:05:15.470> where<00:05:15.650> I<00:05:15.680> put<00:05:15.919> it<00:05:15.949> at<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.250> back<00:05:16.430> of

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
sometimes where I put it at the back of

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.580 
sometimes where I put it at the back of
my<00:05:16.669> hair<00:05:16.880> because<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.570> gets<00:05:17.750> really<00:05:18.139> really

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
my hair because it gets really really

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.129 
my hair because it gets really really
dry<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:19.220> was<00:05:19.580> ten<00:05:20.030> dollars<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.510> think<00:05:20.539> so<00:05:21.050> it

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
dry this was ten dollars I think so it

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.110 
dry this was ten dollars I think so it
wasn't<00:05:21.440> even<00:05:21.530> that<00:05:21.710> bad<00:05:21.949> it<00:05:22.220> adds<00:05:22.430> shine<00:05:22.789> to

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
wasn't even that bad it adds shine to

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.219 
wasn't even that bad it adds shine to
your<00:05:23.210> hair<00:05:23.449> and<00:05:23.659> it<00:05:23.900> leaves<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.169> feeling

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
your hair and it leaves you feeling

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.649 
your hair and it leaves you feeling
really<00:05:24.770> smooth<00:05:25.099> so<00:05:25.490> I<00:05:25.729> recommend<00:05:26.330> this<00:05:26.419> oil
