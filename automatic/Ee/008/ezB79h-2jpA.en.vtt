00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.260 
on the snit shaky head from black angel
jigs<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.310> what<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.460> does<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.910> gives<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.210> a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
jigs and what it does it gives it a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.310 
jigs and what it does it gives it a
little<00:01:41.360> bit<00:01:41.570> more<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.869> lifelike

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
little bit more of a lifelike

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.050 
little bit more of a lifelike
presentation<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.070> stands<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.550> bait<00:01:43.759> up<00:01:43.970> a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
presentation that stands that bait up a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.210 
presentation that stands that bait up a
