I<00:01:15.229> think<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:15.590> guys

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.000 

it's<00:01:21.420> not<00:01:21.570> whatever<00:01:21.690> this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.050> we<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.470> off<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
it's not whatever this is we just off a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.410 
it's not whatever this is we just off a
little<00:01:26.010> bits<00:01:26.370> and<00:01:26.520> pieces<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> bottom<00:01:27.300> so

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
little bits and pieces on the bottom so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.500 
little bits and pieces on the bottom so
we<00:01:27.510> can<00:01:27.660> open<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.230> under<00:01:28.590> le<00:01:29.240> with<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> pair

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
we can open up that under le with a pair

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.080 
we can open up that under le with a pair
of<00:01:30.540> scissors<00:01:32.090> very<00:01:33.090> carefully<00:01:34.640> just<00:01:35.640> snip<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090

long snip along the bottom like such

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.960 
long snip along the bottom like such
then<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.520> snip<00:01:41.850> along<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.900> other<00:01:43.050> side<00:01:46.970> will

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
then we snip along the other side will

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
then we snip along the other side will
count<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.480> snipping<00:01:48.900> that<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.530> just

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
count on that snipping that will just

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.000 
count on that snipping that will just
come<00:01:49.860> move<00:01:50.280> straight<00:01:50.460> off<00:01:51.770> pull<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> off

come move straight off pull it off
keeping<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.400> tail<00:01:53.610> intact<00:01:54.050> then<00:01:55.050> you'll<00:01:55.170> find
