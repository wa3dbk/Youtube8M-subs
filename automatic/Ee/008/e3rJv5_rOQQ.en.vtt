that's strange then why is this an issue

that's strange then why is this an issue
because<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:38.190> some<00:00:38.399> bikes<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> bottom

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
because on some bikes with a bottom

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.150

this a big deal well this usually

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900 
this a big deal well this usually
manifests<00:00:55.559> into<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:55.860> annoying<00:00:56.340> knocking<00:00:56.760> or

means that the bearings are shot and
