anyway yeah I I don't really like this
alternate<00:02:01.090> mode<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.479> think<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.900> looks<00:02:01.930> kind<00:02:02.380> of

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
alternate mode I think it looks kind of

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.830 
alternate mode I think it looks kind of
silly<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.979> think<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:03.640> obvious<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.150> he<00:02:04.570> turns

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
silly I think it's obvious that he turns

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.320 
silly I think it's obvious that he turns
into<00:02:05.110> something<00:02:05.820> especially<00:02:06.820> considering

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
into something especially considering

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.790 
into something especially considering
there's<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.600> head<00:02:07.869> there<00:02:08.110> there's<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.470> fist

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
there's a head there there's a fist

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.110 
there's a head there there's a fist
there<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:11.200> don't<00:02:12.100> know<00:02:12.250> he<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.670> looks

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
there and I don't know he just looks

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.559 
there and I don't know he just looks
kind<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:14.100> silly<00:02:15.100> but<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:16.120> guess<00:02:16.300> he<00:02:16.450> has<00:02:16.540> a

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
kind of silly but I guess he has a

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.850 
kind of silly but I guess he has a
futuristic<00:02:17.500> space<00:02:21.989> what's<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.140> called<00:02:23.380> cement

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
futuristic space what's it called cement

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.770 
futuristic space what's it called cement
truck<00:02:24.100> there's<00:02:24.700> some<00:02:24.940> kind<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.510> weird

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
truck there's some kind of like weird

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.710 
truck there's some kind of like weird
attack<00:02:26.290> mode<00:02:26.620> for<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.819> Minicon<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.420> sit<00:02:28.600> up

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
attack mode for the Minicon to sit up

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.009 
attack mode for the Minicon to sit up
here<00:02:28.959> and<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:31.060> don't<00:02:31.450> really<00:02:31.720> remember

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
here and do that I don't really remember

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.090 
here and do that I don't really remember
what<00:02:32.290> way<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:32.890> supposed<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.310> be<00:02:33.489> but<00:02:35.100> it's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
what way it's supposed to be but it's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.940 
what way it's supposed to be but it's
kind<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.670> dumb<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> we're<00:02:38.319> going<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.530> ignore<00:02:38.620> it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
kind of dumb so we're going to ignore it

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.729 
kind of dumb so we're going to ignore it
and<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.030> got<00:02:40.120> little<00:02:40.269> handles<00:02:40.750> which<00:02:41.620> is

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
and it's got little handles which is

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.740 
and it's got little handles which is
funny<00:02:41.980> because<00:02:42.220> his<00:02:42.819> Minicon<00:02:43.239> doesn't<00:02:43.630> have

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
funny because his Minicon doesn't have

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.090 
funny because his Minicon doesn't have
he<00:02:43.959> ends<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.940> yeah<00:02:46.120> enough<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.100> let's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
he ends but yeah enough of that let's

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.340 
he ends but yeah enough of that let's
get<00:02:48.310> quick<00:02:48.549> mix<00:02:48.760> transformed<00:02:49.569> into<00:02:49.780> robot

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
get quick mix transformed into robot

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.840 
get quick mix transformed into robot
mode<00:02:52.170> he's<00:02:53.170> pretty<00:02:53.410> simple<00:02:53.890> as<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.489> can<00:02:54.760> see

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
mode he's pretty simple as you can see

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.509 
mode he's pretty simple as you can see
and<00:02:57.850> also<00:02:58.239> kind<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.630> weird<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.650> think<00:03:00.370> it's

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
and also kind of weird I do think it's

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.390 
and also kind of weird I do think it's
interesting<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.120> way<00:03:01.590> his<00:03:02.590> legs<00:03:02.829> work<00:03:03.160> down

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
interesting the way his legs work down

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.560 
interesting the way his legs work down
here<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.850> think<00:03:04.600> it's<00:03:04.720> kind<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.989> neat<00:03:05.400> although

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
here I think it's kind of neat although

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.870 
here I think it's kind of neat although
I'm<00:03:07.570> not<00:03:07.930> happy<00:03:08.500> with<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.010> end<00:03:09.190> result<00:03:09.640> that's

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
I'm not happy with the end result that's

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.220 
I'm not happy with the end result that's
still<00:03:10.180> kind<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.420> neat<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:13.000> case<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.109> guys

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
still kind of neat and in case you guys

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.410 
still kind of neat and in case you guys
don't<00:03:14.560> know<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.010> Cybertron<00:03:15.640> quick<00:03:15.970> mix<00:03:16.180> was

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
don't know and Cybertron quick mix was

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.160 
don't know and Cybertron quick mix was
from<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.900> giant<00:03:17.590> planet<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.340> he<00:03:18.609> has<00:03:18.820> that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
from the giant planet so he has that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.910 
from the giant planet so he has that
growing<00:03:20.170> gimmick<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.709> all<00:03:21.180> three<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.209> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
growing gimmick that all three of the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.180 
growing gimmick that all three of the
giant<00:03:23.920> planet<00:03:24.430> transformers<00:03:25.239> had<00:03:26.070> from<00:03:27.070> the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
giant planet transformers had from the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.520 
giant planet transformers had from the
Cybertron<00:03:27.730> line<00:03:28.000> they<00:03:28.989> made<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.470> was

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
Cybertron line they made it like it was

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.430 
Cybertron line they made it like it was
going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.769> be<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> big<00:03:30.220> thing<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:31.410> really<00:03:32.410> only

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
going to be a big thing but really only

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.050 
going to be a big thing but really only
three<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.890> them<00:03:32.950> did<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.160> but<00:03:33.430> there<00:03:33.579> is<00:03:33.760> quick

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
three of them did it but there is quick

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.630 
three of them did it but there is quick
mix<00:03:34.299> in<00:03:34.540> regular<00:03:35.350> robot<00:03:35.890> mode<00:03:36.070> or<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.280> guess<00:03:36.489> his

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
mix in regular robot mode or I guess his

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.690 
mix in regular robot mode or I guess his
first<00:03:37.359> version<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.140> robot<00:03:38.560> mode<00:03:38.799> this

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
first version of this robot mode this

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.509 
first version of this robot mode this
giant<00:03:40.180> gippy<00:03:40.570> arm<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.890> then<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.130> course<00:03:42.340> is

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
giant gippy arm but then of course is

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.449 
giant gippy arm but then of course is
full<00:03:42.730> transformation<00:03:43.630> do<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.260> grab<00:03:45.130> him<00:03:45.310> and

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
full transformation do you grab him and

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.449 
full transformation do you grab him and
you<00:03:45.549> extend<00:03:46.200> him<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.380> make<00:03:47.530> him<00:03:47.680> even<00:03:47.980> giant

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
you extend him to make him even giant

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.140 
you extend him to make him even giant
her<00:03:49.350> which<00:03:50.350> really<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.980> it's<00:03:51.340> barely

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
her which really it's it's barely

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.090 
her which really it's it's barely
noticeable<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:56.230> just<00:03:56.260> transformed<00:03:56.980> them

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
noticeable and I just transformed them

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.840 
noticeable and I just transformed them
all<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.370> way<00:03:57.489> all<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.450> time<00:03:59.489> metroplex<00:04:00.489> has<00:04:00.819> a

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
all the way all the time metroplex has a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.629

he's the only one with a room no no it's

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.240 
he's the only one with a room no no it's
on<00:04:03.760> true<00:04:03.940> menace<00:04:04.239> or<00:04:04.389> had<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.769> fairly<00:04:05.769> different

on true menace or had a fairly different
looking

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
looking

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.740 
looking
somewhat<00:04:09.099> smaller<00:04:09.430> two<00:04:09.700> giant<00:04:10.150> mode<00:04:10.299> too<00:04:10.510> but

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
somewhat smaller two giant mode too but

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.179 
somewhat smaller two giant mode too but
metroplex<00:04:11.230> had<00:04:11.349> a<00:04:11.379> very<00:04:11.829> different<00:04:12.099> one<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:14.189> I

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
metroplex had a very different one and I

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.229 
metroplex had a very different one and I

bothers<00:04:54.220> me<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.580> it's<00:04:54.669> not<00:04:54.820> because<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:55.090> the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
bothers me and it's not because of the

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.909 
bothers me and it's not because of the
big<00:04:55.389> giant<00:04:56.169> GIMP<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.919> either<00:04:58.289> his<00:04:59.289> head<00:04:59.530> he

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
big giant GIMP and either his head he

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.700 
big giant GIMP and either his head he
looks<00:05:00.310> like<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.610> decepticon<00:05:01.300> logo<00:05:01.539> I<00:05:01.960> think

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
looks like the decepticon logo I think

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.100 
looks like the decepticon logo I think
it's<00:05:02.830> kind<00:05:03.009> of<00:05:03.039> funny<00:05:03.210> he's<00:05:04.210> poseable<00:05:04.840> enough

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
it's kind of funny he's poseable enough

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.170 
it's kind of funny he's poseable enough
oh<00:05:05.259> I'll<00:05:05.560> give<00:05:05.770> them<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:05.889> and<00:05:06.400> what's<00:05:07.000> kind

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
oh I'll give them that and what's kind

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.730 
oh I'll give them that and what's kind
of<00:05:07.330> neat<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:07.840> odd<00:05:08.770> is<00:05:09.310> that<00:05:09.340> this<00:05:10.590> can<00:05:11.590> be

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
of neat and odd is that this can be

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.800 
of neat and odd is that this can be
taken<00:05:12.070> off<00:05:12.250> but<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.580> really<00:05:13.300> can't<00:05:13.599> do

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
taken off but you really can't do

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.589 
taken off but you really can't do
anything<00:05:13.840> with<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.909> except<00:05:15.909> for<00:05:15.940> put<00:05:16.270> it<00:05:16.389> back

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
anything with it except for put it back

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.899 
anything with it except for put it back
on<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:17.169> guess<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.889> could<00:05:17.919> turn<00:05:18.220> it<00:05:18.370> around<00:05:18.430> if

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
on I guess you could turn it around if

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:24.420 
on I guess you could turn it around if
you<00:05:19.000> wanted<00:05:20.039> but<00:05:21.039> otherwise<00:05:21.280> that's<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:23.430> he's

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
you wanted but otherwise that's it he's

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.670 
you wanted but otherwise that's it he's
got<00:05:24.610> kind<00:05:24.909> of<00:05:25.060> weird<00:05:25.360> angled<00:05:25.870> hips<00:05:26.139> just

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
got kind of weird angled hips just

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.250 
got kind of weird angled hips just
because<00:05:27.010> of<00:05:27.190> that<00:05:27.220> extra<00:05:27.940> growth<00:05:28.180> spurt<00:05:28.690> and
