00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
well this is on the defender menu under
security<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.630> have<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:47.000> system<00:00:48.000> which<00:00:48.300> will

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
security we have the system which will

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.010 
security we have the system which will
be<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.930> 10a<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> security<00:00:50.190> system<00:00:51.020> basically

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
be a 10a a security system basically

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590 
be a 10a a security system basically
this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> key<00:00:52.770> fob<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.610> alarm<00:00:53.910> okay

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this is the key fob and the alarm okay

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.380 
this is the key fob and the alarm okay
so<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> show<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.430> perform<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so I'm going to show you this perform a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630 
so I'm going to show you this perform a
test<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> whole<00:00:59.100> kind<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.399> pro

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
test you don't need a whole kind of pro

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.720 
test you don't need a whole kind of pro
to<00:00:59.700> do<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.180> I'm<00:01:00.420> using<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
to do this I'm using this as a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.630 
to do this I'm using this as a
demonstration<00:01:03.229> with<00:01:04.229> live<00:01:04.470> data<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.460> at

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
demonstration with live data to look at

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.710 
demonstration with live data to look at
a<00:01:05.670> certain<00:01:06.210> problem<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.229> now

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
a certain problem that we have now

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.760 
a certain problem that we have now
basically<00:01:09.720> first<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.289> all<00:01:10.440> I've<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.649> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
basically first of all I've got the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.590 
basically first of all I've got the
ignition<00:01:11.190> on<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.610> passenger<00:01:12.119> door<00:01:12.149> is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
ignition on and the passenger door is

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.190 
ignition on and the passenger door is
closed

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
closed

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
closed
well<00:01:13.440> I'm<00:01:13.950> leaning<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.610> through<00:01:14.819> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
well I'm leaning in through the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.389 
well I'm leaning in through the
passenger<00:01:15.450> door<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.229> closed<00:01:16.649> driver's

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
passenger door it's not closed driver's

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.490 
passenger door it's not closed driver's
door<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> saying<00:01:17.940> it's<00:01:18.090> closed<00:01:18.390> key<00:01:19.200> switches

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
door is saying it's closed key switches

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
door is saying it's closed key switches
don't<00:01:19.979> exist<00:01:20.459> and<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> bonnet<00:01:22.619> okay<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.459> open

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
don't exist and the bonnet okay is open

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.870 
don't exist and the bonnet okay is open
well<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.619> perfectly<00:01:26.610> says

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
well if you look here perfectly says

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.630 
well if you look here perfectly says
it's<00:01:27.060> open<00:01:27.209> when<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.959> it's<00:01:28.229> shut<00:01:28.770> now

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's open when it's not it's shut now

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.870 
it's open when it's not it's shut now
all<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.910> doors<00:01:30.209> have<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.929> switches<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.530> them

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
all the doors have a switches on them

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.249 
all the doors have a switches on them
reason<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.149> is<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.599> door<00:01:33.780> gets<00:01:33.990> open

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
reason for this is if the door gets open

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.309 
reason for this is if the door gets open
the<00:01:34.319> alarm<00:01:34.619> goes<00:01:34.830> off<00:01:35.099> so<00:01:35.970> basically<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:37.200> I'm

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
the alarm goes off so basically what I'm

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.160 
the alarm goes off so basically what I'm
looking<00:01:37.349> at<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.720> passenger<00:01:39.720> door<00:01:39.899> again

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
looking at here passenger door again

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.499 
looking at here passenger door again
still<00:01:40.530> saying<00:01:40.800> it's<00:01:41.099> closed<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.179> not

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
still saying it's closed when it's not

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
still saying it's closed when it's not
it's<00:01:42.780> opened<00:01:43.289> we<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.830> an<00:01:44.039> electrical

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it's opened we have an electrical

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.290 
it's opened we have an electrical
problem<00:01:44.819> that<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.810> easily<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.590> overcome

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
problem that can easily be overcome

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.990 
problem that can easily be overcome
right<00:01:48.300> door<00:01:48.869> switches<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.649> okay<00:01:50.369> when

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
right door switches here okay when

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.279 
right door switches here okay when
they're<00:01:51.209> out<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.599> make<00:01:51.750> an<00:01:51.869> electrical

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
they're out they make an electrical

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.410 
they're out they make an electrical
contact<00:01:52.739> when<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.039> doors<00:01:53.250> shut<00:01:53.580> pushed<00:01:54.119> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
contact when the doors shut pushed in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.309 
contact when the doors shut pushed in
like<00:01:55.289> this<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.009> pushed<00:01:56.220> down<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
like this when it's pushed down it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.109 
like this when it's pushed down it
breaks<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.560> electrical<00:01:58.950> contact<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.910> right

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
breaks the electrical contact all right

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.830 
breaks the electrical contact all right
so<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.509> problems<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> bonnet<00:02:03.000> says<00:02:03.360> open

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so we have problems so bonnet says open

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.380 
so we have problems so bonnet says open
I'll<00:02:03.989> push<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.170> down<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.830> says<00:02:05.009> closed<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I'll push it down it says closed so

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
I'll push it down it says closed so
perhaps<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.989> switch<00:02:07.319> here<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.800> not

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
perhaps the switch here is not

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.630 
perhaps the switch here is not
unserviceable<00:02:09.800> however<00:02:10.800> we're<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.340> getting

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
unserviceable however we're not getting

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.540 
unserviceable however we're not getting
a<00:02:11.730> good<00:02:11.910> contact<00:02:12.360> here<00:02:12.630> at<00:02:12.780> all<00:02:13.130> here<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.340> where

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
a good contact here at all here is where

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.250 
a good contact here at all here is where
the<00:02:14.700> switch<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:14.970> touching<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.689> bonnet<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the switch is touching on the bonnet and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.280 
the switch is touching on the bonnet and
you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.069> see<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.610> operates<00:02:18.150> well<00:02:19.049> actually

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you can see it operates well actually

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.350 
you can see it operates well actually
there's<00:02:19.829> not<00:02:19.980> much<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> way<00:02:20.939> that<00:02:21.150> you

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
there's not much of a way that you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.180 
there's not much of a way that you
can<00:02:21.480> test<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.080> switch<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.120> we've<00:02:24.360> removed<00:02:24.600> it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
can test this switch so we've removed it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.710 
can test this switch so we've removed it
lubricated<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.520> then<00:02:26.640> tried<00:02:26.970> again

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
lubricated it and then tried again

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.590 
lubricated it and then tried again
however<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.310> work<00:02:29.570> with<00:02:30.570> a

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
however it's not going to work with a

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.660 
however it's not going to work with a
switch<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.410> bonnet<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> closed

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
switch out the bonnet is in the closed

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.970 
switch out the bonnet is in the closed
position<00:02:32.910> which<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.050> system<00:02:34.260> will<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:34.740> say

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
position which the system will then say

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610 
position which the system will then say
oh<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.580> okay<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.840> we<00:02:37.050> can<00:02:37.260> leave<00:02:37.440> this

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
oh that's okay so we can leave this

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.610 
oh that's okay so we can leave this
disconnected<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:39.450> we<00:02:39.720> could<00:02:39.960> do<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.350> bend

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
disconnected what we could do is bend

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.830 
disconnected what we could do is bend
the<00:02:40.740> bracket<00:02:41.220> up<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.880> brings<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.450> switch

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the bracket up so it brings a switch

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.560 
the bracket up so it brings a switch
further<00:02:43.680> closer<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.580> bonnet<00:02:45.060> that's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
further closer to the bonnet that's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.600 
further closer to the bonnet that's
making<00:02:45.990> contact<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.830> pushing<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.430> further

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
making contact and pushing it further

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
making contact and pushing it further
down<00:02:48.000> into<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.360> body<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> switch<00:02:49.230> however

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
down into the body of the switch however

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.430 
down into the body of the switch however
it<00:02:50.280> feels<00:02:50.520> noisy<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.360> I've<00:02:51.480> decided<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.140> change

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
it feels noisy so I've decided to change

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.650 
it feels noisy so I've decided to change
it<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> driver's<00:02:53.910> door<00:02:53.940> here<00:02:54.450> I'm

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
it in for the driver's door here I'm

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.330 
it in for the driver's door here I'm
gonna<00:02:54.840> pull<00:02:55.140> out<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> switch<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.980> show<00:02:56.280> you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
gonna pull out the switch and show you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.520 
gonna pull out the switch and show you
something<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.540> very<00:02:57.750> common<00:02:58.110> right

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
something and this is very common right

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.449 
something and this is very common right
that<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.100> an<00:02:59.250> earth<00:02:59.489> and<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> positive

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
that is an earth and this is a positive

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.760 
that is an earth and this is a positive
feed<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:03.239> when<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.660> out<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.590> not

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
feed so when it's out like this is not

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.130 
feed so when it's out like this is not
making<00:03:05.010> contact<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.540> making<00:03:06.810> contact

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
making contact in it is making contact

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.790 
making contact in it is making contact
and<00:03:07.709> then<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.670> ground<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.590> rather

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
and then going to ground the rather

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.520 
and then going to ground the rather
rusty<00:03:11.489> looking<00:03:11.790> screw<00:03:12.180> there<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.230> earth

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
rusty looking screw there is the earth

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.000 
rusty looking screw there is the earth
contact<00:03:14.130> for<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.489> switch<00:03:14.970> through<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.750> body

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
contact for the switch through the body

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.250 
contact for the switch through the body
if<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.220> have<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> multimeter<00:03:18.120> especially<00:03:19.080> one

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
if you have a multimeter especially one

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.460 
if you have a multimeter especially one
with<00:03:19.530> an<00:03:19.709> alarm<00:03:20.070> set<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.940> resistance<00:03:21.780> then

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
with an alarm set on resistance then

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.789 
with an alarm set on resistance then
this<00:03:22.890> will<00:03:23.100> help<00:03:23.370> during<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.060> tests<00:03:24.540> okay<00:03:24.959> so

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
this will help during the tests okay so

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.860 
this will help during the tests okay so
if<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> listen<00:03:27.000> we<00:03:27.209> found<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.660> good

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
if you have a listen we found a good

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.780 
if you have a listen we found a good
earth<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.410> we're<00:03:28.650> actually<00:03:28.769> gonna<00:03:29.040> check<00:03:29.580> it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
earth and we're actually gonna check it

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.210 
earth and we're actually gonna check it
to<00:03:30.480> make<00:03:30.510> sure<00:03:30.900> we've<00:03:31.260> got<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.530> noise<00:03:31.830> first

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
to make sure we've got a noise first

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.360 
to make sure we've got a noise first
before<00:03:32.549> we<00:03:32.790> go<00:03:33.060> ahead<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.360> test<00:03:34.280> there's<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
before we go ahead and test there's a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.100 
before we go ahead and test there's a
little<00:03:35.580> chip<00:03:35.700> out<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.940> paintwork<00:03:36.360> just<00:03:36.780> there

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
little chip out the paintwork just there

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.630 
little chip out the paintwork just there
scraping<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.160> noise<00:03:38.640> right<00:03:39.510> earth<00:03:39.870> down<00:03:40.290> here

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
scraping it noise right earth down here

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.850 
scraping it noise right earth down here
okay<00:03:41.670> making<00:03:42.090> contact<00:03:42.269> yes<00:03:42.989> there<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.620> an

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
okay making contact yes there is an

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.830 
okay making contact yes there is an
earth<00:03:44.070> there<00:03:44.549> that's<00:03:44.880> not<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> problem

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
earth there that's not a problem

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
earth there that's not a problem
alright<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.070> voltmeter<00:03:48.060> you're<00:03:48.480> not<00:03:48.570> looking

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
alright so voltmeter you're not looking

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.680 
alright so voltmeter you're not looking
at<00:03:48.870> amps<00:03:49.110> or<00:03:49.230> anything<00:03:49.440> volts<00:03:50.220> set<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.209> volts

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
at amps or anything volts set on volts

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.170 
at amps or anything volts set on volts
DC<00:03:52.080> volts<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.040> we<00:03:53.519> can<00:03:53.700> see<00:03:53.880> if<00:03:54.030> we've

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
DC volts and we can see if we've

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.140 
DC volts and we can see if we've
actually<00:03:54.330> got<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.660> current<00:03:54.959> there<00:03:56.000> we've<00:03:57.000> got

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
actually got a current there we've got

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.449 
actually got a current there we've got
voltage<00:03:57.480> there<00:03:57.720> years<00:03:58.110> 11<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.799> 58

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
voltage there years 11 out of 58

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.080 
voltage there years 11 out of 58
so<00:04:00.299> 11<00:04:00.450> volts<00:04:00.840> 58<00:04:01.700> incidentally<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.730> is

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
so 11 volts 58 incidentally that is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.509 
so 11 volts 58 incidentally that is
actually<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.630> little<00:04:04.019> bit<00:04:04.230> low<00:04:04.650> we're<00:04:04.950> losing

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
actually a little bit low we're losing

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.880 
actually a little bit low we're losing
some<00:04:05.730> voltage<00:04:06.120> at<00:04:06.299> somewhere<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.680> not

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
some voltage at somewhere and it's not

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.990 
some voltage at somewhere and it's not
through<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.250> earth<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.640> I've<00:04:08.760> just

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
through the earth that I've just

selected 11 13 here on another component
says<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.980> we<00:04:14.100> do<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.670> an<00:04:14.790> earth<00:04:14.910> fault<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.360> a

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
says that we do have an earth fault on a

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.539 
says that we do have an earth fault on a
vehicle<00:04:15.750> however<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.859> not<00:04:17.070> affecting

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
the contact areas and what we're gonna

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.100 
the contact areas and what we're gonna
have<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.560> do<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.919> clean<00:04:26.400> these<00:04:26.610> up<00:04:26.900> once<00:04:27.900> these

are<00:04:28.169> cleaned<00:04:28.530> actually<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.100> switch<00:04:29.400> will

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
are cleaned actually the switch will

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.089 
are cleaned actually the switch will
work<00:04:29.820> fine<00:04:30.240> if<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:31.080> don't<00:04:31.289> clean<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.590> up<00:04:31.800> then

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
work fine if you don't clean it up then

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.719 
work fine if you don't clean it up then
you<00:04:32.220> can<00:04:32.370> replace<00:04:32.700> it

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
you can replace it

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.119 
you can replace it
now<00:04:33.939> using<00:04:34.870> a<00:04:34.930> new<00:04:35.139> screw<00:04:35.559> which<00:04:35.800> will<00:04:35.949> give

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
now using a new screw which will give

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.279 
now using a new screw which will give
you<00:04:36.249> a<00:04:36.279> good<00:04:36.490> earth<00:04:36.699> and<00:04:37.629> you<00:04:37.749> can<00:04:37.900> see<00:04:38.050> by<00:04:38.229> the

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
you a good earth and you can see by the

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.110 
you a good earth and you can see by the
state<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.919> screw<00:04:39.249> is<00:04:39.460> not<00:04:39.490> very<00:04:39.879> good

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
state of this screw is not very good

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.839 
state of this screw is not very good
it's<00:04:40.330> rusting<00:04:41.199> so<00:04:42.099> that's<00:04:42.339> not<00:04:42.460> going<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.669> make

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
it's rusting so that's not going to make

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.689 
it's rusting so that's not going to make
good<00:04:43.089> earth<00:04:43.479> contact<00:04:43.870> all<00:04:44.650> right<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:45.189> now<00:04:45.639> the

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
good earth contact all right so now the

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.730 
good earth contact all right so now the
situation's<00:04:46.360> changed<00:04:46.449> it's<00:04:47.050> saying<00:04:47.229> open

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
situation's changed it's saying open

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.200 
situation's changed it's saying open
push<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.759> it<00:04:49.210> will<00:04:49.360> close<00:04:49.629> great<00:04:50.499> so<00:04:51.249> open

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
push it in it will close great so open

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.600 
push it in it will close great so open
we're<00:04:52.449> making<00:04:52.749> an<00:04:52.839> electrical<00:04:53.349> contact<00:04:53.860> you

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
we're making an electrical contact you

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.489 
we're making an electrical contact you
don't<00:04:55.089> need<00:04:55.449> a<00:04:55.479> wall<00:04:55.689> card<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:56.080> do<00:04:56.199> this<00:04:56.379> you

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:56.499 
don't need a wall card to do this you

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:58.649 
don't need a wall card to do this you
could<00:04:56.680> use<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:57.009> lamp<00:04:57.309> for<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:57.909> interior<00:04:58.419> lamp

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
could use the lamp for the interior lamp

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.110 
could use the lamp for the interior lamp
and<00:04:59.020> push<00:04:59.499> it<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.009> out<00:05:00.099> it<00:05:00.729> will<00:05:00.879> check

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
and push it in and out it will check

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.379 
and push it in and out it will check
each<00:05:01.389> switch<00:05:02.020> in<00:05:02.259> turn<00:05:02.740> okay<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.550> we<00:05:04.150> have

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
each switch in turn okay so we have

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.299 
each switch in turn okay so we have
contact<00:05:04.990> there<00:05:05.229> that's<00:05:05.620> great

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:06.309 
contact there that's great

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.820 
contact there that's great
so<00:05:06.909> the<00:05:07.089> bonnet<00:05:07.509> however<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.229> switch<00:05:08.499> here

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
so the bonnet however the switch here

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.980 
so the bonnet however the switch here
we're<00:05:09.610> gonna<00:05:09.819> have<00:05:10.059> to<00:05:10.210> disconnect<00:05:10.659> it<00:05:10.809> for

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
we're gonna have to disconnect it for

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.070 
we're gonna have to disconnect it for
now<00:05:11.199> order<00:05:11.860> one<00:05:12.039> and<00:05:12.360> then<00:05:13.360> replace<00:05:13.809> it

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
now order one and then replace it

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.989 
now order one and then replace it
there's<00:05:14.259> not<00:05:14.409> much<00:05:14.620> more<00:05:14.889> we<00:05:14.979> can<00:05:15.099> do<00:05:15.370> this

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:15.999 
there's not much more we can do this

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.700 
there's not much more we can do this
will<00:05:16.149> make<00:05:16.270> sure<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.509> our<00:05:16.749> security<00:05:17.379> system

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
will make sure that our security system

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.369 
will make sure that our security system
is<00:05:17.800> working<00:05:17.979> properly<00:05:18.399> now<00:05:18.960> with<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.020> Hawkeye

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
is working properly now with the Hawkeye

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.570 
is working properly now with the Hawkeye
other<00:05:20.919> than<00:05:21.279> this<00:05:21.610> we<00:05:22.330> can<00:05:22.360> only<00:05:23.219> sync<00:05:24.219> up<00:05:24.399> the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
other than this we can only sync up the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.399 
other than this we can only sync up the
key<00:05:24.759> fobs<00:05:25.089> to<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.659> ECU

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
key fobs to the ECU

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.320 
key fobs to the ECU
so<00:05:26.800> it<00:05:26.919> wouldn't<00:05:27.159> be<00:05:27.249> worth<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.610> expense<00:05:28.120> on

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
so it wouldn't be worth the expense on

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.259 
so it wouldn't be worth the expense on
an<00:05:28.509> old<00:05:28.659> defender
