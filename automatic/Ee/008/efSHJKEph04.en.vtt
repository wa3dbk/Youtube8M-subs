00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
the collection and i thought it was a

the collection and i thought it was a
decent<00:04:59.840> collection<00:05:00.260> there<00:05:00.800> are<00:05:00.890> a<00:05:00.920> lot<00:05:01.100> of

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.860 
duple colors um i was coming a little
bit<00:05:04.670> disappointing<00:05:05.150> because<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.420> thought<00:05:05.660> I

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
bit disappointing because I thought I

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.020 
bit disappointing because I thought I
guess<00:05:06.290> I<00:05:06.530> expected<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:07.160> lot<00:05:07.310> more<00:05:07.370> from<00:05:07.880> it

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.520 
guess I expected a lot more from it
since<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:08.810> seemed<00:05:08.960> like<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.200> was<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.350> big

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
since it seemed like it was a big

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.380
