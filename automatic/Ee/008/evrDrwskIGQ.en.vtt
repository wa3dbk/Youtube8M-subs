00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
wouldn't be all that hard but to me it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
wouldn't be all that hard but to me it
really<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.650> lucky<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> game<00:01:32.220> was

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.399 
really was so it was lucky the game was
surprisingly<00:01:32.820> forgiving<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.810> die<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
you will you start back at the beginning

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
you will you start back at the beginning
