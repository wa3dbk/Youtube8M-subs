just<00:02:24.060> put<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.300> out<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:24.870> 12<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.500> these

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
just put it out there was 12 of these

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.770 
just put it out there was 12 of these
things<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.420> shouldn't<00:02:27.720> really

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
things in there so it shouldn't really

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.140 
things in there so it shouldn't really
be<00:02:27.990> hard<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.500> find<00:02:28.800> unless<00:02:29.430> guys<00:02:29.700> are<00:02:29.910> buying

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
be hard to find unless guys are buying

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.410 
be hard to find unless guys are buying
all<00:02:30.540> 12<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.380> them<00:02:31.530> which<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.610> imagine<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:33.180> what's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
all 12 of them which I imagine is what's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.790 
all 12 of them which I imagine is what's
happening<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:34.170> I've<00:02:34.410> seen<00:02:34.650> these

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
happening because I've seen these

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.890 
happening because I've seen these
shippers<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.340> couple<00:02:35.640> stores<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.750> is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
shippers in a couple stores and this is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.740 
shippers in a couple stores and this is
the<00:02:37.020> only<00:02:37.110> car<00:02:37.440> that's<00:02:38.060> not<00:02:39.060> there<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.540> i'm

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the only car that's not there so i'm

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.570 
the only car that's not there so i'm
guessing<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.290> guys<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:40.950> buying<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.550> of

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
guessing the guys are just buying all of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.300 
guessing the guys are just buying all of
them<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:43.070> making<00:02:44.070> them<00:02:44.190> hard<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.550> find<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.120> i

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
them and making them hard to find so i

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.720 
them and making them hard to find so i
hope<00:02:47.310> you're<00:02:47.490> able<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.700> find<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:50.010> i<00:02:50.370> don't
