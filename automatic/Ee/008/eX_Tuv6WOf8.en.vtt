00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
okay two dirt you just a quick video

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.570 
okay two dirt you just a quick video
because<00:00:09.670> of<00:00:09.700> him

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
because of him

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.280 
because of him
ask<00:00:10.790> him<00:00:11.030> in<00:00:11.150> with<00:00:11.360> these<00:00:11.540> four<00:00:12.019> button

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
ask him in with these four button

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.200 
ask him in with these four button
changes<00:00:12.590> how<00:00:12.889> do<00:00:12.950> you<00:00:13.219> get<00:00:13.730> them<00:00:13.880> to<00:00:13.969> charge

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
changes how do you get them to charge

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.720 
changes how do you get them to charge
lithium<00:00:15.139> iron<00:00:15.320> phosphate<00:00:15.740> or<00:00:16.129> a<00:00:16.279> one<00:00:16.520> two

lithium iron phosphate or a one two

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.089 
lithium iron phosphate or a one two
three<00:00:16.990> batteries<00:00:17.990> because<00:00:18.260> normally<00:00:18.980> you

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
three batteries because normally you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.320 
three batteries because normally you
just<00:00:19.130> have<00:00:19.460> if<00:00:19.700> we<00:00:19.849> stick<00:00:20.090> through<00:00:20.240> the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
just have if we stick through the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.249 
just have if we stick through the
options<00:00:21.080> here<00:00:21.230> you'll<00:00:21.410> see<00:00:21.529> you<00:00:21.590> got<00:00:21.710> lipo

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
options here you'll see you got lipo

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.900 
options here you'll see you got lipo
lipo<00:00:24.259> you<00:00:25.160> know<00:00:25.279> mhm<00:00:25.580> no<00:00:26.540> I<00:00:26.570> cared<00:00:26.980> lid<00:00:27.980> and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
lipo you know mhm no I cared lid and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.269 
lipo you know mhm no I cared lid and
then<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:29.720> mother<00:00:29.900> save<00:00:30.199> load<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:30.890> other<00:00:31.010> stuff

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
then to mother save load and other stuff

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.729 
then to mother save load and other stuff
set<00:00:31.670> program<00:00:31.910> but<00:00:32.570> there's<00:00:32.720> no<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:33.110> one<00:00:33.559> two

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
set program but there's no a one two

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.610 
set program but there's no a one two
three<00:00:33.949> or<00:00:34.070> L<00:00:34.280> right<00:00:34.550> if<00:00:34.760> each<00:00:35.090> option<00:00:35.510> on<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
three or L right if each option on the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.650 
three or L right if each option on the
charger<00:00:37.040> well<00:00:37.610> it's<00:00:38.210> not<00:00:38.360> exactly

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
charger well it's not exactly

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.119 
charger well it's not exactly
straightforward<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:39.680> I'll<00:00:39.739> show<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.010> what

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
straightforward so I'll show you what

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.220 
straightforward so I'll show you what
you<00:00:40.250> do<00:00:40.370> we<00:00:40.670> step<00:00:40.970> through<00:00:41.000> until<00:00:41.930> we<00:00:41.960> come<00:00:42.199> to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
you do we step through until we come to

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.049 
you do we step through until we come to
use<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.129> set<00:00:43.519> program

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
use a set program

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.030 
use a set program
this<00:00:44.870> enables<00:00:45.260> us<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.350> change<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:45.860> voltage

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
this enables us to change the voltage

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.280 
this enables us to change the voltage
that<00:00:46.519> will<00:00:47.120> be<00:00:47.239> charging<00:00:47.600> into<00:00:47.870> our<00:00:47.989> battery

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
that will be charging into our battery

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.990 
that will be charging into our battery
so<00:00:48.440> if<00:00:48.500> we<00:00:48.589> hit<00:00:48.920> enter<00:00:49.750> then<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.839> gives<00:00:50.989> us<00:00:52.000> V

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
so if we hit enter then it gives us V

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.570 
so if we hit enter then it gives us V
type<00:00:53.269> says<00:00:54.049> lipo<00:00:54.409> nurse<00:00:54.559> is<00:00:54.710> 3.7<00:00:55.250> here<00:00:55.460> cuz

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
type says lipo nurse is 3.7 here cuz

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.579 
type says lipo nurse is 3.7 here cuz
that's<00:00:55.729> the<00:00:55.790> voltage<00:00:56.030> per<00:00:56.420> cell<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:57.440> you

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
that's the voltage per cell that you

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.740 
that's the voltage per cell that you
lipo<00:00:57.860> batteries<00:00:58.190> operate<00:00:58.519> on<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.210> what<00:00:59.659> you

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
lipo batteries operate on so what you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.899 
lipo batteries operate on so what you
can<00:00:59.900> do<00:01:00.080> is<00:01:00.379> just<00:01:00.619> press<00:01:00.830> ENTER<00:01:01.190> again<00:01:01.250> now

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
can do is just press ENTER again now

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.600 
can do is just press ENTER again now
that<00:01:02.059> voltage<00:01:02.269> will<00:01:02.600> flash<00:01:03.339> then<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.460> can

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
that voltage will flash then you can

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.180 
that voltage will flash then you can
just<00:01:04.790> step<00:01:04.970> through<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.290> see<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:07.070> gone

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
just step through and you see it's gone

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.429 
just step through and you see it's gone
to<00:01:07.310> three<00:01:07.460> point<00:01:07.670> six<00:01:07.909> which<00:01:08.810> says<00:01:08.990> lie<00:01:09.229> low

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
to three point six which says lie low

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.859 
to three point six which says lie low
which<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.770> old<00:01:10.010> lithium<00:01:10.760> ion<00:01:11.119> liya<00:01:11.390> betting

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
which is old lithium ion liya betting

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:12.969 
which is old lithium ion liya betting
batteries<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.439> don't<00:01:12.590> use<00:01:12.770> those<00:01:12.920> anymore

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
batteries you don't use those anymore

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.880 
batteries you don't use those anymore
they're<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.640> relic<00:01:14.330> from<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.510> past<00:01:14.800> put<00:01:15.800> it
