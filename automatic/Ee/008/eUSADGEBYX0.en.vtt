00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:11.689
Mum always told me, never speak cooked rice

Today when I look back, I had no idea how right she was ...

The rules, the laws need to be applied.

The State in place must be respected.
We, represent the French people!

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.193
The rules, the laws need to be applied.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:45.761
The people had the choice to vote.

00:00:45.932 --> 00:00:47.566
The State in place must be respected.

00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:48.966
We...

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:51.967
Understand that in the end, I have a hard time believing you.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.436
Your words disgust me, I have a hard time swallowing them.

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:57.571
Please come see a little closer what really happens in our hoods!

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.708
If we read between the lines of your speech, we slalom  Everyday, since we need to get through.

00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:05.359
Its not some sad pictures or statistics that could tell you this

00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:08.244
Words, words that's disgust all of us

00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:10.845
Words, you talk of insalubrity!

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.512
Mark my word! Who among you had a taste?

00:01:12.714 --> 00:01:15.447
I grew up in rice grains and superposed beds.

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:17.582
Te-te-te te Tear up your analyses,

00:01:17.684 --> 00:01:19.150
Become aware of what is happening to us!

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:21.085
Under your numbers and "stats" of unemployment,

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:23.890
With each of your errors thousands of lives dangerously bend,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.690
Aiming straight for the wall, the mother who's becoming exhausted,

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:27.659
the father unemployed : I'm fifteen years old and I can't stand it anymore!

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:29.859
Every night he messes with my head telling me not to be disappointed

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:32.109
"You eat, you sleep...": All to be happy its sure !

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:34.093
Feelings of being powerless that cant be forgotten!

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:36.248
Which one among you has lived through that?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.662
How many of you have been faced with this choice?

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.131
"put up with the bailiffs or bends the laws"?

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:43.901
The rules, the laws need to be applied.
The people had the choice to vote.

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:48.136
The State in place must be respected.
We, represent the French people!

00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:52.304
You, who cant keep a promise,
Its us, who keep paying all the time!

00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:56.839
All your failure show that you do not know anything about us
But who are you !?

00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:00.307
who cant keep a promise, it's us, who keep paying all the time!

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.974
All your failure show that you do not know anything about us
But who are you !?

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.209
You !!!

00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.310
...

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:41.511
You spoke of us " karcherised", clean up the streets

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:43.992
You only stirred up anger and bitterness

00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:45.931
You took over the "Elysee" while spitting on us,

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:47.918
With the help of the press who licked your ass!

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.587
They silenced the results of your catastrophic plans,

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.209
The mistakes and abuses of your police.

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.025
Since then there is a problem, there is less teachers,

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:56.194
Less supervision, so more delinquents

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:58.096
The most dreadful thing is, I believe its your solutions;

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.798
Its not education but detention centers,

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.007
Before cleaning up the ghetto, go clean up your political party!

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.535
Your zero tolerance policy, no but who are you kidding? !

00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:09.111
How many  dirty millions go missing under the table during their judgment day...

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:12.812
Where the tribunal is so corrupted, that even the judge lies!

00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:15.221
You have it all: and your still scheming.

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:17.022
At the bottom of their grave, my delinquents only imitate you.

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:21.579
Get indignant! But im only saying the truth, 
you are the reflection of the people you criticize!

00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.796
I will not even mention you fascist speeches!

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.008
Coz their wouldn't be enough space on my CD!

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:28.009
The years go by but we are fighting and we are still here.

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.794
Curious to see how we clean with dirty hands !

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:34.696
The rules, the laws need to be applied.
The people had the choice to vote.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:38.164
The State in place must be respected.
We, represent the French people!

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:42.067
You ! Who cant keep a promise, 
it's us, who keep paying all the time!

00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:47.975
All your failures show that you do not know anything about us
But who are you !?

00:03:48.473 --> 00:03:51.013
Who cant keep a promise, 
it's us, who keep paying all the time!

00:03:51.577 --> 00:03:55.986
All your failures show that you do not know anything about us
But who are you !?

00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:59.086
Who cant keep a promise, 
it's us, who keep paying all the time!

00:03:59.654 --> 00:04:03.986
All your failures show that you do not know anything about us
But who are you !?...

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:05.788

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:11.894
Hey ! Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:14.562
Everyday I hear about  "the upper France, the lower France"...

00:04:14.984 --> 00:04:16.896
it's the kind of sentence that makes me dizzy!...

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:18.678
We all have our feet on the ground no? So!

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.635
What are we trying to feed us from left, right, center and the extremes!

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:24.304
Hey! Lets get something right; being French, what is that?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.508
An origin? A color? A religion or a nationality?

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.576
Its time to open our eyes and understand that it's together that we can accomplish something!

00:04:32.098 --> 00:04:34.612
It's Together that we will accomplish something!

00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:38.780
It's Together that we will accomplish something!

00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:41.282
It's Together that we will accomplish something!

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:47.684
Togetheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer !!!!

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:09.077
I'll... I'll... I'll call you back

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.020
In what concerns him, it was the happy ending we had hoped.
But for us, it was the beginning of trouble!
