00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.550 

okay<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.300> first<00:00:22.480> step<00:00:22.750> is<00:00:22.900> obviously<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.260> warm

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
okay the first step is obviously to warm

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.590 
okay the first step is obviously to warm
up<00:00:23.680> they<00:00:24.369> look<00:00:24.490> into<00:00:24.760> that<00:00:24.910> I'll<00:00:25.330> probably

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
up they look into that I'll probably

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.910 
up they look into that I'll probably
break<00:00:25.840> it<00:00:25.990> into<00:00:26.140> three<00:00:26.440> parts

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
break it into three parts

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.220 
break it into three parts
okay<00:00:27.430> first<00:00:27.699> part<00:00:28.000> be<00:00:28.359> five<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.779> ten<00:00:28.960> minutes

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
okay first part be five to ten minutes

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.750 
okay first part be five to ten minutes
some<00:00:29.410> jog<00:00:29.680> in<00:00:29.859> some<00:00:30.070> light<00:00:30.250> movements<00:00:30.730> just

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
some jog in some light movements just

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.939 
some jog in some light movements just
get<00:00:31.000> that<00:00:31.090> heart<00:00:31.330> rate<00:00:31.390> going<00:00:31.619> okay<00:00:32.619> before<00:00:32.769> we

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
get that heart rate going okay before we

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.440 
get that heart rate going okay before we
move<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.489> next<00:00:33.640> stage<00:00:33.940> which<00:00:34.180> will<00:00:34.300> be

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
move on to the next stage which will be

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.750 
move on to the next stage which will be
more<00:00:34.660> kind<00:00:34.899> of<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:35.110> dynamic<00:00:35.470> stretching<00:00:36.190> with

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
more kind of a dynamic stretching with

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.190 
more kind of a dynamic stretching with
our<00:00:36.940> dynamic<00:00:37.120> stretching<00:00:37.750> we're<00:00:37.870> looking<00:00:38.079> at

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
our dynamic stretching we're looking at

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.150 
our dynamic stretching we're looking at
movements<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.770> are<00:00:38.829> going<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.070> be

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
movements that are going to be

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.530 
movements that are going to be
replicated<00:00:39.370> in<00:00:39.760> there<00:00:40.000> in<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.239> five-a-side

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
replicated in there in the five-a-side

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.170 
replicated in there in the five-a-side
game<00:00:41.190> especially<00:00:42.190> looking<00:00:43.030> around

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
game especially looking around

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.830 
game especially looking around
hamstrings<00:00:44.110> CAF's<00:00:44.800> okay<00:00:45.420> we're<00:00:46.420> five-a-side

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
hamstrings CAF's okay we're five-a-side

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.700 
hamstrings CAF's okay we're five-a-side
football<00:00:46.930> there'll<00:00:47.440> be<00:00:47.469> a<00:00:47.530> lot<00:00:47.680> of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
football there'll be a lot of

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.619 
football there'll be a lot of
acceleration<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.550> deceleration<00:00:48.730> so<00:00:49.510> we're

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
acceleration and deceleration so we're

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.729 
acceleration and deceleration so we're
really<00:00:49.780> trying<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.079> get<00:00:50.200> those<00:00:50.320> hamstrings

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
really trying to get those hamstrings

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.470 
really trying to get those hamstrings
warmed<00:00:51.100> up<00:00:51.219> there's<00:00:52.059> going<00:00:52.149> to<00:00:52.210> be<00:00:52.270> a<00:00:52.329> lot<00:00:52.450> of

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
warmed up there's going to be a lot of

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.430 
warmed up there's going to be a lot of
lunging

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
lunging

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.190 
lunging
so<00:00:53.860> therefore<00:00:54.100> hip<00:00:54.550> mobility<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:55.120> key<00:00:55.329> okay<00:00:55.989> in

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
so therefore hip mobility is key okay in

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.709 
so therefore hip mobility is key okay in
terms<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.559> hip<00:00:56.739> flexor<00:00:57.070> stretches<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:58.090> really

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
terms of hip flexor stretches and really

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.810 
terms of hip flexor stretches and really
trying<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.020> warm<00:00:59.200> them<00:00:59.410> up<00:00:59.440> okay<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:00.399> reduce

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
trying to warm them up okay so we reduce

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.880 
trying to warm them up okay so we reduce
the<00:01:00.969> risk<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.270> injury<00:01:01.440> from<00:01:02.440> another<00:01:02.680> point

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
the risk of injury from another point

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.789 
the risk of injury from another point
okay<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:04.000> course<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:05.049> five<00:01:05.350> aside<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.649> use<00:01:05.770> a

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
okay of course in five aside we use a

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.889 
okay of course in five aside we use a
lot<00:01:06.039> of<00:01:06.159> upper<00:01:06.340> body<00:01:06.369> strength<00:01:06.639> okay<00:01:07.359> in<00:01:07.749> terms

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
lot of upper body strength okay in terms

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.050 
lot of upper body strength okay in terms
of<00:01:08.049> shielding<00:01:08.439> so<00:01:08.859> therefore<00:01:09.310> still<00:01:09.789> warming

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
of shielding so therefore still warming

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.639 
of shielding so therefore still warming
up<00:01:10.149> that<00:01:10.329> upper<00:01:10.539> body<00:01:10.659> stretching<00:01:11.319> off<00:01:11.409> those

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
up that upper body stretching off those

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.660 
up that upper body stretching off those
upper<00:01:12.130> body<00:01:12.340> regions<00:01:12.850> it's<00:01:13.119> still<00:01:13.299> important

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
upper body regions it's still important

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.309 
upper body regions it's still important
then<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.700> next<00:01:16.060> thing<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.479> we<00:01:16.719> move<00:01:16.929> on<00:01:17.109> to

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
then the next thing that we move on to

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.440 
then the next thing that we move on to
is<00:01:17.529> more<00:01:18.249> of<00:01:18.340> an<00:01:18.429> intense<00:01:18.729> type<00:01:18.999> of<00:01:19.149> warm<00:01:19.359> up

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
is more of an intense type of warm up

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.999 
is more of an intense type of warm up
especially<00:01:19.959> Sprint's<00:01:20.529> that<00:01:20.740> will<00:01:20.889> be

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
especially Sprint's that will be

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.709 
especially Sprint's that will be
replicated<00:01:21.189> in<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.670> game<00:01:21.880> one<00:01:22.569> of<00:01:22.659> the

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
replicated in the game one of the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.089 
replicated in the game one of the
problems<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:23.109> we<00:01:23.259> see<00:01:23.289> is<00:01:23.679> that<00:01:24.039> people

00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:24.099 
problems that we see is that people

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:27.330 
problems that we see is that people
don't<00:01:24.429> warm<00:01:24.880> up<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.509> an<00:01:25.599> intensity<00:01:26.109> enough<00:01:26.679> so

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
don't warm up to an intensity enough so

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.889 
don't warm up to an intensity enough so
take<00:01:27.609> some<00:01:27.759> time<00:01:27.789> get<00:01:28.299> your<00:01:28.359> heart<00:01:28.599> rate<00:01:28.719> going

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
take some time get your heart rate going

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.679 
take some time get your heart rate going
get<00:01:29.170> those<00:01:29.259> muscles<00:01:29.469> firing<00:01:29.920> okay<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.119> this

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
get those muscles firing okay and this

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.419 
get those muscles firing okay and this
then<00:01:31.959> will<00:01:32.200> lead<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.859> you<00:01:32.979> being<00:01:33.009> have<00:01:33.340> an

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
then will lead to you being have an

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.190 
then will lead to you being have an
improvement<00:01:33.789> performance<00:01:34.119> during<00:01:35.109> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
improvement performance during the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.480 
improvement performance during the
course<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.499> the<00:01:35.619> game<00:01:38.069> from<00:01:39.069> a<00:01:39.159> five-a-side

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
course of the game from a five-a-side

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.399 
course of the game from a five-a-side
point<00:01:39.849> of<00:01:39.909> view<00:01:40.090> okay<00:01:40.509> with<00:01:40.929> just<00:01:40.959> their

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
point of view okay with just their

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.349 
point of view okay with just their
exercise<00:01:41.859> for<00:01:42.039> 60<00:01:42.310> minutes<00:01:42.669> pretty<00:01:43.090> intense

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
exercise for 60 minutes pretty intense

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.479 
exercise for 60 minutes pretty intense
we<00:01:43.869> should<00:01:44.139> be<00:01:44.229> looking<00:01:44.499> at<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.709> areas<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.369> the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:45.489 
we should be looking at the areas of the

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:46.709 
we should be looking at the areas of the
stuff<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.729> we've<00:01:45.939> used<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.329> case<00:01:46.509> of<00:01:46.689> our

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
stuff that we've used the case of our

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.739 
stuff that we've used the case of our
quads<00:01:47.079> our<00:01:47.380> hammies<00:01:47.829> okay<00:01:48.609> our<00:01:48.939> carps<00:01:49.509> the

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
quads our hammies okay our carps the

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:51.359 
quads our hammies okay our carps the
areas<00:01:50.049> that<00:01:50.079> we<00:01:50.409> probably<00:01:50.859> done<00:01:51.099> the<00:01:51.189> most

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
areas that we probably done the most

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.330 
areas that we probably done the most
amount<00:01:51.609> of<00:01:51.729> damage<00:01:51.789> okay<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.829> know<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.009> be

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
amount of damage okay you know to be

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.370 
amount of damage okay you know to be
able<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.520> adapt<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.149> recover<00:01:55.450> as<00:01:55.989> fast<00:01:56.229> as

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
able to adapt and recover as fast as

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.379 
able to adapt and recover as fast as
possible<00:01:56.799> so<00:01:57.399> therefore<00:01:57.579> if<00:01:57.819> we're<00:01:57.999> training

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
possible so therefore if we're training
