00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
Christmas it was a gift from my

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.610 
Christmas it was a gift from my
girlfriend<00:00:12.330> at<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.690> time<00:00:12.780> which<00:00:13.290> was<00:00:13.440> really

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
girlfriend at the time which was really

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.470 
girlfriend at the time which was really
cool<00:00:14.420> I<00:00:15.420> think<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.500> costs<00:00:16.740> around<00:00:17.060> 120<00:00:18.060> dollars

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
cool I think it costs around 120 dollars

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.890 
cool I think it costs around 120 dollars
somewhere<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.350> range<00:00:20.600> it<00:00:21.600> comes<00:00:21.840> with

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
somewhere in that range it comes with

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.450 
somewhere in that range it comes with
five<00:00:22.140> mini<00:00:22.320> figs<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.769> only<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.039> two<00:00:23.279> out

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
five mini figs they only have two out

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.710 
five mini figs they only have two out
right<00:00:23.670> now<00:00:23.820> because<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> other<00:00:24.420> three<00:00:24.689> are

because<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.340> you've<00:01:17.610> seen<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> clone<00:01:18.240> war

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450

series<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.140> headpiece<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.759> fin<00:01:21.119> part<00:01:21.450> on

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
series the headpiece this fin part on

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
series the headpiece this fin part on
the<00:01:21.659> top<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.110> much<00:01:22.350> bigger<00:01:22.619> sticks<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.210 
the top is much bigger sticks out a
little<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.610> more<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.500> guess<00:01:25.799> they

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
little bit more but I guess they

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
little bit more but I guess they
couldn't<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> helmet<00:01:27.689> that's<00:01:27.869> fine

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
couldn't do it on the helmet that's fine

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.670 
couldn't do it on the helmet that's fine

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
but I'm not a fan of it looks nice as a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
but I'm not a fan of it looks nice as a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
and on the very back there is an escape

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.710 
and on the very back there is an escape
pod<00:05:10.020> this<00:05:11.020> is<00:05:11.260> pretty<00:05:11.470> cool<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:12.010> give<00:05:12.160> the

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
inside you could fit a little bit more

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.750 
inside you could fit a little bit more
if<00:06:08.410> you<00:06:08.530> took<00:06:08.620> up<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:08.860> desk<00:06:09.100> and<00:06:09.340> share<00:06:09.610> it

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
if you took up the desk and share it

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.130 
if you took up the desk and share it
here<00:06:09.970> but<00:06:10.120> even<00:06:10.480> then<00:06:10.630> it<00:06:10.750> would<00:06:10.870> only<00:06:10.960> be

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
here but even then it would only be

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.900 
here but even then it would only be
about<00:06:11.440> four<00:06:11.830> I<00:06:12.210> don't<00:06:13.210> like<00:06:13.480> them<00:06:13.660> but<00:06:14.910> it's

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
about four I don't like them but it's

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.580 
about four I don't like them but it's
all<00:06:16.150> right<00:06:16.390> I<00:06:16.660> can<00:06:17.050> deal<00:06:17.200> with<00:06:17.320> it<00:06:17.410> because

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
all right I can deal with it because

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.190 
all right I can deal with it because
this<00:06:17.860> is<00:06:18.010> more<00:06:18.220> about<00:06:18.310> displaying<00:06:19.150> sort<00:06:20.140> of

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
this is more about displaying sort of

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.220 
this is more about displaying sort of
ship<00:06:20.380> than<00:06:20.530> there's<00:06:20.710> a<00:06:20.770> playing<00:06:21.100> one<00:06:21.310> I<00:06:21.340> guess

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
ship than there's a playing one I guess

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.040 
ship than there's a playing one I guess
they<00:06:23.230> do<00:06:23.290> have<00:06:23.500> more<00:06:23.680> ground<00:06:24.010> transports<00:06:25.050> sets

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
they do have more ground transports sets

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.170 
they do have more ground transports sets
now<00:06:26.290> like<00:06:26.890> that<00:06:27.070> turbo<00:06:27.340> tank<00:06:27.580> just<00:06:27.760> came<00:06:27.970> out

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
now like that turbo tank just came out

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.610 
now like that turbo tank just came out
recently<00:06:28.420> I'm<00:06:28.810> sure<00:06:29.020> that<00:06:29.200> could<00:06:29.320> fit<00:06:29.500> in

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
recently I'm sure that could fit in

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.710 
recently I'm sure that could fit in
plenty<00:06:29.920> but<00:06:30.700> it<00:06:31.090> would<00:06:31.180> have<00:06:31.270> been<00:06:31.330> nice<00:06:31.510> been

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
plenty but it would have been nice been

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.510

able to fit more than a few you can
manage<00:06:34.330> to<00:06:34.600> stick<00:06:34.900> one<00:06:35.140> like<00:06:35.560> a<00:06:35.590> clone<00:06:35.950> over<00:06:36.370> in

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
manage to stick one like a clone over in
