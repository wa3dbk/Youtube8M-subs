00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.400
 patator is that the first shot is 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.780

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.949
 enough oxygen and waters of the year 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.100
 powerful than the first 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 seen that it'll be shielded from co2 and or 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.890
