 good girls welcome to my channel a 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 again today we are going to recreate this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.510
 makeup that is super shocking what 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.119
 first thing that catches your attention are the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.580
 brown lips a different lips 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 very gothic but very juicy and pretty 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.020
 in those in the eyes I created a mixture 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.759
 between earth tones that give a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.710
 conjunction to the whole face much more 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.420
 warm despite the fact that they are very 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.950
 intense is quite warm and easy to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.390
 carry so if you want to see how 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.390

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 the mobile eyelid with a prebase of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 shadows so that the shadows last longer and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.870
 look more intense and I will create a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.300
 little intensity gently in the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.440
 banana applying a matte brown shade 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 with a brush to blur 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.540
 and we will directly apply in the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.130
 shadow that will do against attention of 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.920

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.630

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.300
 mk kit of falling ice hoops are a pass 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.340
 what pigments leave a very color 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.900
 nice and they are like super creamy they 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.700
 apply very easily I will 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.260
 apply it all over the mobile eyelid and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.460
 I'm going to blur until the banana 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.380
 use the same shadow he used 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.190
 previously to blur the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.190
 morning cut 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.870
 creating integration are more fluid I'll 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.610
 to take the same brush to blur 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.040
 has been using for the previous shadow 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.840
 and I'm going to take a little bit of the shadow 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.600
 green and apply it gently in the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.520
 tomorrow then I will retouch the cut 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.500
 blurring it with the brown shadow 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.119
 first and then blur the cut of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.900
 this first brown shadow with a 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.900
 matte beige shadow 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.820
 I want to add a touch of luminosity 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.100
 different contrast I'm going to apply this 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.470
 shadow that is like orange with a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.600
 finished in very nice silver right at the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.130
 Lacrimal area to give you much more 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.120
 opening of the gaze and also in the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.120
 lower line of tabs 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.430
 to give another makeup contrast 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.720
 I'm going to apply this copper shadow on the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.459
 bottom line of eyelashes we're going to 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.600
 blur with the same brown shadow that 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.600
 we applied in the morning 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.280
 You can add a slight touch of 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 intensity with a brown cabbage in the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.150
 water interior 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.019
 to give an integration to all the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.549
 makeup I will apply the same shadow 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.319
 cover that applied the bottom line of 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.329
 eyelashes in the area of ​​the banana and 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.599
 blur the cut with the beige shadow 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.599
 mate 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.150
 this next step is totally 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.280
 optional but I wanted to give it a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.530
 little bit more intensity in the part of 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.410
 the external ub of the eye applying this 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.510
 same a copper shadow in the most part 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.410
 external of the eye and blurring the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.410
 integrate it with the green 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.900
 let's see the intensity steps I'm going 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.930
 to touch up the eyebrows this time the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.520
 I'm going to do more with a straight design that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.840
 they are very fashionable and I wanted to integrate 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.000
 in this makeup then I'm going to 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.190
 make my eyelashes apply a 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.750
 layer of mascara and we will pass 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.100
 to give the final intensity touch to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.100
 eye makeup that will be a line 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.540
 to continue maintaining the luminosity 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.270
 of makeup I will choose to make a 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 eyeliner that is cut just before 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.320
 start the lighting shadow of the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.660
 lacrimal area and that will be like 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.300
 two thirds inside the top line 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.370
 of tabs and the outside of the 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.560
 corner of the eyeliner this I leave it 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.180
 optionally to you as much as you want 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.170
 lengthen making it wider more 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.170
 close as you like 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.750
 the touch of glamor is going to take 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.220
 set of false eyelashes but you know 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.290
 As I always say it's totally optional 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.630
 and we can simply use several layers 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.610
 of eyelash masks let's move on to 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.930
 face first clean possible there 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.730
 this product of the eyes and we're going to 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.560
 apply the first product I'm going to 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.180
 opt for the concealer to cover 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.080
 dark circles and also to clean the part 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.080
 lower eye makeup 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.500
 let's move on to apply the base of 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.660
 makeup as always from the center 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.790
 towards the edge of the face applying it 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.889
 also towards the jaw line and 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.419
 the neck the growth line of the 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.750
 top hair and also a little 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.750
 ears

 more everything with the powders works best for you 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.389
 your face you like more the finish I go 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.490
 to opt for loose translucent and 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.860
 then we will give the color back and 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.319
 the volume on our face for about 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.330
 use a rouge and a contour 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.680
 Two sun powders in one real mix 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.210

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.479
 cheekbones rising a little towards the 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.479
 temple 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.440
 and we go to the lips we take the 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.240
 pencil that I've spoken to you before 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.520
