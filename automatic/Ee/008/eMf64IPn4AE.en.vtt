basically<00:00:06.720> added<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.649> rubber<00:00:08.610> o-ring<00:00:08.700> to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
basically added a rubber o-ring to

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.499 
basically added a rubber o-ring to
increase<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> space<00:00:09.990> here<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:12.120> belt<00:00:12.269> doesn't

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
increase the space here the belt doesn't

two tabs here the lower one the motor

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.230 
two tabs here the lower one the motor

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.410 

the<00:01:49.859> seal<00:01:50.100> plate<00:01:50.369> comes<00:01:50.670> off<00:01:50.850> next<00:01:51.179> that's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the seal plate comes off next that's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:01.789 
the seal plate comes off next that's
just<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.049> pins<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.649> rest<00:01:52.890> here<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> here's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
just as for pins the rest here so here's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.310 
just as for pins the rest here so here's
where<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.009> put<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> o-ring

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.350 

and<00:02:05.800> there's<00:02:06.100> already<00:02:06.400> an<00:02:06.700> oil<00:02:06.820> seal<00:02:07.150> right

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
and there's already an oil seal right

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.730 
and there's already an oil seal right
here<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:07.870> this<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.050> sealed<00:02:08.380> part<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.680> the

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
here so this is sealed part of the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.690 
here so this is sealed part of the
system<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.450> our<00:02:10.450> o<00:02:10.509> ring<00:02:11.460> sits<00:02:12.460> on<00:02:12.610> top<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:13.000> it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
system and our o ring sits on top of it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.340 
system and our o ring sits on top of it
and<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:17.460> whoops

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.540 

different<00:02:22.350> mechanism<00:02:22.800> sits<00:02:23.040> right<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.250> top<00:02:23.370> of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
different mechanism sits right on top of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.980 
different mechanism sits right on top of
that<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.060> basically<00:02:24.360> we're<00:02:24.540> increasing<00:02:24.960> the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
that so basically we're increasing the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.230 
that so basically we're increasing the
space<00:02:25.670> there<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:28.380> motor<00:02:28.650> unit<00:02:28.830> rest<00:02:29.180> about<00:02:30.180> a

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
space there the motor unit rest about a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.020 
space there the motor unit rest about a
millimeter<00:02:30.690> further<00:02:30.930> outward<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:32.030> then

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
millimeter further outward and then

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.880 
millimeter further outward and then
design

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.950 

you<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.550> align<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.030> there's<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.390> pair<00:02:41.690> red

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
you can align this there's a pair red

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.320 
you can align this there's a pair red
dots<00:02:42.260> on<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.250> shifting<00:02:43.580> ring<00:02:43.819> there's<00:02:44.090> pair

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
dots on the shifting ring there's pair

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.240 
dots on the shifting ring there's pair
of<00:02:44.420> red<00:02:44.540> dots<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.990> this<00:02:45.110> initial<00:02:45.920> line<00:02:46.100> with

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
of red dots in this initial line with

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.690 
of red dots in this initial line with
each<00:02:46.370> other

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
each other

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.420 
each other
if<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.900> hub<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.380> first<00:02:48.650> gear<00:02:48.950> which<00:02:49.280> it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
if the hub is in first gear which it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.260 
if the hub is in first gear which it
should<00:02:49.640> be<00:02:50.200> for<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.380> service<00:02:51.590> it

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.700 

since<00:02:57.270> these<00:02:57.450> two<00:02:57.630> parts<00:02:57.900> rotate<00:02:58.350> against

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
since these two parts rotate against

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.040 
since these two parts rotate against
each<00:02:58.800> other<00:02:59.090> this<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> place<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.720> might<00:03:00.870> see

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
each other this is a place we might see

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.230 
each other this is a place we might see
somewhere<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.730> needs<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.030> tight

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
somewhere and this needs to be tight

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.240 
somewhere and this needs to be tight
enough<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> oil<00:03:03.750> doesn't<00:03:04.050> leak<00:03:04.200> out<00:03:04.380> too

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
enough the oil doesn't leak out too

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.220 
enough the oil doesn't leak out too
tight<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.420> won't<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:06.720> able<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.870> shift<00:03:07.050> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
tight and you won't be able to shift the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.070 
tight and you won't be able to shift the
hub<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:08.610> way<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.030> can<00:03:09.270> check<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.750> by<00:03:09.900> moving

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
hub so a way you can check is by moving

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.630 
hub so a way you can check is by moving
this<00:03:10.350> ring<00:03:10.620> by<00:03:10.770> hand<00:03:12.980> shifting<00:03:13.980> shifting<00:03:14.370> a

effort<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.450> hub<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.660> actually<00:03:16.020> pretty

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
effort on this hub is actually pretty

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.410 
effort on this hub is actually pretty
light<00:03:22.490> make<00:03:23.490> sure<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.760> leave<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.060> back<00:03:24.210> where

that's that this should be checked after
about<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.470> thousand<00:05:28.980> kilometers<00:05:31.160> per<00:05:32.160> day

great<00:05:33.170> continue<00:05:34.170> checking<00:05:34.380> it<00:05:34.560> when<00:05:34.650> you

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
great continue checking it when you

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.890 
great continue checking it when you
change<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.010> oil<00:05:35.190> that's<00:05:35.550> every<00:05:35.820> 5000<00:05:36.540> loners

change the oil that's every 5000 loners
brandish<00:05:37.350> mono<00:05:37.650> if<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:38.580> see<00:05:38.730> any<00:05:38.880> oil<00:05:38.910> leaks

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
brandish mono if you see any oil leaks

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.420 
brandish mono if you see any oil leaks
then<00:05:39.660> this<00:05:39.960> must<00:05:40.200> be<00:05:40.350> tightened<00:05:40.710> or<00:05:40.890> replaced

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
then this must be tightened or replaced

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.890 
then this must be tightened or replaced
and

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
and

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.530 
and
hopefully<00:05:43.290> it<00:05:43.350> works
