glass prior to inserting it into the jig
kit<00:02:29.550> you'll<00:02:29.880> get<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> stronger<00:02:30.480> bond<00:02:30.900> as<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
kit you'll get a stronger bond as the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.059 
kit you'll get a stronger bond as the
adhesive<00:02:31.890> around<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.060> digitizer<00:02:33.770> holds<00:02:34.770> best

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
adhesive around the digitizer holds best

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.590 
adhesive around the digitizer holds best
when<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.580> heated<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.000> about<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> hundred

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
when it's heated to about a hundred

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.790 
when it's heated to about a hundred
degrees<00:02:37.050> Fahrenheit<00:02:38.870> by<00:02:39.870> pressing<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.530> in

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
degrees Fahrenheit by pressing it in

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.750 
degrees Fahrenheit by pressing it in
here<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:42.360> forces<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.020> adhesive<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:44.250> contact

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
here this forces the adhesive to contact

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.050 
here this forces the adhesive to contact
the<00:02:44.970> metal<00:02:45.270> frame<00:02:46.250> all<00:02:47.250> around<00:02:47.760> the

circumference of the digitizer giving

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.000 
circumference of the digitizer giving
