hello<00:00:01.020> everyone<00:00:01.410> and<00:00:01.650> welcome<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.040> this

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hello everyone and welcome to this

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.590 
hello everyone and welcome to this
week's<00:00:02.520> video<00:00:02.700> today<00:00:03.240> I'm<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.480> be

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
week's video today I'm going to be

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.630 
week's video today I'm going to be
explaining<00:00:03.780> exhaust<00:00:04.470> systems<00:00:04.980> now<00:00:05.609> I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
explaining exhaust systems now I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.280 
explaining exhaust systems now I
previously<00:00:06.150> made<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.509> video<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.839> how<00:00:07.230> to

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
previously made a video on how to

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.839 
previously made a video on how to
increase<00:00:07.620> horsepower<00:00:07.859> with<00:00:08.370> your<00:00:08.550> exhaust

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
increase horsepower with your exhaust

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.370 
increase horsepower with your exhaust
and<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.599> was<00:00:09.690> brought<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:09.990> me<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.200> I

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
and it was brought up to me that I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.959 
and it was brought up to me that I
hadn't<00:00:10.620> really<00:00:10.769> explained<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.340> basics<00:00:11.820> of

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
hadn't really explained the basics of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.459 
hadn't really explained the basics of
exhaust<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.420> that's<00:00:12.570> what<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.809> video<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.170> for

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
exhaust so that's what this video is for

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.160 
exhaust so that's what this video is for
I'm<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> explain<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> basics<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.990> then

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I'm going to explain the basics and then

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.930 
I'm going to explain the basics and then
there's<00:00:16.440> some<00:00:16.590> other<00:00:16.710> things<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.279> I'll<00:00:17.699> say

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
there's some other things that I'll say

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.519 
there's some other things that I'll say
at<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> end<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.390> far<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.630> different<00:00:19.170> things

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
at the end as far as different things

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.290 
at the end as far as different things
about<00:00:19.980> exhaust<00:00:20.490> systems<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.119> won't

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
about exhaust systems that you won't

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.590 
about exhaust systems that you won't
look<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.609> basics<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.210> exhaust

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
look into so the very basics of exhaust

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300 
look into so the very basics of exhaust
of<00:00:24.840> course<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> last<00:00:25.710> stroke<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.250> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
of course it's the last stroke in a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.429 
of course it's the last stroke in a
four-stroke<00:00:26.760> engine<00:00:27.210> pushing<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.230> those

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
four-stroke engine pushing out those

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.679 
four-stroke engine pushing out those
exhaust<00:00:28.830> gases<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:30.029> need<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> leave

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
exhaust gases and you need them to leave

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.150 
exhaust gases and you need them to leave
and<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.019> only<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.650> kind<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.009> want<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and not only that you kind of want to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
and not only that you kind of want to
clean<00:00:32.340> them<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.270> don't<00:00:33.360> want<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
clean them up and you don't want it to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
clean them up and you don't want it to
be<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:33.989> loud<00:00:34.260> people<00:00:34.800> don't<00:00:34.980> typically

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
be really loud people don't typically

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.270 
be really loud people don't typically
enjoy<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:37.500> we've<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
enjoy that so what we've got here is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.380 
enjoy that so what we've got here is
here's<00:00:38.579> your<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.910> engine<00:00:39.180> block

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
here's your little engine block

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.810 
here's your little engine block
four-cylinder<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.010> you've<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.700> your

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
four-cylinder and you've got your

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
four-cylinder and you've got your
exhaust<00:00:42.120> manifold<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.410> exhaust

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
exhaust manifold so it at the exhaust

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
exhaust manifold so it at the exhaust
stroke<00:00:44.010> gets<00:00:44.250> me<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.879> pushing<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
stroke gets me going to be pushing the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
stroke gets me going to be pushing the
gasses<00:00:45.690> through<00:00:46.410> these<00:00:46.649> different<00:00:47.250> plenums

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
gasses through these different plenums

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.709 
gasses through these different plenums
here<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.450> exhaust<00:00:48.809> manifold<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.719> several

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
here in this exhaust manifold so several

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
here in this exhaust manifold so several
stages<00:00:52.050> along<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.590> way<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.280> we've<00:00:53.430> got

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
stages along the way first up we've got

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
stages along the way first up we've got
an<00:00:53.670> o2<00:00:53.820> sensor<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> be

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
an o2 sensor and that's going to be

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.010 
an o2 sensor and that's going to be
checking<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> air<00:00:56.129> fuel<00:00:56.370> ratio<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.780> your

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
checking the air fuel ratio so if your

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.630 
checking the air fuel ratio so if your
engine<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.500> burning<00:00:58.800> too<00:00:58.980> rich<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.309> too<00:00:59.370> lean

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
engine is burning too rich or too lean

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
engine is burning too rich or too lean
that's<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.469> kind<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> fix

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that's what this is here to kind of fix

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.280 
that's what this is here to kind of fix
for<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.600> sees<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> there's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
for you so if it sees that there's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.190 
for you so if it sees that there's
oxygen<00:01:04.890> still<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.119> exhaust<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
oxygen still in the exhaust then it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.899 
oxygen still in the exhaust then it
knows<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.710> burning<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> lean

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
knows that you're burning kind of lean

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.750 
knows that you're burning kind of lean
not<00:01:09.689> using<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.650> fuel<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.520> need

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
not using all of the fuel that you need

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
not using all of the fuel that you need
or<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.450> injecting<00:01:13.080> enough<00:01:13.260> fuel<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.979> then

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
or not injecting enough fuel so then

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
or not injecting enough fuel so then
your<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.729> engine<00:01:15.420> management<00:01:15.659> system<00:01:16.140> will

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
your your engine management system will

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
your your engine management system will
inject<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.740> fuel<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.570> vice-versa<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
inject more fuel and vice-versa if it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.660 
inject more fuel and vice-versa if it
sees<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.110> there's<00:01:19.290> no<00:01:19.439> oxygen<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.220> it'll

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
sees that there's no oxygen and it'll

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.320 
sees that there's no oxygen and it'll
say<00:01:20.790> hey<00:01:21.000> back<00:01:21.330> off<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.810> fuel<00:01:22.470> injection

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
say hey back off on the fuel injection

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.520 
say hey back off on the fuel injection
next<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.479> we've<00:01:24.659> got<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.869> catalytic<00:01:25.409> converter

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
next up we've got a catalytic converter

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.530 
next up we've got a catalytic converter
and<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.670> point<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> reduce

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and the point of this is to reduce

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.319 
and the point of this is to reduce
harmful<00:01:27.990> emissions<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.740> things<00:01:29.070> like

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
harmful emissions so things like

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.870 
harmful emissions so things like
nitrogen<00:01:30.329> oxides<00:01:30.750> carbon<00:01:31.290> monoxide<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide and the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.960 
nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide and the
vaporized<00:01:33.840> fuel<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.470> hydrocarbons<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
vaporized fuel the hydrocarbons that

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.260 
vaporized fuel the hydrocarbons that
have<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> haven't<00:01:38.040> burned<00:01:38.280> assuming

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
have that you haven't burned assuming

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.399 
have that you haven't burned assuming
you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.630> rich<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:40.049> something<00:01:40.290> like

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you know it's rich or something like

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.090 
you know it's rich or something like
that<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.540> we've<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.899> another<00:01:43.140> o2<00:01:43.680> sensor

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that so then we've got another o2 sensor

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
that so then we've got another o2 sensor
after<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> catalytic<00:01:44.909> converter<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.570> there

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
after a catalytic converter and there

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
after a catalytic converter and there
could<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.049> multiple<00:01:46.320> catalytic<00:01:47.040> converters

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
could be multiple catalytic converters

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
could be multiple catalytic converters
along<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:47.939> making<00:01:48.659> sure<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> clean

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
along the way making sure to clean

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.230 
along the way making sure to clean
everything<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.560> we've<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.670> another<00:01:50.880> o2

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
everything up we've got another o2

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
everything up we've got another o2
sensor<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.869> basically<00:01:52.380> checking<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
sensor this is basically checking the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190 
sensor this is basically checking the
efficiency<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.360> catalytic<00:01:54.869> converter

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
efficiency of this catalytic converter

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.870 
efficiency of this catalytic converter
and<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.799> will<00:01:55.920> make<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.159> sense<00:01:56.219> once<00:01:56.759> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and that will make more sense once you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
and that will make more sense once you
watch<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.210> video<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.509> catalytic<00:01:58.049> converters

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
watch my video on catalytic converters

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.639 
watch my video on catalytic converters
I'll<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> coming<00:02:00.149> weeks<00:02:00.649> next

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
I'll have that in the coming weeks next

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.130 
I'll have that in the coming weeks next
up<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.210> resonator<00:02:03.210> now<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.600> all<00:02:03.630> vehicles

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
up is a resonator now not all vehicles

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.749 
up is a resonator now not all vehicles
have<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> resonator<00:02:04.799> basically<00:02:05.549> these<00:02:05.700> are

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
have a resonator basically these are

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.730 
have a resonator basically these are
used<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.270> drown<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:07.259> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> specific

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
used to drown out kind of a specific

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.130 
used to drown out kind of a specific
p.m.<00:02:08.950> ranges<00:02:09.460> kind<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.390> like<00:02:10.480> cruise<00:02:10.750> speeds

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
p.m. ranges kind of like cruise speeds

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.780 
p.m. ranges kind of like cruise speeds
you<00:02:11.680> don't<00:02:11.830> want<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.220> be<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.460> highway

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you don't want to just be on the highway

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.700 
you don't want to just be on the highway
with<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.090> really<00:02:13.330> loud<00:02:13.480> noise<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.560> what

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
with this really loud noise and so what

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.320 
with this really loud noise and so what
this<00:02:14.830> does<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.100> you've<00:02:15.430> got<00:02:15.610> your<00:02:15.640> wave<00:02:15.970> length

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
this does is you've got your wave length

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.480 
this does is you've got your wave length
of<00:02:16.900> sound<00:02:17.170> coming<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.560> here<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.370> will

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
of sound coming in here and that will

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.100 
of sound coming in here and that will
break<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.390> as<00:02:19.540> they<00:02:19.690> bounce<00:02:19.900> back

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
break it up and as they bounce back

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.170 
break it up and as they bounce back
they'll<00:02:20.890> bounce<00:02:21.100> back<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.640> cancel<00:02:21.880> each

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
they'll bounce back and cancel each

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.830 
they'll bounce back and cancel each
other<00:02:22.330> out

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
other out

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.280 
other out
for<00:02:23.680> specific<00:02:24.460> ranges<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.690> then<00:02:25.960> finally

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
for specific ranges and then finally

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.620 
for specific ranges and then finally
we've<00:02:26.410> got<00:02:26.440> our<00:02:26.740> muffler<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.180> reduces

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
we've got our muffler this just reduces

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.810 
we've got our muffler this just reduces
noise<00:02:28.810> across<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.410> board<00:02:29.650> reduces<00:02:30.610> pretty

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
noise across the board reduces pretty

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.520 
noise across the board reduces pretty
much<00:02:30.970> all<00:02:31.120> frequencies<00:02:31.360> makes<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.350> little

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
much all frequencies makes a little

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.950 
much all frequencies makes a little
quieter<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.160> your<00:02:33.280> car's<00:02:33.490> not<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.850> loud<00:02:34.060> then

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
quieter so your car's not so loud then

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.500 
quieter so your car's not so loud then
it<00:02:35.080> all<00:02:35.170> goes<00:02:35.380> out<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.620> tailpipe<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:37.120> that's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
it all goes out the tailpipe so that's

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.510 
it all goes out the tailpipe so that's
the<00:02:37.690> basics<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.320> an<00:02:38.770> exhaust<00:02:39.070> I'm<00:02:39.310> going<00:02:39.460> to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
the basics of an exhaust I'm going to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760 
the basics of an exhaust I'm going to
have<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> video<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.000> two<00:02:40.540> sensors<00:02:40.960> catalytic

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
have a video on two sensors catalytic

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.860 
have a video on two sensors catalytic
converters<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.400> mufflers<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.600> can<00:02:43.720> get<00:02:43.840> a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
converters and mufflers so we can get a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.840 
converters and mufflers so we can get a
little<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:44.140> in-depth<00:02:44.500> into<00:02:44.740> those<00:02:45.040> I'm<00:02:45.370> also

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
little more in-depth into those I'm also

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.900 
little more in-depth into those I'm also
sure<00:02:46.450> clip<00:02:47.020> real<00:02:47.380> quick<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.220> my<00:02:48.430> car<00:02:48.700> and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
sure clip real quick just to my car and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.080 
sure clip real quick just to my car and
some<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.540> exhaust<00:02:49.810> parts<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.610> it's<00:02:51.850> kind

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
some of the exhaust parts so it's kind

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.490 
some of the exhaust parts so it's kind
of<00:02:52.150> hard<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.360> see<00:02:52.630> we've<00:02:52.900> got<00:02:53.050> this<00:02:53.260> heat

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
of hard to see we've got this heat

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.350 
of hard to see we've got this heat
shield<00:02:53.800> here<00:02:54.100> which<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.400> covering<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
shield here which is covering the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
shield here which is covering the
exhaust<00:02:55.720> manifold<00:02:56.370> which<00:02:57.370> then<00:02:57.610> goes<00:02:57.790> down

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
exhaust manifold which then goes down

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.300 
exhaust manifold which then goes down
underneath<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.620> car<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.890> can<00:03:03.130> follow

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
underneath the car and so you can follow

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.930 
underneath the car and so you can follow
that<00:03:03.610> back<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:05.140> there<00:03:05.290> you've<00:03:05.440> got<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
that back and there you've got the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.140 
that back and there you've got the
catalytic<00:03:06.940> converter<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:08.850> then<00:03:09.850> that's<00:03:10.060> just

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
catalytic converter and then that's just

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.810 
catalytic converter and then that's just
going<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.480> go<00:03:10.600> back<00:03:11.130> all<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.190> way<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.550> the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
going to go back all the way to the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.510 
going to go back all the way to the
muffler<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.860> here<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.160> course<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:15.490> have

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
muffler and so here of course we have

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.830 
muffler and so here of course we have
the<00:03:15.730> muffler<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.270> then<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.380> tailpipe
