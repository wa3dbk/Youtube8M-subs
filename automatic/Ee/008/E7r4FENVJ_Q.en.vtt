00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.170
 we turned it into a police station then 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.780
 the toast of by toutatis on the pn 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.309
 pointed in the bins on October 27th I 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.059
 cops who all during which one says 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.899
 an artist a genius so that's it and to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 reason gold this to bastille idea to the con 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:56.699
 you know the old ones the unknown part because 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.949
 that new strangers bros they we 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.190
 have not laughed what we are more 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.690
 known that parcels me I have the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.400
 mustache that beat me that is to say that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.670
 in the team we had to level lyrically in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.950
 made 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.440
 and every time it's punchline what it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:21.000
 it is necessary to be sensitive 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:23.460
 but is that the asking questions I 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 would do I track the dregs to various 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.060
 people actually in particular the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.700
 director the steering wheel that puts his wife 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
 in all my clips I do not know why 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.490
 it's for plane rocks in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.390
 assistance the director has by the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.650
 do not even call him 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.410
 the assistant there we have the frame actually 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.820
 it's a colossus that makes that when we 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.070
 tells him something too quickly in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.070
 do it more class alternation 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.280
 there is a good atmosphere on the set 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.670
 we can note the presence of flap case 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.690
 the only death of the wall because he 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.870
 still need a strict treat 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.210
 somewhere out there was a card you 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.470
 want the paris card is complained 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.470
 to have to have 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.240
 no to the basic agreement with the various 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.450
 in a circus place and at most 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:21.400
 great chances obviously here a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:30.520

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:34.630
 fifth follow me I write because is long 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.240

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.870
 of course there is diversity for all 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.510
 so that I do not know why 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.250
 by the way colleagues wanted to make a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.980
 decor actually legitimate and legal it's this 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.950

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.590
 grenades 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.450
 a sacred atmosphere at the shoot 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.020
 apparently we are waiting we are waiting for me 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.760

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.170
 he was complaining so here 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.980

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.980
