hotspot as well and we also have a
iPhone<00:02:38.230> case<00:02:39.030> same<00:02:40.030> idea<00:02:40.269> idea<00:02:40.900> here<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:41.349> also

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
iPhone case same idea idea here but also

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.289 
iPhone case same idea idea here but also
serves<00:02:41.859> as<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> battery<00:02:42.370> backup<00:02:42.549> as<00:02:42.819> well<00:02:42.849> so

you can get additional battery battery

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.399 
you can get additional battery battery
life<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.629> same<00:02:46.629> idea<00:02:46.780> turns<00:02:47.230> into<00:02:47.349> a

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
life on it so same idea turns into a

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.849 
life on it so same idea turns into a
hotspot<00:02:47.739> with<00:02:48.639> again<00:02:49.030> free<00:02:49.510> data<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.709> then

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
hotspot with again free data and then

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.500 
hotspot with again free data and then
these<00:02:50.980> are<00:02:51.040> for<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.340> home<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.639> assume<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.389> this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
these are for the home I assume and this

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.000 
these are for the home I assume and this
is<00:02:52.599> for<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.780> home<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.109> just<00:02:53.290> actually<00:02:53.650> started

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
is for the home we just actually started

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.589 
is for the home we just actually started
taking<00:02:54.099> pre-order<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.760> these<00:02:54.940> devices<00:02:55.420> a

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
taking pre-order on these devices a

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.259 
taking pre-order on these devices a
couple<00:02:56.230> weeks<00:02:56.379> ago<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:57.670> gonna<00:02:57.760> be<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:57.940> basic

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
couple weeks ago it's gonna be the basic

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.879 
couple weeks ago it's gonna be the basic
plan<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:58.930> we've<00:02:59.049> had<00:02:59.139> a<00:02:59.200> lot<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.379> success<00:02:59.739> on

plan so we've had a lot of success on

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.050 
plan so we've had a lot of success on
these<00:03:00.010> devices<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.459> been<00:03:00.579> out<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.790> market

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
these devices and been out on the market

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.949 
these devices and been out on the market
since<00:03:01.209> October<00:03:01.599> first

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959
