00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 and well hi to all his subscribers I you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.009
 found today for a video 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.360
 recruitment again this is the second 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.279
 on my channel simply because 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.210
 my team to a section that comes from 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.949
 to orient oneself competently 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.170
 there was not very long 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 started the competition with a few 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 members actually we are just the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.500
 best 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.019
 without wanting too much compared 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 to others and that's how we started 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.009
 the competition we started the lmp 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 all this and we realize that we are 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.489
 more so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.120
 hence the title of this video and its 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.379
 recruitment of the competitive team 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 so I will address several points 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.430
 in particular the admission criteria which 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 are still there the most 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.539
 important in the video for me but 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.579
 I will also give you a small 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.739
 description of what we do 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.260
 workouts and all that so for 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.199
 start one is on modern warfare 3 and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.899
 black ops from the suite 'team section 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.149
 classic section fun section I play 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 a lot about black ops 2 while we 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 the complete have done exclusively on 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.920
 modern warfare 3 for now all 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.420
 just because it's a game we 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
 really really mastery we know the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.930
 mobs like our pocket even if black ops 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.640
 from it starts to chaumont well so 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 but amman doing too much we really 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.070
 a lot easier we are completely 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.189
 and already badens are very big 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.360
 reassure I know that for you there is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.780
 two in the complete section that have 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.090
 not a lot of luck or the rookie to him 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 1 35 and the desk at 1.60 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.810
 but you look at their ration 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.490
 weekly ie since since 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 some time and well some time 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 they are already really improved by 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 compared to their ratios they have a little 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.659
 messed up at first look at the ration 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.610
 weekly is low we have all 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.470
 cases all 5 above love 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.119
 I think I'm in the 50's help 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.950
 personally so here is online we have 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.659
 really no problem we have super easy 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.009
 and when it comes to going in full 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.360
 and well it's really a plus after he 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.280
 must reflexes must here must 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 john rocket jump shot and all by the way 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.250
 for that if you have a burn really 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.960
 really a plus so I just talked 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 from me in my chair block like 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.829
 that's more or less clear although the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.989
 fun section of the team game also on 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.210
 a hell 3 and that we are considering 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.270
 can be start the company 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.440
 on black ops of itie the discord the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.960
 Christmas game will come a little 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.370
 drinking because we do not support too much 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.750
 this game given the connections that 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.460
 are happily some times lucky 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.870
 stuff that annoys me all the time I 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.670
 am shooting the first one on 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.740
 first on the enemy all the time I the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.270
 drop shot the jump shot and go nothing to 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.600
 do I die is this one thing that 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.130
 get angry 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.410
 well, well, I'm not here to make a 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.390
 blow of mouth on cause 2 so as 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.790
 I say them for the rest timba we have two 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.700
 sections just like that that 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.810
 allows to be more numerous when we 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.700
 do not compete I all 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.050
 together and that's more I find 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.210
 it's more fun personally 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.800
 to have a complete team like 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.400
 many pros the bottom to timone 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.620
 mythix have soiled his action of 4 so 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.300
 this is just the purpose of this 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.900
 competitive section and not to redo a 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.630
 small my share so the goal of our team 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.800
 complete to us is to be between 6 and 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.600
 8 we are already 4 5 with a wind that does not 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.060
 connect more enormously these times 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.510
 so we're going to count on having four so 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.420
 four seats maximum 8 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.480
 it may sound like a lot but there are 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.830
 matches being played for the moment 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.850
 only on the aisne pays so it's from 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.410
 1-4 c on and that's it eight 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.000
 would not be bad and in time 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.870
 when there are always unforeseen 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.310
 will always have one or the other that must 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.600
 go right to left that has to go 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.040
 with the family that welcomes 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.150
 planned or that 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.230
 so that in the end and well we are not 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.910
 never enough to launch the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.830
 compet and leave us to be 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.910
 connected for example to 6 at the same time 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.350
 and who is there and four who leave in 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.940
 competes and will pass the four who are the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.020
 hottest of the day that breaks it 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.550
 there is no concern about his 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.440
 supports have alternated everything and that's it 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.480
 cool and then at worst at worst honestly 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.980
 we can register during matches 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.970
 complete simultaneously if the mines are 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.430
 connected so I spoke to you a lot 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.450
 from the suite of the complete section 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.240
 and the classic section 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.680
 I invite you to see 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.510
 my other video that is recruiting 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.020
 from following sections a section 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.880
 classical 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.680
 that's just if you want 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.050
 eventually join the team but 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.280
 not in competition section then at 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.400
 level of conditions this is what 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.500
 is more important in the video does not want 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.270
 not to say that I require but almost a 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.780
 connection a day because that's it 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.250
 good looking d 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.860
 in a complete section but if we 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.900
 play on saturday sunday and wednesday 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.480
 it's shocking unless you play 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.400
 really really these players there it's 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.950
 still quite often but in the week 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.230
 it's really advisable to play a 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.800
 some time then at the ratio level 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.940
 I would say minimum 2 but 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.139
 as I wanted to say we do not have 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.730
 necessarily general ratios of 2 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.510
 so as said by the way in the 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.000
 previous video 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.590
 if you do not have a ratio you will have to 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.500
 prove to me that you are able to 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.000
 easily do online ie 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.669
 online here are all our players 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.140
 I'll say it happens it happens 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.400
 flour part in clothes it happens 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.450
 once a day losing my search 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.610
 and destruction because we make 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.470
 shit but there's no problem at this 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.080
 level there but otherwise usually we 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.229
 is between two and I would say 5/10 of 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.030
 ratio what so here I would say ratio 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.500
 but if you are able to make us 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.180
 more shown in your plate of 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.270
 Madeira and the training that you are 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.100
 really balèze I would also say 15 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.900
 years minimum because it takes a minimum 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.880
 of maturity for the competition we do not 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.890
 do not do anything there are rules 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.270
 to respect and in particular rules 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.430
 level of rabies one can not 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.229
 start raging here is being killed by 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.840
 a guy we're going to insult him we plug the 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.400
 micro your choices here are your camp and 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.220
 used such weapons we do not care 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.729
 competition without getting excited by 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.720
 cui a serious one we do what we want 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.550
 to win a research round and 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.050
 destruction you stay at 4 fixed sights 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.310
 on purpose if you have to do it 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.600
 your technique but the goal is to 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.970
 winning in competition must be that 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.810
 it's clear directly even before 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.880
 post this message 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.140
 here it is clear played with this 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.229
 we want we do what we want 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.440
 the goal is to gain point bar so I 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.880
 think this video all is coming to an end 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.800
 listen I think you were more or 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.180
 less announced if there are things of 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.650
 things matters you'll still have to 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.630
 to ask me do not hesitate in the space of 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.460
 comments or by private message I 'm there 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.620
 answer and there you go and I will guide you 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.630
 a little bit of duty 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.370
 answers for a possible 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.930
 recruitment of tests and all because 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.220
 that we will make them date is still 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.990
 of course that's for sure and certain 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.610
 tests may not last an hour 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.420
 or two it may be easily 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.940
 a few days so be ready and 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.680
 respect these conditions so listen 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.940
 I will leave you there and I hope 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.550
 that you will be many as in the 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.250
 video recruitment of the suite sim 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.980
 classic to leave me comments 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.380
 and that's why not subscribe everything 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.170
 that and tell me that you are interested 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.580
 I would really like it 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.190
 I repeat one last time that there is 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.210
 than four places so the first ones the 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.780
 first come first 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.240
 served 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.540
