00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.240
Hi Everyone! Kristina here. I thought I take
a break from my Holiday cards and show you

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.520
guys a quick haul from JetPens.com. I love
JetPens. I love anything to do with stationary

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.520
and pens and paper and ink and just writing.
I love all that stuff. So, JetPens contacted

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.930
me and allowed me to go on a little shopping
spree for about $25 for a couple months and

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.230
see what I bought. Ant then I'm here to share
with you what I found and these are really

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.950
fun items. So, the first thing I did was I
got a refill for my favorite white correction

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.690
tape. I love this thing like you would not
believe. It's awesome. I love that when I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.430
put it down I can hold it in my hand like
this and just put the line down. Let me show

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.930
you an example. You can just put it down like
this and the line comes out nice and white.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.140
I like that it goes down really smooth and
it lays really flat and I'm able to write

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.890
over the top of it. As long as the pen isn't
too scratchy it does just fine. So I really

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.890
really love this particular white correction
tape and then also the refill. So I've been

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.090
using that in my planner. And I have also
been using these like velum sticky notes.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.409
They're really kind of cool. You can see through
them onto whatever you're leaving a note on

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.070
and I just think it's really neat. So I use
these a little bit for kind of mapping out

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.479
or planning projects that I don't want to
have permanent in my planner just yet. I like

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.119
to put these down and then I can sort of get
an idea of what I'm going to be doing. Also

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.040
for my planner I got these 2 rolls of stickers.
And these are really interesting in that they

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.369
have different designs on them and the edges
have like a design on them. So let me show

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.250
you what I mean. You can unroll them. It's
like one sticker and they stay together like

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.270
this, but you can tear them apart so that
you can use all the different designs in your

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.959
planners, or your projects, your school things.
These are just fun labels. I have this one

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.709
that has different bears, different little
faces on the bears and then this one has a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.290
cat and a pig and I think it has a couple
of other animals. I haven't opened this one

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.689
quite yet. But I have been using these they are
super cute and fun in my planner. So I thought

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:32.430
I would just share those with you guys. These
are so super fun and I love that they change

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.599
the different designs as you roll them out.
The last thing I wanted to show you was these

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.540
really cool pens. I'm not sure how exactly
to pronounce it. Fudebiyori, Fudebiyori Metallic...maybe...I'm

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.029
not entirely sure. But these markers are really
cool. They show up extremely well on black

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:56.059
cardstock so if you wanted address envelopes
or something like that. I particularly love

00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:03.059
the silver, copper and also the gold. I think
all 3 of those look amazing. The green metallic

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.129
is really really prretty as well. So I thought
I would just show you how awesome they are.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.809
I'm gonna start with the green metallic over
here. And they are a brush pen, so you could

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.569
have the thicks and thins. So...

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.589
just like that. Sorry I had to stop talking
while I was thinking. So green metallic.

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:49.209
I think they are super cool. They come in
a lot of different colors. In fact they have

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.909
ones that aren't metallic which I don't know
they would show up on dark cardstock, but

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.949
they are really cool looking. So, I'll just
write my name here.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.419
I think they're so nice and they have a really
good flow to them. They have enough friction

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.740
on the cardstock that I feel like I have more
control while I'm writing. As opposed to if

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.949
it was too slick you might not have enough
control. So, maybe I'll just write JetPens

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.269
over here.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.419
I think they're super super pretty. So, you  can buy these as a set, like I did, or you can get

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.430
them individually. If I was to get them individually,
like I set before, I would get the copper

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.319
and silver and the gold for sure and also
consider the green and well, I don't know

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.930
they're all really good. I don't know if actually
really narrow it down. These really stand

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.610
out to me on dark cardstock. In fact you know, I haven't
really even tried it on white, so maybe I'll just

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.610
grab some white cardstock over here somewhere.
And I'll just try this purple on white.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.780
Super vibrant.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.120
I think they're so fun. You can kind of see
a little bit of that metalllic. These definately

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.120
have more control then the Wink of Luna pens. Just because The Wink of Luna pens really is an actual

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.000
brush. These have a brush tip which is similar
but not the same. Like these are, it's like

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.840
your regular brush tip that you would find
on like a marker. So it's really kind of cool.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.240
You can get some really thin, thins and some
thick lines. Really cool. So of all the things

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.499
I bought the last couple of months these are
super fun and I've been enjoying addressing

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:50.800
different envelopes for cards that I send
to friends and family. So I hope you will

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.800
check those out. Just to recap I have the
sticky memos. I also I have the different

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.169
sticker tapes. Stick that one back on so I
can use it a little bit later. And I also

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:10.169
have the correction tape and the refill. These
are my favorite JetPen finds recently. So,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.499
go over to JetPens.com. I love shopping there
because they have great shipping prices and

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:23.499
also if, I think if you're within the United
States you get free shipping after $25, so

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:29.419
I could easily reach that point no problem.
So I hope you guys enjoyed today's video and

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:33.160
I'll catch you guys tomorrow for Day 5 of
the Holiday Card Series. Thanks for watching.
