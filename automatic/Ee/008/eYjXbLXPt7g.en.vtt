major bowing or cracking you might see a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.830 
major bowing or cracking you might see a
horizontal<00:00:16.740> crack<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:17.699> ten<00:00:18.390> or<00:00:18.480> fifteen<00:00:18.810> feet

from<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.320> corner<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> got<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> crack<00:00:20.310> that's

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
from a corner and you got a crack that's

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.730 
from a corner and you got a crack that's
very<00:00:20.789> very<00:00:20.939> narrow<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> bottom<00:00:22.020> half<00:00:22.529> an

inch wide or so at the top you look down

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410 
inch wide or so at the top you look down
the<00:00:25.529> other<00:00:25.680> side<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.250> corner<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.000> you're

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the other side of that corner and you're

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.580 
the other side of that corner and you're
probably<00:00:27.539> gonna<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> crack<00:00:28.230> looks<00:00:28.439> just

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
probably gonna see a crack looks just

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
probably gonna see a crack looks just
like<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.039> structure<00:00:29.699> could<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.029> some<00:00:30.269> if

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
like it structure could have some if

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.560 
like it structure could have some if
you've<00:00:31.019> got<00:00:31.320> sagging<00:00:31.859> floors<00:00:32.189> upstairs<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:33.329> if

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
closing hard you may want to start

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
closing hard you may want to start
thinking<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.500> looking<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.950> basement

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
thinking about looking in the basement

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.950 
thinking about looking in the basement
and<00:00:38.520> making<00:00:38.730> sure<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> there's<00:00:39.239> no<00:00:39.420> problems

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and making sure that there's no problems

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.360 
and making sure that there's no problems
going<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:40.920> there's<00:00:41.160> any

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
going on there and if there's any

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
going on there and if there's any
excessive<00:00:42.090> cracking<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.750> movement<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.440> us

excessive cracking or movement get us
out<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.920> take<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:45.210> you've<00:00:45.360> got
