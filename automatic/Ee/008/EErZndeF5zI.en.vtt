00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
to improve the quality of your indirect

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.330 
to improve the quality of your indirect
lighting<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:07.109> can<00:00:07.140> actually<00:00:07.710> use<00:00:07.950> both

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
lighting you can actually use both

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.790 
lighting you can actually use both
global<00:00:08.940> illumination<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.900> final<00:00:10.500> gathering

techniques at the same time within a
single<00:00:12.719> scene<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.309> help<00:00:14.580> deal<00:00:14.940> with

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
single scene and this can help deal with

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.330 
single scene and this can help deal with
some<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.570> quality<00:00:15.929> issues<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.560> most<00:00:17.010> types

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
some of the quality issues of most types

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
some of the quality issues of most types
of<00:00:17.490> indirect<00:00:17.880> lighting<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> could<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
of indirect lighting so I could just

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.960 
of indirect lighting so I could just
show<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.619> quickly<00:00:19.949> how<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.400> set<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.910> up

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
show you quickly how you can set this up

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
show you quickly how you can set this up
I'm<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.630> my<00:00:21.810> simple<00:00:22.020> room<00:00:22.320> scene<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> press

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
I'm in my simple room scene and press

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.740 
I'm in my simple room scene and press
five<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.550> switch<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.910> shaded<00:00:24.150> mode<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.630> can

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
five to switch to shaded mode you can

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
five to switch to shaded mode you can
see<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.080> my<00:00:25.230> land<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.609> three

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
see I have my land here in my three

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
see I have my land here in my three
simple<00:00:27.150> shapes<00:00:27.619> so<00:00:28.619> I'll<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> quick<00:00:29.189> render

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
simple shapes so I'll do a quick render

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
simple shapes so I'll do a quick render
here<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.689> looks<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
here to see what this looks like the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.000 
here to see what this looks like the
lamp<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.550> using<00:00:32.850> an<00:00:32.969> area<00:00:33.360> light<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.530> shape<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
lamp is using an area light the shape of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
lamp is using an area light the shape of
the<00:00:35.160> area<00:00:35.430> light<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.760> set<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.180> sphere<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.230> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the area light is set to sphere so that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
the area light is set to sphere so that
the<00:00:37.500> area<00:00:37.800> light<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.160> casting<00:00:38.640> nice<00:00:38.850> soft

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the area light is casting nice soft

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.760 
the area light is casting nice soft
shadows<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.030> here

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
shadows and you can see this right here

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.260 
shadows and you can see this right here
so<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> softness<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.309> shadows<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> created

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
so the softness and shadows is created

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
so the softness and shadows is created
by<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> area<00:00:45.750> light<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.530> also<00:00:46.680> coming

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
by the area light and it's also coming

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.560 
by the area light and it's also coming
through<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> lampshade<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.420> bit

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
through the lampshade just a little bit

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
through the lampshade just a little bit
so<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> add<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:50.100> indirect

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
so now I want to add some indirect

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.189 
so now I want to add some indirect
lighting<00:00:50.789> into<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> room<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> light

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
lighting into the room so that the light

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.869 
lighting into the room so that the light
coming<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.949> lamp<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.430> bouncing

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
coming out of the lamp is bouncing

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.250 
coming out of the lamp is bouncing
around<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.510> start<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> other

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
around and we can start to see the other

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
around and we can start to see the other
objects<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> room<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.370> I'll<00:00:56.489> store<00:00:56.789> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
objects in the room so I'll store this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.220 
objects in the room so I'll store this
really<00:00:57.210> quickly<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.629> I'll<00:00:57.750> start<00:00:58.020> by

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
really quickly and I'll start by

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
really quickly and I'll start by
creating<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> point<00:00:59.010> light<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.699> will<00:00:59.820> emit

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
creating the point light that will emit

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
creating the point light that will emit
photons<00:01:01.100> essentially<00:01:02.100> global<00:01:02.489> illumination

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
photons essentially global illumination

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
photons essentially global illumination
so<00:01:03.329> I'll<00:01:03.629> switch<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> wireframe<00:01:04.320> view<00:01:04.680> by

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so I'll switch to the wireframe view by

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.240 
so I'll switch to the wireframe view by
pressing<00:01:05.070> four<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.560> pull<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.710> over<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
pressing four and pull this over so that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.789 
pressing four and pull this over so that
it's<00:01:08.520> basically<00:01:09.240> inside<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:10.049> lamp<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.710> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it's basically inside my lamp I want to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's basically inside my lamp I want to
switch<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> top<00:01:11.490> view<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.799> position<00:01:13.799> this

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
switch to the top view and position this

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.730 
switch to the top view and position this
right<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> that's<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> center<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
right here so that's at the center of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.550 
right here so that's at the center of
the<00:01:16.799> lamp<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.220> I'll<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:17.850> back<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.560> camera

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the lamp and I'll go back to the camera

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.310 
the lamp and I'll go back to the camera
one<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.450> tuck<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> lampshade<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
one and tuck it in the lampshade and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.469 
one and tuck it in the lampshade and
that's<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:22.680> good<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.360> my

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that's pretty good so now that I have my

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.060 
that's pretty good so now that I have my
point<00:01:24.750> light<00:01:24.930> I'll<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.290> call<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.619> photon

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
point light I'll just call this photon

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
point light I'll just call this photon
caster<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.960> doing<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
caster so we know what it's doing and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.280 
caster so we know what it's doing and
I'll<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> oton<00:01:29.729> caster<00:01:30.299> shape<00:01:30.720> node<00:01:31.049> in

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
I'll go to the oton caster shape node in

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
I'll go to the oton caster shape node in
the<00:01:31.590> attribute<00:01:32.040> editor<00:01:32.159> by<00:01:32.640> clicking<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the attribute editor by clicking on this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
the attribute editor by clicking on this
tab<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> I'm<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> turn<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.920> emit

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
tab and I'm going to turn on emit

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.609 
tab and I'm going to turn on emit
photons<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> default<00:01:36.960> setting<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.590> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
photons this is a default setting so I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
photons this is a default setting so I
have<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.890> photon<00:01:38.250> color<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.820> intensity<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
have my photon color the intensity and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
have my photon color the intensity and
the<00:01:39.509> exponent<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.170> default<00:01:40.530> settings<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the exponent or all default settings you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.499 
the exponent or all default settings you
notice<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> can't<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> number<00:01:42.479> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
notice I can't get to the number of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.499 
notice I can't get to the number of
photons<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:43.229> order<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.280> make<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.759> active<00:01:45.299> for

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
photons in order to make this active for

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
photons in order to make this active for
some<00:01:45.659> reason<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> turn<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.829> global

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
some reason you have to turn on global

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.550 
some reason you have to turn on global
illumination<00:01:47.399> first<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.630> I'll<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
illumination first so I'll go to the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
illumination first so I'll go to the
render<00:01:49.829> settings<00:01:50.070> window<00:01:50.759> click<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
render settings window click on the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.810 
render settings window click on the
indirect<00:01:51.810> lighting<00:01:51.899> tab<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.770> turn<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.399> global

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
indirect lighting tab and turn on global

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.580 
indirect lighting tab and turn on global
illumination<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.409> these

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
illumination so now I have these

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.319 
illumination so now I have these
settings<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.159> these<00:01:56.310> settings<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.850> once

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
settings in these settings and once

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.060 
settings in these settings and once
again<00:01:57.450> sometimes<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.200> turn<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.530> off<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
again sometimes if you turn this off and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
again sometimes if you turn this off and
turn<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.610> again<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:00.719> global

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
turn it on again now I have my global

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.170 
turn it on again now I have my global
illumination<00:02:01.290> photons<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.549> available<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
illumination photons are available and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.459 
illumination photons are available and
to<00:02:03.450> boost<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.380> hundred

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
to boost this up to about a hundred

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.370 
to boost this up to about a hundred
thousand

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.820 

and<00:02:08.820> create<00:02:09.820> another<00:02:10.090> render<00:02:10.480> know<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> couple

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
and create another render know a couple

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.080 
and create another render know a couple
things<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.460> want<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.700> make<00:02:12.820> sure<00:02:12.850> that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
things that you want to make sure that

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.640 
things that you want to make sure that
you<00:02:13.210> don't<00:02:13.420> forget<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.930> need<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.320> set<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
you don't forget I need to set the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.440 
you don't forget I need to set the
intensity<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.340> zero<00:02:15.730> because<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.150> don't<00:02:16.330> want

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
intensity to zero because I don't want

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.570 
intensity to zero because I don't want
this<00:02:16.540> shedding<00:02:17.050> any<00:02:17.200> direct<00:02:17.740> lighting<00:02:18.160> so

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
this shedding any direct lighting so

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.460 
this shedding any direct lighting so
that<00:02:18.610> should<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:18.940> zero<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.660> all<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.050> light<00:02:20.290> is

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
that should be zero so all this light is

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.620 
that should be zero so all this light is
doing<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.950> emitting<00:02:21.340> photons<00:02:21.520> into<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.390> scene

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
doing is emitting photons into the scene

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.530 
doing is emitting photons into the scene
no<00:02:23.350> direct<00:02:23.740> lighting<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.060> let's<00:02:25.300> create

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
no direct lighting so let's create

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.280 
no direct lighting so let's create
another<00:02:25.630> test<00:02:26.200> render<00:02:27.600> let<00:02:28.600> me<00:02:28.690> store<00:02:28.960> that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
another test render let me store that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.200 
another test render let me store that
it's<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.950> little<00:02:30.160> bit<00:02:30.250> blotchy<00:02:30.520> as<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.910> can<00:02:31.030> see

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
it's a little bit blotchy as you can see

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.970 
it's a little bit blotchy as you can see
and<00:02:31.510> some<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.020> is<00:02:32.200> somewhat<00:02:32.530> blown<00:02:32.800> out

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
and some of this is somewhat blown out

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.190 
and some of this is somewhat blown out
so<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.730> couple<00:02:34.000> things<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.300> can<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.810> fix<00:02:35.020> that

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
so a couple things I can do to fix that

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.620 
so a couple things I can do to fix that
problem<00:02:35.680> I'm<00:02:36.460> going<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.670> reduce<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.270> scale<00:02:37.600> a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
problem I'm going to reduce the scale a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.810 
problem I'm going to reduce the scale a
little<00:02:37.810> bit<00:02:38.200> bring<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.770> down<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.520> it's<00:02:39.670> not

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
little bit bring this down so it's not

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.520 
little bit bring this down so it's not
making<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.540> much<00:02:40.660> brightness<00:02:40.990> in<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.350> room

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
making so much brightness in the room

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.800 
making so much brightness in the room
and<00:02:41.770> I'm<00:02:42.490> going<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.670> improve<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.150> accuracy<00:02:43.540> of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and I'm going to improve the accuracy of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
and I'm going to improve the accuracy of
the<00:02:44.110> global<00:02:44.470> illumination<00:02:44.650> I'll<00:02:45.280> set<00:02:45.490> this<00:02:45.610> up

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the global illumination I'll set this up

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.080 
the global illumination I'll set this up
to<00:02:45.940> 1500<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:48.550> another<00:02:48.940> test<00:02:49.300> render<00:02:51.090> so

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
to 1500 and do another test render so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.820 
to 1500 and do another test render so
this<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.450> what<00:02:52.600> we<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:52.840> looks<00:02:53.320> better<00:02:53.530> in

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
this is what we get looks better in

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.950 
this is what we get looks better in
terms<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.160> its<00:02:54.310> less<00:02:54.610> blotchy<00:02:55.000> but<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.840> can

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
terms of its less blotchy but you can

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.630 
terms of its less blotchy but you can
see<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.350> sphere<00:02:56.680> here<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.040> still<00:02:57.280> have

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
see on the sphere here we still have

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.120 
see on the sphere here we still have
some<00:02:57.910> blotchiness<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.230> green<00:02:59.440> color<00:02:59.740> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
some blotchiness in the green color the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.520 
some blotchiness in the green color the
quality<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.700> shadow<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.270> course<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:02.290> can

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
quality of the shadow of course this can

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.710 
quality of the shadow of course this can
be<00:03:02.560> improved<00:03:03.040> by<00:03:03.160> adjusting<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.180> sampling

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
be improved by adjusting the sampling

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.630 
be improved by adjusting the sampling
setting<00:03:05.080> on<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.560> area<00:03:05.920> light<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.430> I'm<00:03:06.520> going

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
setting on the area light and I'm going

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.010 
setting on the area light and I'm going
to<00:03:06.670> leave<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:06.850> alone<00:03:07.000> for<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:07.630> just

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
to leave that alone for right now just

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.360 
to leave that alone for right now just
so<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.200> know<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.620> doesn't<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:09.130> anything

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
so you know this doesn't have anything

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.520 
so you know this doesn't have anything
to<00:03:09.640> do<00:03:09.850> with<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.390> indirect<00:03:10.840> lighting<00:03:10.930> setting

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
to do with the indirect lighting setting

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.860 
to do with the indirect lighting setting
so<00:03:11.650> that's<00:03:11.770> all<00:03:12.100> based<00:03:12.880> on<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.240> area<00:03:13.690> light

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
so that's all based on the area light

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.410 
so that's all based on the area light
sampling<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:14.710> I'll<00:03:14.800> save<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.070> image<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.940> now

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
sampling so I'll save that image and now

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.460 
sampling so I'll save that image and now
what<00:03:16.630> I'm<00:03:16.720> going<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> do<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.140> I'm<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.320> to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.510 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
turn<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.830> final<00:03:18.520> gathering<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.560> scroll<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
turn on final gathering so scroll in the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.770 
turn on final gathering so scroll in the

indirect lighting tab down to final
gathering<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.360> I'll<00:03:26.110> turn<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.710> and<00:03:26.950> I'd

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
gathering and I'll turn this on and I'd

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.690 
gathering and I'll turn this on and I'd
like<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.380> increase<00:03:29.380> my<00:03:29.620> secondary<00:03:30.220> diffuse

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
like to increase my secondary diffuse

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.450 
like to increase my secondary diffuse
balances<00:03:31.240> so<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.390> we<00:03:31.690> get<00:03:31.870> more<00:03:32.250> bounces<00:03:33.250> out

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
balances so that we get more bounces out

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.040 
balances so that we get more bounces out
of<00:03:33.490> our<00:03:33.700> indirect<00:03:34.090> lighting<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.720> I'm<00:03:34.840> going<00:03:34.990> to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
of our indirect lighting so I'm going to

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.690 
of our indirect lighting so I'm going to
set<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.380> up<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.710> one<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:38.250> store<00:03:39.250> this<00:03:39.400> image

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
set this up to one and store this image

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.520 
set this up to one and store this image
and<00:03:39.970> create<00:03:40.450> another<00:03:40.690> render<00:03:41.050> now<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.380> one

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
and create another render now this one

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.080 
and create another render now this one
will<00:03:41.740> take<00:03:41.980> longer<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:42.550> see<00:03:42.790> if<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.060> actually

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
will take longer but see if it actually

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.000 
will take longer but see if it actually
helps<00:03:43.780> deal<00:03:44.110> with<00:03:44.260> some<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.590> blotchiness

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
helps deal with some of the blotchiness

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.360 
helps deal with some of the blotchiness
on<00:03:45.370> this<00:03:45.580> green<00:03:45.910> sphere<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.890> now<00:03:50.980> we<00:03:51.070> have<00:03:51.250> our

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
on this green sphere so now we have our

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.100 
on this green sphere so now we have our
render<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.730> complete<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.570> can<00:03:52.720> see<00:03:52.900> that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
render is complete and you can see that

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.080 
render is complete and you can see that
some<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.500> problems<00:03:53.710> on<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.010> sphere<00:03:54.460> have

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
some of the problems on the sphere have

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.120 
some of the problems on the sphere have
been<00:03:55.270> alleviated<00:03:55.570> just<00:03:56.110> by<00:03:56.260> turning<00:03:56.320> on<00:03:56.800> final

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
been alleviated just by turning on final

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.580 
been alleviated just by turning on final
gathering<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.910> store<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.140> compare<00:03:59.410> with

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
gathering I store this and compare with

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.310 
gathering I store this and compare with
the<00:03:59.710> previous<00:04:00.070> render<00:04:00.460> you<00:04:01.180> can<00:04:01.360> see<00:04:01.570> this<00:04:02.080> is

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
the previous render you can see this is

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.100 
the previous render you can see this is
what<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.500> get<00:04:03.270> so<00:04:04.270> there<00:04:04.450> we<00:04:04.570> have<00:04:04.750> fairly

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
what I get so there we have fairly

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.500 
what I get so there we have fairly
blotchy<00:04:05.500> coloring<00:04:06.340> on<00:04:06.460> the<00:04:06.580> sphere<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.420> now

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
blotchy coloring on the sphere and now

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.820 
blotchy coloring on the sphere and now
some<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:07.960> those<00:04:08.080> problems<00:04:08.470> have<00:04:08.500> gone<00:04:08.680> away

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
some of those problems have gone away

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.400 
some of those problems have gone away
and<00:04:09.160> we've<00:04:10.120> proved<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.600> image<00:04:10.810> quality<00:04:10.960> and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
and we've proved the image quality and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.650 
and we've proved the image quality and
this<00:04:11.770> is<00:04:11.950> with<00:04:12.070> using<00:04:12.250> fairly<00:04:12.790> low<00:04:13.060> final

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
this is with using fairly low final

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.480 
this is with using fairly low final
gathering<00:04:13.990> settings<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:14.920> if<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.040> store<00:04:15.310> this

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
gathering settings so if I store this

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.280 
gathering settings so if I store this
image<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.060> just<00:04:16.270> as<00:04:16.419> an<00:04:16.510> experiment

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
image and just as an experiment

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.159 
image and just as an experiment
turn<00:04:17.830> off<00:04:18.070> global<00:04:18.669> illumination<00:04:18.930> let's<00:04:19.930> see

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
turn off global illumination let's see

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.509 
turn off global illumination let's see
how<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.799> looks<00:04:21.070> with

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
how it looks with

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.339 
how it looks with
just<00:04:21.699> final<00:04:22.180> gathering<00:04:22.629> and<00:04:22.780> no<00:04:22.900> global

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
just final gathering and no global

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.680 
just final gathering and no global
illumination<00:04:26.639> so<00:04:27.639> this<00:04:27.849> is<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> render<00:04:28.419> with

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
illumination so this is the render with

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.960 
illumination so this is the render with
just<00:04:29.139> final<00:04:29.770> gathering<00:04:30.099> settings<00:04:30.520> put<00:04:30.699> on<00:04:30.819> you

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
just final gathering settings put on you

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.700 
just final gathering settings put on you
can<00:04:31.060> see<00:04:31.270> I'm<00:04:31.360> getting<00:04:31.599> some<00:04:31.780> strange<00:04:32.110> green

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
can see I'm getting some strange green

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.189 
can see I'm getting some strange green
glowing<00:04:33.190> down<00:04:33.520> here<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.629> you<00:04:34.720> can<00:04:34.840> see<00:04:34.990> how

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
glowing down here so you can see how

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.050 
glowing down here so you can see how
using<00:04:35.620> them<00:04:35.770> both<00:04:36.039> together<00:04:36.370> at<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:36.879> same

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
using them both together at the same

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.629 
using them both together at the same
time<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.659> a<00:04:37.750> scene<00:04:38.050> can<00:04:38.710> help<00:04:38.949> create<00:04:39.159> much

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
time in a scene can help create much

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.369 
time in a scene can help create much
more<00:04:39.849> realistic<00:04:40.240> lighting<00:04:40.690> than<00:04:41.020> using<00:04:41.349> just

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
more realistic lighting than using just

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.469 
more realistic lighting than using just
one<00:04:41.860> or<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.220> other<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:42.639> they<00:04:43.030> really<00:04:43.300> work

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
one or the other and they really work

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.089 
one or the other and they really work
well<00:04:43.690> together<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.409> you<00:04:44.560> start<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.919> combine

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
well together if you start to combine

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.950 
well together if you start to combine
the<00:04:45.580> strengths<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.090> both<00:04:46.300> so<00:04:46.629> there's<00:04:46.900> just

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the strengths of both so there's just

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.490 
the strengths of both so there's just
global<00:04:47.500> illumination<00:04:48.720> here's<00:04:49.720> just<00:04:50.139> final

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
global illumination here's just final

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.350 
global illumination here's just final
gathering<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.099> here<00:04:51.789> is<00:04:51.879> global

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
gathering and here is global

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.670 
gathering and here is global
illumination<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:53.050> final<00:04:53.409> gathering

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
illumination and final gathering

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.099 
illumination and final gathering
together
