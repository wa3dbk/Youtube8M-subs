00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.000
 Certainly provided because it is in the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.170

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.120
 no idea anywhere I have the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.530
 meanwhile get on the nose 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.849

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.320
 second time instead of the last time has 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.029
