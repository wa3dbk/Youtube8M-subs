00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
have many goals but I think it'll spread

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.729 
have many goals but I think it'll spread
it<00:02:36.310> with<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.549> this<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.290> right<00:02:38.530> there

you need to drill hose down there and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.580 
you need to drill hose down there and
then<00:02:45.909> you<00:02:46.030> got<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.269> put<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.540> visor<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.379> it

then you got to put the visor on so it
will<00:02:47.889> look<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.189> this<00:02:50.639> sorry<00:02:51.639> when<00:02:51.909> Paul<00:02:52.180> said

need<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.579> folder<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.280> see<00:03:06.519> on<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
need a folder and then you see on the

poacher you need to do the red triangle

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.440 
poacher you need to do the red triangle
there<00:03:10.439> so<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:12.579> need<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> poacher<00:03:13.120> like<00:03:13.299> that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
there so you need a poacher like that

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.699 
there so you need a poacher like that
you<00:03:13.629> don't<00:03:13.659> need<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.989> do<00:03:14.079> anything<00:03:14.260> else<00:03:14.470> to

adjuster that red triangle pop that on

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.460 
adjuster that red triangle pop that on
so<00:03:19.479> it<00:03:19.629> looks<00:03:19.659> like<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:21.220> might<00:03:21.519> need<00:03:22.000> to

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
so it looks like that you might need to

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.199 
so it looks like that you might need to
shave<00:03:23.470> down<00:03:23.859> on<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:25.090> helmet<00:03:26.760> let<00:03:27.760> bit<00:03:27.970> there
