00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.860
 look 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:28.950
 the two teams 4 and 4 6 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.500
 I know that the other orange runs more but 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 fact twists better son of a bitch 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 and very happy 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.649
 to the above 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 the explosion for gamers and mushrooms 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.770
 or 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.630
 once he is by my side and I have not 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.630
 done the still 4 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.150
 the missiles were already saying 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.690
 by the way 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.619
 as a bastard 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.569
 Anyway as more advanced 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.010
 was super first that has not been 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.010
 early that we came from the other side 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.770
 but as now 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.120
 has points 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.340
 what a strange thing 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.650
 you have to go you have to call a 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.050
 editor stuck in the ass to fuck 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.040
 that point 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.019
 I think I know how to take it 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.310
 I think we all also all believe 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.270
 that also went before his life 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.270
 partner 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:40.989
 is the joy you are a sigh lizard 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:44.609
 and do not pass over you can not be uncle 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.609
 in shit I was 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.730
 this race of tomatoes in erasures 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.700
 because he has put the VAT on me 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.120
 last and it was assumed that the third was already 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.480
 I do not understand very well you know come come 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.480
 rare 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.530
 apart from what happens that gives me the 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.230
 feeling that he does not walk but this 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.230
 lad 14 hours ago 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.930
 I go second first because I do not 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.550
 I understand someone took out that the point of 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.350
 above 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:23.860
 the first one above 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:31.550
 as I am a killer or machine 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:34.610
 there is a 16 va are many but tiki taka 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.740
 how joan picked her in the lane 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.400
 otherwise it has turbo just to the side 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.400
 of this one 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.580
 I am the worst thing that I would love father 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.960
 today among his bad bad really 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.850
 has seen very bad people using 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.010
 bad but bad bad I will pass the 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.010
 goal because they can not be capped 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:09.200
 then the suitcase why 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:14.710
 I'm going to see how my eyes 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.710

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.750
 no turbo to impossible to get now let's go 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.130
 to see, I do not arrive, so did my rival 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.130
 it's like this 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:43.610
 and I do not know what it looks like without 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:43.610
 turbo does not rise or of coÃ±a 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:52.910
 you have not seen we are going 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.910
 And now that the end came 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.320

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.230
 efe 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:24.920
 enough so that it does not reach the 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.350
 things of those rare 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.220

 my mother that go point shit a 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.830
 hour an hour but I understand I have 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.830
 seen from simple 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.170
