00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.260
 integrated into the front coupé look 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.260

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.580
 the cockpit is clear that 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.560
 Display retractable and the ideal sound 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.920

 fittings are clearly arranged and 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.020
 are dominated by the courageous tacho the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.220
 Seats are with air conditioning and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.850
 the big display is homogeneous in the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.850
 Integrated dashboard 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.480
 The weapons in this duel are 23 liters 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.870
 diesel engines of the a7 draws from it 245 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.000
 ps 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.190
 the sprint to 100 completes the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.250
 ingolstädter in 6 3 seconds and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.519
 reaches a topspeed of 250 km h 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.120
 is switched with a seven-speed 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.700
 Double clutch 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.780
 Consumption is 5.9 liters per 100 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.269
 kilometer 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.840
 the audi slides comfortably over the 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.700
 roads 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.230
 the gears are switched quickly and 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 the efficiency planner ensures that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 moderate consumption almost the same 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.060
 performance data sets the mercedes cls 350 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.959
 from 0 to 100 in 6 4 seconds and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.069
 also a top speed of 250 km h 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.319
 however, the six cylinder delivers 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.750
 mercedes 265 hp 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.769
 Here, too, comes a seven-speed automatic 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.230
 gear for use 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.910
 6 liters should the cls thanks blue 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.400
 Consuming efficiency engineering 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.410
 the mercedes takes the curves sparkling 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.910
 and is well on the road without that 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.810
 one on the desired driving comfort 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.810
 must give up 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.310
 the first secondary duel is this 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.790
 space offers the audi offers 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.459
 trunk volume of 535 liters yet 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.410
 two suitcases in size 59 on 81 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.410
 centimeters are just barely enough space 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.989
 the automatic closing mechanism 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.989
 must be helped easily 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.990
 the passenger compartment is for small 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.810
 built inmates 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.790
 our test editor measures 1 meter 88 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.460
 and has both in the driver's seat as 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.200
 also in the fund space problems head and knee 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:00.770
 bump hard just behind the cls 350 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.660
 has only 520 liters of luggage space and volume 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.610
 a smaller loading opening than the audi 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.440
 but our two suitcases can be 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.240
 easier to stow away and find 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.430
 significantly more air in the place 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.440
 trunk also in mercedes sits 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.390
 editor ralf very close but after 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.959
 own statements are not as close as in the 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.870
 audi 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.760
 they have a little more freedom in the back 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.700
 Secondary number two is the 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.660
 driving assistance of the mercedes is waiting 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.510
 speed limits distance warning 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.620
 active parking assistant and rollover 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.210
 Sensor is standard on this class 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.420
 the automatic traffic sign 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.630
 recognition and the track keeping assistant 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.320
 the assistant paketplus costs 2600 euros 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.320
 additional charge 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.900
 the a7 sportback is content with 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.540
 lanekeeper tempolimit indicator 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.540
 and distance control as well as head up display 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.510
 the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.540
 new is the night vision assistant 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.280
 with automatic pedestrian detection 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.280
 however for 1600 euros surcharge 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.680
 both upper class cars boast higher 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.510
 smooth running and low noise 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.750
 the driver must be in the a7 at 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.250
 Motorway rides with 180 km / h up to 70 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.250
 decibel loud volume 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.570
 mercedes in the decibel knife shows at 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:54.120
 same speed one 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:56.970
 highest value of 76 to the duel loses 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.950
 the a7 has just less space comfort 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.400
 and a smaller one 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.920
 Safety features make that 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 small difference, moreover, is the 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.560
 audi with 92 1700 euro almost 10,000 euro 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.960
 more expensive than the mercedes alone 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.770
 soundsystem already beats with over 5,000 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.770
 euro to book 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.520
 the cls 350 scores with the same engine 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:22.469
 with 20 ps more and unfolds its true 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.479
 Size only at second glance like 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:28.169
 seat and suitcase have shown test 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.449
 the price of 83,000 350 euro speaks 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.219
 for the stuttgart most expensive part of the 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.810
 special equipment is the amg sport package 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.810
 with three and a half thousand euros
