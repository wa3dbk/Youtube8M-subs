betrayal I think that I want to make a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.250 
betrayal I think that I want to make a
personal<00:00:45.059> choice<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.110> been<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
personal choice and there have been a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
personal choice and there have been a
few<00:00:46.320> times<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.770> life<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.070> thought<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.850> could<00:00:48.180> just

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
few times my life I thought I could just

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.139 
few times my life I thought I could just
get<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> surgery<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.640> whole

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
get a surgery and you know this whole

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.580 
get a surgery and you know this whole
part<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:51.539> life<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> deal<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.170> that's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
part of my life that I deal with that's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350 
part of my life that I deal with that's
causing<00:00:53.070> conflict<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.850> over<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
causing conflict would just be over and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
causing conflict would just be over and
things<00:00:54.510> it'd<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.780> easier<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> think

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
things it'd be much easier but I think

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
things it'd be much easier but I think
that's<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> wrong<00:00:56.460> mindset<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.180> into<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
that's the wrong mindset to go into it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
that's the wrong mindset to go into it
you<00:00:57.690> can't<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.109> into<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> surgery<00:00:58.920> thinking

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you can't go into the surgery thinking

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.950 
you can't go into the surgery thinking
that<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> will<00:00:59.730> solve<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.180> problems<00:01:00.510> a

that it will solve all your problems a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.630 
that it will solve all your problems a
lot<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> people<00:01:01.559> go<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.100> because<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
lot of people go into this because it is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.100 
lot of people go into this because it is
a<00:01:02.670> life-saving<00:01:03.270> thing<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.809> something<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a life-saving thing it is something that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.479 
a life-saving thing it is something that
they<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> wait<00:01:05.309> where

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
they have to do they get to wait where

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.300 
they have to do they get to wait where
health<00:01:06.330> concerns<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:07.080> over<00:01:07.380> its<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.950> too

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
health concerns take over its it's too

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039

hard to function and get through your
daily<00:01:10.320> life<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.850> are

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
daily life I think that there are

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.460 
daily life I think that there are
definitely<00:01:12.240> people<00:01:12.330> who<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:12.990> into<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> very

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
definitely people who go into it very

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.859 
definitely people who go into it very
lightly<00:01:13.799> thinking<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> answer

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
lightly thinking this will be the answer

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
lightly thinking this will be the answer
this<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.560> solve<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.770> problems<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:18.210> will

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this will solve my problems this will

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.140 
this will solve my problems this will

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.380 
that job this will make me beautiful and
the<00:01:23.250> problem<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.119> start

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
from the inside and work out it's never

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
from the inside and work out it's never
going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.729> anything<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.869> truth

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
going to do anything because the truth

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.240 
going to do anything because the truth
is<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.680> people<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.130> the
