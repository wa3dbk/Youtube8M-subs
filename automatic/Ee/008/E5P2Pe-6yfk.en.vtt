smokey<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.729> almost<00:01:33.360> sheer<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.369> glittery

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
smokey I was almost sheer and glittery

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.749 
smokey I was almost sheer and glittery
more<00:01:35.970> than<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.930> dark<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> smoky

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
more than very dark and smoky

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.760 
more than very dark and smoky
I<00:01:38.790> guess<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.509> makes<00:01:39.780> sense<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.259> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I guess if that makes sense it's just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.270 
I guess if that makes sense it's just
not<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.159> jet-black<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.770> sheer

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
not as jet-black as it was just a sheer

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
not as jet-black as it was just a sheer
nice<00:01:44.790> smoky<00:01:45.450> eye<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.380> are<00:01:46.560> kind<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
nice smoky eye so we are kind of just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
nice smoky eye so we are kind of just
blending<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.149> pulling<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> out<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
blending this out and pulling it out a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.010 
blending this out and pulling it out a
