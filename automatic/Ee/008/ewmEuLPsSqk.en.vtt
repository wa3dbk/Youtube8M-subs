00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
him first thing you see is that his legs

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.580 
him first thing you see is that his legs

that<00:04:46.160> was<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.520> give<00:04:46.640> it<00:04:46.730> more<00:04:46.880> stability

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
that was to give it more stability

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.270 
that was to give it more stability
