how<00:00:28.730> we<00:00:28.789> kind<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.240> gone<00:00:29.390> from<00:00:29.509> 2d<00:00:29.810> to<00:00:29.840> 3d<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.349> a

how we kind of gone from 2d to 3d is a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:41.220 
how we kind of gone from 2d to 3d is a
very<00:00:30.619> dramatic<00:00:30.770> moment

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230

he's really excited about this movie
this<00:00:43.640> ability<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.269> create<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.719> world<00:00:45.109> from

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
this ability to create a world from

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.649 
this ability to create a world from
scratch<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.070> because<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.699> grid<00:00:46.940> was<00:00:47.300> created

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
scratch and because the grid was created

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.869 
scratch and because the grid was created
by<00:00:47.780> Kevin<00:00:48.260> Flynn<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.890> world<00:00:49.100> had<00:00:49.339> to<00:00:49.430> feel<00:00:49.640> as

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
by Kevin Flynn the world had to feel as

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.549 
by Kevin Flynn the world had to feel as
if<00:00:49.909> every<00:00:50.390> detail<00:00:50.780> was<00:00:50.809> done<00:00:51.199> by<00:00:51.379> one<00:00:51.530> person

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
if every detail was done by one person

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.579 
if every detail was done by one person
we<00:00:52.159> wanted<00:00:52.430> a<00:00:52.670> very<00:00:52.940> real<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.570> tactile<00:00:54.289> world

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
we wanted a very real and tactile world

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.469 
we wanted a very real and tactile world
but<00:00:54.860> one<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:55.280> wasn't<00:00:55.640> constrained<00:00:56.239> by

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
but one that wasn't constrained by

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:03.910 
but one that wasn't constrained by
anything<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:02.510> tron<00:01:02.809> world<00:01:03.079> is<00:01:03.289> you<00:01:03.799> know

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
anything the tron world is you know

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.980 
anything the tron world is you know
incredibly<00:01:04.460> dark<00:01:04.699> there's<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.479> grander

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
incredibly dark there's the grander

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.100 
incredibly dark there's the grander
sense<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.500> geography<00:01:07.539> there's<00:01:08.539> the<00:01:08.720> lightning

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
sense of geography there's the lightning

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.969 
sense of geography there's the lightning
storms<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.830> weather<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:12.289> blight<00:01:12.590> cycles

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
storms in the weather the blight cycles

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.710 
storms in the weather the blight cycles
operate<00:01:13.460> under<00:01:13.819> the<00:01:13.850> principles<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.509> physics

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
operate under the principles of physics

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.389 
operate under the principles of physics
of<00:01:14.960> our<00:01:15.080> world<00:01:15.319> so<00:01:15.619> they<00:01:15.740> can<00:01:15.890> behave<00:01:16.130> like

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
of our world so they can behave like

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.410 
of our world so they can behave like
actual<00:01:16.819> motorcycles<00:01:18.280> it's<00:01:19.280> perfect<00:01:19.580> no<00:01:20.149> this

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
actual motorcycles it's perfect no this

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.149 
actual motorcycles it's perfect no this
like<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.869> incredibly<00:01:21.409> in<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.649> class<00:01:21.860> yeah

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
like is incredibly in the class yeah

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.540 
like is incredibly in the class yeah
cool<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.789> it's<00:01:22.880> dangerous

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.580 

we<00:01:26.550> made<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> disc<00:01:27.270> game<00:01:27.590> multi-dimensional

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
we made the disc game multi-dimensional

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.810 
we made the disc game multi-dimensional
and<00:01:29.340> gave<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> much<00:01:30.330> more<00:01:30.570> velocity<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
and gave it much more velocity and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
and gave it much more velocity and
created<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.120> more<00:01:33.480> complex<00:01:33.930> gaming

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
created just a more complex gaming

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:47.660 
created just a more complex gaming
experience

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.160 

I<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:48.330> you're<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.689> feel<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.900> you're

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
I think you're going to feel like you're

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.870 
I think you're going to feel like you're
in<00:01:49.259> another<00:01:49.320> universe<00:01:50.009> where<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.400> stakes<00:01:50.670> are

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
in another universe where the stakes are

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:14.950 
in another universe where the stakes are
real<00:01:51.119> where<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> danger<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.170> real

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.020 

you
