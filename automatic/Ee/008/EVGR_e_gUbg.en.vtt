00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.520
 hello unpacks friends hello youtube 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 my name is don thompson and today is 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.610
 the big day came 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 some of you already had 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.900
 much earlier post I believe some 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.030
 even on saturday it is with me 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 all appeared punctually on Monday 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.710
 there we have it already a funny 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.970
 Amazon paypal and all or want 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.220
 first on travel 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.930
 he can be seen already i have my effort 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.660
 and not even the packaging on 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.519
 get back a piece and again 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.070
 A piece of away you get this snippet he 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.019
 Away away sometimes 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.190
 It helps a bit, too 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.600
 Let's have a look at what now 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 everything is so in here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.690
 Of course it already hints what 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.370
 we're unpacking today 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 drum roll what do we have that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.940
 nice that the packaging to the side 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.690
 well we already please see anything grand 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.340
 theft auto 5 gta 5 has come here 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.350
 still original welded and indeed 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.790
 this is the special 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.180
 We'll have a look at edition under 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.229
 exactly what's in it all so long 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.060
 We must first have a look 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.610
 so the foil removes if you completely 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 short times nothing in the picture then see lies 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.210
 it simply that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.649
 I'm wild in the background with the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.600
 foil fights that was not 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.060
 so easy because I had no 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.619
 bush knife and nothing and pupsi 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.360
 my cameraman does not have me either 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.040
 As a result, the bush knife had to be served 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.469
 I hereby strive my fingernails and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.619
 Do not fold here to prove the 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.729
 foil the packaging has lost and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.219
 then we look again again 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 the one against the soft packaging 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.360
 normal cardboard is the whole thing 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.799
 so nothing great is of quality 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.180
 By the way, the usk logo is on it 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.340
 I believe not printed is printed 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.810
 or so that is to pull from the pub 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 anyway very bad for me what you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.390
 take a look at the blueprint plan of los santos 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.039
 we'll go back later 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.539
 then on the whole thing we have one 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.250
 Here is a code for the special edition 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.050
 Of course, I will not tell you the number 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.460
 i can show you is as well as such 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.359
 redeemed each carton is empty 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.590
 more is not possible 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.420
 the thing is really empty he is not 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.340
 bonbon anymore nothing in it anymore 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.749
 and here I would say 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.790
 put the height up a bit so 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:26.499
 Here's a look at that 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.430
 beautiful steelbook is still original 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.769
 welds the tear one also immediately 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.379
 out back do not be surprised also 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.719
 always here from the side relative 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.719
 simply kept matt black the whole 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.180
 not shiny the dealbook view is 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.489
 also not marked there is god thank you 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.400
 a usk logo or something else on it 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.689
 just a beautiful beautiful 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.359
 beautiful printed steelbook as I said 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.879
 not embossed or similar things so 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.469
 thank god there is no scratch in 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.419
 the matt black paint was nothing 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.250
 worse than if you or as if 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.079
 you have in black steelbook then have 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.540
 du bottom left a small silver 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.459
 something like that just falls on at least 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.169
 you know where to look so i 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.159
 fight men back like wild with 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.599
 the film 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.919
 I do not know if you wanted that 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.209
 anyway I do not see it here now 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.159
 can do a bit in cut though 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.480
 I thought human you, I believe 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.799
 now even a bit further, we 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.290
 will also have a look later 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.239
 to throw on the blueprint with it 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.340
 yes, let's see how big the whole thing is 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.259
 because the plans bring it to the daylight 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.150
 they are not that small 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.669
 So for the complete table so out 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.949
 We finally managed to see that here 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.720
 now the three main characters and that 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.310
 whole again from the back straight up 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.569
 foretaste beautiful matte black the whole 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.030
 there we see two for one 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.590
 dvds the one with the bunny on it 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.259
 this is the installation disc the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.389
 do you need for the game installed 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:49.040
 and then you need the games to the 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.159
 that's it with the two girls 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.409
 on it took a girl cd 12 girls cd2 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.359
 rest is relatively easy to remember 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.979
 So we have a small 15 only 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.870
 instructions if i will last again 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.009
 unboxing thinks the thing is relative for 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.419
 kept rudimentary 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.009
 we need a guide here 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.419
 because I almost do not think so or 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.159
 we have the big one again 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.569
 map applicants later again 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.669
 look closely 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.860
 here again a look at the inlay 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:18.130
 pressure federal reserve system 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.959
 by liberty city dos santos liberty city 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.940
 was there much later so i believe 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.080
 Although here the plan times very briefly 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.300
 but then I put it up very fast 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.280
 that does not fit everything 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.550
 my table is the sum of medium too 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.620
 big but he either zoom away or 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.540
 looking up close as you recognize that 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.490
 one or the other does not stop like that 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.480
 I said I would have all still the same 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.790
 a little bit together around here 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.950
 you ever see how big the map 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.990
 in itself, here we are also so im 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.970
 look at the activities we have here 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.010
 For example, we have that 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.840
 can play or at a flight school 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.280
 We can, however, take hours 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.860
 even if you are funny mean golf 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.740
 play or on the shooting range ours 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.390
 shoots a bit so expand now 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.190
 I noticed the cards make 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.120
 we again extra I put it all 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.220
 together again, we have the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.410
 Packaging the minimalist instruction 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.840
 the colleagues up there then this one 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.820
 two dvd is yes at the playstation is 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.440
 it's just a blu-ray and then here's that 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.970
 difference is, however, then we scroll 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.770
 a little bit had moved away 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.210
 here we see the whole map 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.600
 from los santos 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.270
 that's me but call it the city 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.040
 the bronx of the capital part 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.450
 So there you have the top right away 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.460
 I had a legend a few things 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.979
 already said there are a few 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.650
 shops and not even you here so 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.070
 Big was around then gta san andreas 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.600
 notter know approximately how big going on 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.790
 santos has become meanwhile here 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.370
 we see here so the outback namely 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.810
 Below we have the capital here 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.460
 I have just now been shown you 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.410
 and above all the green 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.080
 that's the outback that's all 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.340
 So it is not without synonymous 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.020
 we see here is a small airline 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.610
 is located that is also on airplanes 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.350
 the island and that you have left below 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.740
 drawn so that knows where the 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.370
 Aviator at the end of his stop makes 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.419
 not so small, there are even 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.340
 Auto repair shops and stuff is everything 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.440
 plotted so you're in here too 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.600
 I'm packing the city now 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.430
 In the end, the blueprint comes out again 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.590
 The blueprint is actually what it is 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.750
 building plan of los santos 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.070
 is relatively thick paper so also the 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.900
 plan is not so thin 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.790
 sandwich paper but relatively good 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.650
 Haptic sniffs a bit 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.450
 paint makes something in any case 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.190
 and here is again really happy so 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.990
 I mean I do not have it the shortest 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.240
 name the thing that fits really like 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.380
 Just said that on my table 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.940
 you see everything has to go too 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.010
 example tuning workshops are or where 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.110
 hidden faster cars hidden 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.520
 So there you can still rest 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.500
 take a look at the map 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.510
 and I do not think so 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.820
 take a look at the map once 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.590
 because the city is really huge 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.840
 I have currently played big 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.730
 that does not happen until Wednesday 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.800
 punctually the whole thing comes 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.570
 but I thought today to pre-glow 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.620
 Let's do an unboxing first and here 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.570
 I'll put it all in peace again 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.310
 is the beautiful steelbook without 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.080
 All that is printed is God 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.970
 Thanks without brand then the games 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.910
 Packaging a simple cardboard box with 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.980
 fsk 18 logo the game is from 18 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.950
 then I put now on top of it yet 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.330
 the main card the cds I leave it 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.180
 just because the hamburger 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.890
 Everything already looked good when this 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.540
 unboxing has entertained a bit 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.040
 then please go to my thumb 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.930
 Upstairs is not all that easy
