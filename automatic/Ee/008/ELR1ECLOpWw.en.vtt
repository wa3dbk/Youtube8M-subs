00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
Glenn and you could do that for did you

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.150 
Glenn and you could do that for did you
live<00:03:04.110> running<00:03:04.320> light<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.560> strong<00:03:04.740> safety

since<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.820> already<00:03:06.120> got<00:03:06.210> him<00:03:06.390> since<00:03:06.630> they're

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
since we already got him since they're

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.450 
since we already got him since they're
both<00:03:06.960> pretty<00:03:07.230> much<00:03:07.350> max<00:03:07.710> be<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> feel<00:03:08.220> like

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
both pretty much max be I feel like

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.460 
both pretty much max be I feel like
maybe<00:03:08.760> 98<00:03:09.300> speed<00:03:09.570> but<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> got<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.960> speed<00:03:10.230> boost

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
maybe 98 speed but I got a speed boost

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.740 
maybe 98 speed but I got a speed boost
so<00:03:10.680> he's<00:03:11.040> pretty<00:03:11.190> much<00:03:11.370> match<00:03:11.670> speed<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.300> at

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
so he's pretty much match speed and at

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.230 
so he's pretty much match speed and at

I'm I just double take this line of
humor<00:05:01.660> in<00:05:01.780> both<00:05:01.990> tick<00:05:02.230> lanes<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.800> don't<00:05:02.980> know<00:05:03.040> I

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
humor in both tick lanes I don't know I

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.980 
humor in both tick lanes I don't know I
mean<00:05:03.310> this<00:05:03.430> one<00:05:03.670> doesn't<00:05:04.540> really<00:05:04.570> fall<00:05:04.840> into

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
mean this one doesn't really fall into

mean this one doesn't really fall into
the<00:05:05.170> speak<00:05:05.440> category<00:05:06.010> cuz<00:05:06.250> it's<00:05:06.370> not<00:05:06.490> that

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
the speak category cuz it's not that

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.400 
the speak category cuz it's not that
fast<00:05:06.970> but<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.360> think<00:05:07.420> tonight<00:05:07.750> -<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.170> dreamy

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410

leaves<00:05:08.620> now<00:05:09.040> probably<00:05:09.490> run<00:05:09.640> this<00:05:09.730> line<00:05:09.910> up<00:05:10.000> to

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
leaves now probably run this line up to

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.850 
leaves now probably run this line up to
two<00:05:10.360> claims<00:05:10.630> then<00:05:10.900> maybe<00:05:11.080> when<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.560> push<00:05:11.740> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
two claims then maybe when I push the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.530 
two claims then maybe when I push the
gameplay<00:05:12.280> running<00:05:12.580> with<00:05:12.670> money<00:05:12.850> lot<00:05:13.090> he's<00:05:13.510> a

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
gameplay running with money lot he's a

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.420 
gameplay running with money lot he's a
little<00:05:13.810> bit<00:05:13.900> faster<00:05:14.320> on<00:05:14.530> offense<00:05:15.130> for<00:05:15.190> now<00:05:15.400> I

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
little bit faster on offense for now I

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.760 
little bit faster on offense for now I
guess<00:05:15.760> rg3<00:05:16.060> at<00:05:16.570> quarterback<00:05:16.900> until<00:05:17.410> I<00:05:17.440> get

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
guess rg3 at quarterback until I get

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.590 
guess rg3 at quarterback until I get
that<00:05:17.920> ultimate<00:05:18.130> legend<00:05:18.640> Michael<00:05:18.790> Vick<00:05:19.180> berry

at<00:05:19.780> halfback<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.890> guess<00:05:21.070> maybe<00:05:21.280> speed

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
at halfback and I guess maybe speed

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.580 
at halfback and I guess maybe speed
