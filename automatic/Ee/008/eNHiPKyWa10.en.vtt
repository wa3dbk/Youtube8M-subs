00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello so we come with embassy me 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.619
 am yours again today with the question 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.830
 by mister at jako-o akoya 94 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.609
 he does the week twice a week 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.430
 judgment 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.910
 twice a week mcfit couple jogging times 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.220
 sober in the morning and school sports ob 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.980
 I think the game too much sport no 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.309
 too much sport does not exist naturally 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.120
 Sports are very very articulated 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.579
 you have to strain yourself 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.100
 think carefully how much you make of it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 but basically said so much sport 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 There are, on the whole, actually 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.680
 not if you want to do sports 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.149
 do more sports 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 I'm going for a while and see 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.920
 not so big after losing weight 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.680
 underneath is still novak we had 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 Last time with a comment 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.949
 take or not is primarily because of how 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.289
 a lot of you i am informed about 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.180
 Themes nutrition for a constant 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.250
 calorie deficits you take from whole 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 but that alone he has 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 Of course you are quite right 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710
 You should watch how much you use 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.810
 how much you are that is actually 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.000
 more important is how much 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 calories do you ever take to you pro 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.220
 day that's the big question 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.460
 you should track that over 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.890
 calorie counter app or fdp point info 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 so online or on the smartphone or 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.259
 on the pc there is the software can 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.770
 Oman 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.329
 i believe in the apple operating system 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.670
 There are on the apple operating system 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.079
 certainly synonymous a few apps for it 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.119
 if you like it just for ipad 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.090
 and for the iphone also already gives 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.310
 I think of that is synonymous for the normal 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 So apple system gives something that is 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.820
 very important that you first 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.119
 look what I actually whether you the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.530
 now also write and very old-fashioned 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.780
 with a table do something natural 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.969
 is super annoying or if that over the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 modern aids help you do that 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.799
 Of course, that's the most important thing 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.270
 where is where is your condition? 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.340
 in the truest sense of the word is one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.960
 is-state and then you can 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 deduct calorie consumption 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.160
 and if you do not succeed, then 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.810
 do you seem to overeat yet? 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.580
 without your even too little 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.350
 simply drove down the metabolism 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.300
 that comes to your his 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.030
 Body size on your metabolism 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.350
 Type on your body fat content it 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.750
 also comes very, very many things 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.750
 just so it is too much sport or 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.430
 not enough something is not right either 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.110
 it is eaten too much or something 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.620
 It can not really be too little sport 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.420
 his 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.980
 so you have to eat too much or 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.720
 to be eaten too little you have to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.360
 every case calorie consumption and 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.580
 calorie intake in any case compared 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.590
 make the calorie consumption you can 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.560
 I figure out the formulas I'm working on 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.940
 the videos always give it to there 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.590
 various calculations that is 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.610
 of course a trial &amp; error story 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.380
 you have to try it 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.220
 not the same formula applies to everyone 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.930
 quite logically or there are 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.430
 service providers just like that for example 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.900
 offer bracelets like me now 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.120
 to wear one example is sense or 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.520
 bracelet i blind it down here 11 o'clock 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.400
 means that the costs themselves, I believe 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.000
 somehow around the 1500 euro included 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.230
 software 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.400
 that means one should one should 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.350
 do not do it yourself but you should 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.120
 actually for five to seven 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.800
 rent days or three to four days 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.959
 one training day one 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.520
 measure training-free day and 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.650
 Let's see how it looks 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.390
 calorie consumption that you do the thing 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.790
 is pretty much everything but the pulse 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.230
 I have the feeling and there I am already 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.350
 for example, something exciting for me 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.780
 out comes because of the formulas 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.130
 Of course not from these individual ones 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.140
 things or you can do the individual 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.850
 thing not include so with what if 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.760
 Now here's such a thing 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.680
 poor sweat blah blah blah it is 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.480
 some data endangers itself if he 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.370
 At night you will try it yourself 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.630
 Find out the thing you saw so many 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.190
 things crap that's one too 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.860
 possibility the cheapest possibility 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.209
 as I said, even with the formulas 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.459
 try the whole thing 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.800
 try to figure it out with it 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.000
 works your is-state 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.550
 of course, put the 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.130
 Shut down in a calorie deficit 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.560
 vinovo karin already said so nicely 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.810
 and with a calorie deficit then goes 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.480
 It then slowly downhill and slowly 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.520
 is always good fast what you lose 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.950
 is mostly water otherwise at all 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.510
 nothing fat and muscular what you are 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.799
 Of course, want to keep high protein 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.850
 Consumption 2 grams per kilogram 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.670
 body weight is the condition 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.620
 I have the two grams of heroin consumption 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.660
 thread lost 2 12 grams of protein per 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.910
 kilogram of body weight muscle 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.740
 Slowly lose fat one has become 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.400
 usually not in a year on it 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.890
 eaten 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.200
 So you have to spend several years 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.200
 or a year or more, including time 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.060
 give the whole thing to lose because 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.640
 positive happens just as slowly 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.650
 unfortunately god like negative the negative 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.120
 But most of the time you have that totally 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.280
 gone fast no it is not 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.780
 and the positive is unfortunately also very 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.370
 very slow so a bit more accurate 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.080
 do not just say where I do it 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.390
 sport here i do sport there but 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.010
 that is what I am actually eating 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:07.100
 that find out calorie balance 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.320
 adjust depending on the goal and that's it 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:16.630
 for today see you tomorrow with me 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:18.980
 just look creative 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.050
 as long as we have a page again 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.090
 that is on the next page 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.340
 we'll see you again tomorrow 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.340
 Wednesday makes it so good to soft 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.830
 schnitzel 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.830
