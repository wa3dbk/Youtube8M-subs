a watermark here that I want to remove
this<00:02:18.180> might<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.599> little<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:19.370> better<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.640> an

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
this might be a little bit better of an

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.210 
this might be a little bit better of an
example<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.840> hit<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> play<00:02:25.170> button

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
example just do that hit the play button

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.080 
example just do that hit the play button
and<00:02:26.599> that's<00:02:27.599> easily<00:02:27.810> removed<00:02:28.880> same<00:02:29.880> thing

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and that's easily removed same thing

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.059 
and that's easily removed same thing

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
I mean that the example and I couldn't

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.370 
I mean that the example and I couldn't
find<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.639> picture<00:03:26.819> like<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.900> sales<00:03:28.170> on

of<00:03:29.730> people<00:03:30.090> behind<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.799> beach<00:03:32.010> you

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
of people behind you on the beach you

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.069 
of people behind you on the beach you

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
know it's always kind of annoying and

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.870 
know it's always kind of annoying and
you<00:03:34.170> want<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.410> isolate<00:03:34.590> all<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.700> could

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
you want to isolate all that you could

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.509 
you want to isolate all that you could
really<00:03:36.269> use<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.959> tool<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:38.040> eliminate

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
really use this tool to eliminate

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.460 
really use this tool to eliminate
anything<00:03:39.120> behind<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.049> look<00:03:40.319> like

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
anything behind you so you look like

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.020 
anything behind you so you look like
you're<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.829> only<00:03:40.859> ones<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.609> beach<00:03:41.760> or<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
you're the only ones on the beach or the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.180 
you're the only ones on the beach or the
only<00:03:42.329> one<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:43.440> think<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:43.950> go<00:03:44.130> to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
only one and I think that if you go to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.050 
only one and I think that if you go to
example<00:03:44.639> 2<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.660> using<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.290> tool<00:03:47.250> here<00:03:50.060> I'm

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
example 2 of using this tool here I'm

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.970 
example 2 of using this tool here I'm
not<00:03:51.299> very<00:03:51.420> quick<00:03:51.900> at<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.200> stuff<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.769> let's

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
not very quick at this stuff so let's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.339 
not very quick at this stuff so let's
see<00:03:53.780> or<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.930> looks<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.970> hope<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.420> want<00:03:58.319> a

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
see or it looks I hope that I want a

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.559 
see or it looks I hope that I want a
little<00:03:58.500> bit<00:03:58.680> over<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.950> mark<00:03:59.190> there<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.030> let's

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
little bit over to mark there so let's

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.930 
little bit over to mark there so let's
try<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.230> see<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.190> raised<00:04:02.519> part<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.880> my

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
try it and see if I raised part of my

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.349 
try it and see if I raised part of my
arm<00:04:04.280> alright<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.639> big<00:04:05.849> area<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.299> you

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
arm alright this is a big area so you

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.610 
arm alright this is a big area so you
can<00:04:06.450> see<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:06.840> taken<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.200> little<00:04:07.290> bit<00:04:07.500> longer

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
can see it's taken a little bit longer

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.550 
can see it's taken a little bit longer
but<00:04:07.919> it's<00:04:08.069> still<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.549> pretty<00:04:09.150> fast<00:04:09.560> rendering

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
but it's still a pretty fast rendering

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.170 
but it's still a pretty fast rendering
process<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:12.060> do<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.079> this<00:04:14.180> application

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
process to do this so this application

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.640 
process to do this so this application
like<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.450> said<00:04:15.689> it's<00:04:15.870> seventy-five<00:04:16.409> percent

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
like I said it's seventy-five percent

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.750 
like I said it's seventy-five percent
off<00:04:16.950> in

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
off in

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.760 
off in
