00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.250
 the biggest football temple in the republic gets sold out 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.790
 Over 80 000 spectators in the Dortmund Signal Iduna Park won the game of 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.150
 Borussia against Hoffenheim look at the previous clashes here in the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.349
 Football Upper House ended in a draw 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.029
 the guests in blue with the first big chance ninth minute 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.800
 Gustavo &amp; 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.089
 they mate 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.849
 and it's already 0 to 1 let's start for the Hoffenheim 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.439
 The Barbarian celebrates his goal of the season 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.460
 For three games, the league leaders from Dortmund has not scored a goal 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 now the Borussia is already back after nine minutes 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.270
 just under a quarter of an hour past the answer of BVB 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.080
 Providence clarified the ball was from Kaka 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 clear penalty with hand 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 Shahin against goalkeeper strong is the duel 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.880
 Nushi Charlene shoots 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 12 thought all the work the helper needs to be repeated 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.360
 Barrios had run into the penalty area too early 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.740
 second try 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.189
 this time parried eighteen99 goalkeeper strong Dortmund further 0 1 behind 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.850
 The team of coach Klopp last won seven games in series 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.650
 the next possibility in the 36 minute let them short the 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.450
 Accordingly, after a free kick the ball 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.740
 over the gate missed this opportunity 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 pensive faces for a break 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.890
 injured at the last very spoiled Borussia 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.030
 49 minutes the BVB Express rolls on 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.220
 Barrios 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.510
 Were day of the year 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.230
 Bauhof largely loyal 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 but also so far without constraints water 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.740
 well over an hour past Dortmund pushes on 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.359
 Barrios 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.969
 and strong but get his knee in between Hoffenheim but it baffles 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.969
 is still 0 to 1 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.019
 direct return of the guests 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.609
 Gutsche becomes 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:27.949
 and that would have 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.359
 a nail fits Weidenfeller and the crossbar are for the BVB 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.060
 after the 99 Coach Rangnick knows 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.060
 that would have been practically the decision 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.040
 stoppage time the very last chance for Borussia 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.699
 92 the minute 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.139
 da Silva is placed just before the penalty area kick 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 da Silva occurs himself 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.129
 1 practically with the final whistle, the Borussia is still eating 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:04.069
 same with his first goal of the season and just as important and pro one 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.069
 beautiful 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.419
 because of complaining Salihovics subsequently still yellow-red 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.229
 at 1 2 1 it stays 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:26.700
 also the third meeting of the two teams in Dortmund ends Remy 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.739
 The shooter of the late equalizer is modest after the game 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.729
 with 2 0 in the lead 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.699
 Of course pleasing Michelle that is nice could play 20 minutes Euro 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.509
 she ceases to be ready 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:45.669
 but again and again would have to wait for my chance and see something there 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:46.499
 use 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.670
 which then when you were drawn back to the great luckless 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.630
 What was this one point should you disclose 19 you should not 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.480
 Overlook Think about the draw that he millions the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.999
 faster felt us 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:59.479
 yes summer 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.219
 you have to see that we pass a bit of revue that's it 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.339
 more than earned and 4 then tried
