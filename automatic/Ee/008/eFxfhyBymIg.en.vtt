00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
really big card company overseas and so

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.179 
really big card company overseas and so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and more the backhoes line is a mirrored

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.399 
and more the backhoes line is a mirrored
image<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> biplane<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> top<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
image of the biplane on the top and the
bottom<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> circle<00:01:38.790> graphic

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
bottom then you have a circle graphic

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.060 
bottom then you have a circle graphic
and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.509> some<00:01:40.110> spades<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> corner<00:01:40.890> and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
nice I like the fact that as gaming

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.399

cards<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:32.829> know<00:02:32.950> they<00:02:33.069> give<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.430> two<00:02:33.700> jokers

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409

to<00:02:35.409> use<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.769> play<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.190> sometimes<00:02:36.970> there<00:02:37.209> are

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
to use in play and sometimes there are

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.149 
to use in play and sometimes there are
some<00:02:37.720> card<00:02:37.989> games<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.470> utilize<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.980> Joker

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
some card games that utilize the Joker

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.190 
some card games that utilize the Joker
so<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.549> nice<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.989> Joker's<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.079> can

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.910 
so it's nice to have Joker's you can
actually<00:02:41.409> use<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:43.239> pips<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.560> fonts

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
themselves kind of feel chunky to me a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.509 
themselves kind of feel chunky to me a
little<00:02:47.049> bloated<00:02:47.379> they<00:02:48.040> almost<00:02:48.160> look<00:02:48.489> like

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
little bloated they almost look like

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.610

they're low vision but they're not quite
that<00:02:50.920> big<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.670> they<00:02:52.569> kind<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.930> an

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
that big so they kind of have an

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.610 
that big so they kind of have an
expanded<00:02:53.819> insulated<00:02:54.819> image<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.900> red<00:02:56.170> is

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
expanded insulated image and the red is

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.349 
expanded insulated image and the red is
more<00:02:58.200> sharp<00:02:59.200> not<00:03:00.099> bright<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.120> more<00:03:01.239> of

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
more sharp not bright so it's more of

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.300 
more sharp not bright so it's more of
like<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.510> deep<00:03:01.810> red<00:03:02.079> not<00:03:02.530> necessarily<00:03:03.069> blood

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
like a deep red not necessarily blood

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.580
