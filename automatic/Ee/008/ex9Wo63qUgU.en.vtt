00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
different shock spring or fork spring

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.130 
different shock spring or fork spring
once<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.460> have<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.700> proper<00:02:06.969> fork<00:02:07.450> spring<00:02:07.810> or

once you have the proper fork spring or
shock<00:02:08.170> spring<00:02:08.619> determine<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.369> next<00:02:09.729> thing<00:02:09.970> is

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
shock spring determine the next thing is

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.809 
shock spring determine the next thing is
the<00:02:10.750> rebound<00:02:11.200> screw<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.740> on<00:02:11.860> most<00:02:12.160> upside

the rebound screw that on most upside

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.750 
the rebound screw that on most upside
down<00:02:13.000> fork<00:02:13.390> sits<00:02:13.690> right<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:13.990> top<00:02:14.350> if<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.430> screw

approximately<00:03:32.830> two<00:03:33.490> and<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> half<00:03:33.910> inches

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.390 

less<00:03:39.209> sag<00:03:39.599> makes<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.379> bike<00:03:40.590> actually<00:03:40.830> steer

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
less sag makes the bike actually steer

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.240 
less sag makes the bike actually steer
sharper<00:03:42.000> because<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.480> bike<00:03:42.660> goes<00:03:42.989> down<00:03:43.379> not

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
sharper because the bike goes down not

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.910 
sharper because the bike goes down not
as<00:03:44.550> far<00:03:44.819> so<00:03:45.510> it's<00:03:45.629> more<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> tricycle<00:03:46.440> if

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
as far so it's more like a tricycle if

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.710 
as far so it's more like a tricycle if
you<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.220> imagine<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.000> front<00:03:48.269> ends<00:03:48.510> more

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
you can imagine that the front ends more

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.630 
you can imagine that the front ends more
straight<00:03:49.110> up<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.470> down<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.310> steers

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
straight up and down so it steers

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.520 
straight up and down so it steers
sharper<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.629> like<00:03:51.750> an<00:03:51.900> indoor<00:03:52.260> track

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
sharper so for like an indoor track

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.800 
sharper so for like an indoor track
you'd<00:03:53.280> only<00:03:53.430> want<00:03:53.610> two<00:03:53.940> inches<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.540> sag

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
you'd only want two inches of sag

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.380 
you'd only want two inches of sag

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
choppy one you might want three inches

choppy one you might want three inches
of<00:03:59.580> sag<00:03:59.819> where<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.209> goes<00:04:00.360> down<00:04:00.569> further<00:04:00.989> and
