of<00:02:14.370> how<00:02:14.610> it's<00:02:15.450> kind<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> feeling<00:02:16.200> like

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
of how it's kind of feeling like

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.520 
of how it's kind of feeling like
Assassin's<00:02:17.040> playstyles<00:02:17.610> going<00:02:18.030> towards<00:02:18.530> I've

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
Assassin's playstyles going towards I've

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.590 
Assassin's playstyles going towards I've
also<00:02:19.740> seen<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.340> double<00:02:20.670> dps<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.270> healer

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
also seen like double dps on healer

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.350 
also seen like double dps on healer
Marauder<00:02:22.470> split<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.490> know<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> triple<00:02:24.030> DPS

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
Marauder split you know a triple DPS

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.930 
Marauder split you know a triple DPS
comp<00:02:24.630> splitting<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.530> AoE<00:02:25.890> then<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.550> DPS

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
comp splitting just AoE then the DPS

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.440 
comp splitting just AoE then the DPS
conversion

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
conversion

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.720 
conversion
it<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.470> would<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:28.680> definitely<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.250> couple

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
it so it would be definitely a couple

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.119 
it so it would be definitely a couple
strategies<00:02:30.239> I'll<00:02:30.660> cover<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> 1

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
strategies I'll cover but that's the 1

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.890 
strategies I'll cover but that's the 1
i've<00:02:32.220> been<00:02:32.250> using<00:02:32.400> mostly<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.420> now<00:02:33.599> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
i've been using mostly right now and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.600 
i've been using mostly right now and
i'll<00:02:34.530> definitely<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.010> some<00:02:35.099> videos<00:02:35.370> later

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
i'll definitely have some videos later

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.490 
i'll definitely have some videos later
when<00:02:35.849> we<00:02:35.940> start<00:02:36.180> doing<00:02:36.390> more<00:02:36.540> group<00:02:36.840> play<00:02:37.170> when

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
when we start doing more group play when

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.559 
when we start doing more group play when
we<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.800> into<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.269> strategies<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
we can get into the strategies of the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.960 
we can get into the strategies of the
arena<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.040> far<00:02:41.190> first<00:02:41.430> impressions

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
arena but so far first impressions

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.960

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
really enjoying it soloq i wish i had

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.400 
really enjoying it soloq i wish i had
waited<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.360> little<00:02:45.450> bit<00:02:45.690> longer<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:46.019> year

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
waited a little bit longer for year

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.680 
waited a little bit longer for year
because<00:02:47.099> how<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.370> 10<00:02:47.730> games<00:02:48.060> play<00:02:48.480> out<00:02:48.660> your

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
because how the 10 games play out your

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.100 
because how the 10 games play out your
first<00:02:49.080> ten<00:02:49.470> kind<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.370> give<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:51.660> know<00:02:51.810> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
first ten kind of give you a you know a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.070 
first ten kind of give you a you know a
nice<00:02:52.620> boost<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.310> writing<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.630> started<00:02:54.930> out

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
nice boost in writing so I started out

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.530 
nice boost in writing so I started out
about<00:02:55.260> 300<00:02:55.920> points<00:02:56.099> probably<00:02:56.940> lower<00:02:57.239> than

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
about 300 points probably lower than

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.160 
about 300 points probably lower than
most<00:02:57.720> people<00:02:58.080> would<00:02:58.170> feel<00:02:58.379> girls<00:02:58.890> star<00:02:59.160> down

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
most people would feel girls star down

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.210 
most people would feel girls star down
so<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.440> kind<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.739> little<00:03:01.950> bit<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.160> a

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
so that was kind of a little bit of a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.650 
so that was kind of a little bit of a
bummer<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:02.880> too<00:03:03.060> much<00:03:03.180> worried<00:03:03.540> about

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
bummer I'm not too much worried about

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.720 
bummer I'm not too much worried about
the<00:03:03.780> cellular<00:03:04.170> Q<00:03:04.380> rating<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:05.040> because<00:03:05.280> even

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
the cellular Q rating just because even

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.970 
the cellular Q rating just because even
the<00:03:05.790> top<00:03:05.970> players<00:03:06.329> are<00:03:06.660> about<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.140> 60-percent

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the top players are about a 60-percent

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.860 
the top players are about a 60-percent
win<00:03:08.130> ratio<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.970> just<00:03:09.090> kind<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.840> know

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
win ratio so it's just kind of you know

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.190 
win ratio so it's just kind of you know
where<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.560> chips<00:03:10.829> fall<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:12.630> it's<00:03:12.750> still<00:03:12.900> fun

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
where the chips fall but it's still fun

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.470 
where the chips fall but it's still fun

just<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.580> rage<00:03:52.820> people<00:03:53.330> have<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.660> really

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
just the rage people have is really

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.530 
just the rage people have is really
funny<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.410> me<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.860> guess<00:03:55.820> they're<00:03:56.060> not<00:03:56.180> used<00:03:56.420> to

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
funny to me I guess they're not used to

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.060 
funny to me I guess they're not used to
playing<00:03:56.660> other<00:03:56.930> games<00:03:57.020> that<00:03:57.380> marinas<00:03:58.040> and

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
playing other games that marinas and

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.760 
playing other games that marinas and
seeing<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.970> imbalances<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.720> then<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:00.650> know

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
seeing the imbalances and then you know

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.830 
seeing the imbalances and then you know
the<00:04:00.860> kind<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.100> fun<00:04:01.340> bracket<00:04:01.910> because<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
the kind of fun bracket because the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.440

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
it's a fairly good system a good

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.080 
it's a fairly good system a good
starting<00:04:31.100> point<00:04:31.310> let's<00:04:31.550> put<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:31.880> way<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.060> very

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
starting point let's put that way a very

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.240 
starting point let's put that way a very
good<00:04:32.600> starting<00:04:32.960> point<00:04:33.200> with<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.410> arenas<00:04:33.830> and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
good starting point with the arenas and

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.030 
good starting point with the arenas and
I'm<00:04:34.820> pleased<00:04:35.210> with<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.480> so<00:04:35.690> far<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:36.740> course

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
I'm pleased with it so far of course

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.950 
I'm pleased with it so far of course
they<00:04:37.250> always<00:04:37.400> be<00:04:37.640> complaint<00:04:38.060> updates<00:04:38.720> needed

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
they always be complaint updates needed

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960 
they always be complaint updates needed
but<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.410> think<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:39.740> is<00:04:39.890> a<00:04:39.919> good<00:04:40.220> direction<00:04:40.430> for

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
but I think this is a good direction for

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.840 
but I think this is a good direction for
the<00:04:41.030> game<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:42.350> just<00:04:42.530> needs<00:04:42.710> to<00:04:43.040> you<00:04:43.550> know<00:04:43.580> go

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
the game it just needs to you know go

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.580 
the game it just needs to you know go
through<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> good<00:04:44.390> patches<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:44.960> nerves<00:04:45.380> and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
through a good patches of nerves and

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.560 
through a good patches of nerves and
buffs<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.040> balancing<00:04:46.640> I<00:04:46.850> think<00:04:47.180> we<00:04:47.270> should<00:04:47.450> be

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
buffs and balancing I think we should be

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.930 
buffs and balancing I think we should be
good<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> go<00:04:48.100> but<00:04:49.100> more<00:04:49.250> videos<00:04:49.550> coming<00:04:49.760> out
