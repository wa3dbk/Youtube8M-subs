00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.469

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
wouldn't actually recommend these

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.740 
wouldn't actually recommend these
because<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.020> pretty<00:01:43.470> fast

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
because they kind of go out pretty fast

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.910 
because they kind of go out pretty fast
well<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.840> much<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.259> use<00:01:46.409> them<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.740> usually

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
well as much as I use them and I usually

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
well as much as I use them and I usually
use<00:01:47.220> them<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.549> ordered<00:01:50.549> about<00:01:50.909> six

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
use them a lot but I ordered about six
of<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.810> didn't<00:01:52.259> order<00:01:52.409> them<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.710> bought<00:01:52.890> about

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
of I didn't order them I bought about

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
of I didn't order them I bought about
six<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.579> these<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.030> most<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.509> have

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
six of these and most of them have

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.870 
six of these and most of them have
pretty<00:01:55.320> much<00:01:55.439> died<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.979> already

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pretty much died out already

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.130 
pretty much died out already
and<00:01:59.299> then<00:02:00.299> there's<00:02:02.360> recollections<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.780> these

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and then there's recollections and these

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740 
and then there's recollections and these
are<00:02:04.290> actually<00:02:04.740> pretty<00:02:04.890> good<00:02:05.159> pens<00:02:05.540> this<00:02:06.540> one

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
are actually pretty good pens this one

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.590 
are actually pretty good pens this one
is<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.229> still<00:02:07.530> works<00:02:07.770> really<00:02:08.009> well

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.030 

so<00:02:11.600> this<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.260> actually<00:02:12.590> good<00:02:12.710> it's<00:02:12.890> actually

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
so this is actually good it's actually

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.210 
so this is actually good it's actually
expensive<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.890> remember<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> price

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
expensive I think I remember the price

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.790 
expensive I think I remember the price
for<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.510> would<00:02:18.080> only<00:02:18.110> had<00:02:18.410> enough<00:02:18.650> money

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
for it but I would only had enough money

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.500 
for it but I would only had enough money
to<00:02:18.950> buy<00:02:19.040> one<00:02:19.430> at<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.670> time<00:02:19.940> because<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.330> bought

my most recent pen and it's starting to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.979 
my most recent pen and it's starting to
die<00:03:10.880> because<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.480> use<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.020> for<00:03:12.380> everything<00:03:13.989> but

die because I use it for everything but
that's<00:03:15.470> just<00:03:15.650> because<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:16.160> use<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.550> lot<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.060> I

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
should probably stop using it so much

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:28.720 
should probably stop using it so much
and<00:03:19.810> after<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.870> inked<00:03:21.110> them<00:03:21.440> hold<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:27.459> okay<00:03:28.459> I'm

the<00:05:00.919> darkest<00:05:01.340> ten<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.270> own<00:05:03.070> like<00:05:04.070> B<00:05:04.370> stands<00:05:04.940> for

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
the darkest ten I own like B stands for

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.330 
the darkest ten I own like B stands for
black<00:05:05.389> I<00:05:05.630> think<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.350> higher<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.680> number

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
black I think and the higher the number

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.529 
black I think and the higher the number
the<00:05:07.370> darker<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:08.150> is<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:09.430> let's<00:05:10.430> see<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:11.330> have<00:05:11.479> a

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
the darker it is and let's see to have a

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.719 
the darker it is and let's see to have a
different<00:05:11.960> kind<00:05:12.110> HB<00:05:13.100> is<00:05:13.340> kind<00:05:13.699> of<00:05:13.820> like<00:05:15.729> and

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
different kind HB is kind of like and

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.240 
different kind HB is kind of like and
where'd<00:05:17.570> it<00:05:17.660> go<00:05:18.729> it's<00:05:19.990> like<00:05:20.990> H<00:05:21.620> stands<00:05:22.100> for

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
where'd it go it's like H stands for

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.279 
where'd it go it's like H stands for
hard<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:22.820> think<00:05:22.910> and<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.479> harder<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.960> pen<00:05:24.139> is

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
hard I think and the harder the pen is

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.620 
hard I think and the harder the pen is
the<00:05:24.320> lighter<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.950> is<00:05:25.160> so<00:05:26.000> that's<00:05:26.210> kind<00:05:26.450> of<00:05:26.479> like

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
the lighter it is so that's kind of like

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.360 
the lighter it is so that's kind of like
in<00:05:26.840> between<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.500> let's<00:05:27.800> see<00:05:27.979> um<00:05:30.820> see<00:05:31.820> H<00:05:32.120> here<00:05:32.630> is

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
in between so let's see um see H here is

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.020 
in between so let's see um see H here is
light<00:05:34.370> but<00:05:35.000> 2h<00:05:35.570> is<00:05:35.870> lighter<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.460> if<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.669> really

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
light but 2h is lighter so if I really

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.550 
light but 2h is lighter so if I really
wanted<00:05:38.270> something<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.599> go<00:05:38.750> from<00:05:38.990> dark<00:05:39.320> to

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
wanted something to go from dark to

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.469 
wanted something to go from dark to
light<00:05:39.680> I<00:05:40.039> would<00:05:40.130> probably<00:05:40.460> start<00:05:40.820> with<00:05:40.910> I

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
light I would probably start with I

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.529 
light I would probably start with I
don't<00:05:42.470> know<00:05:42.620> 4b<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.840> go<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:45.410> B<00:05:45.620> then<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.550> HB

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
don't know 4b and go to to B then to HB

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.640 
don't know 4b and go to to B then to HB
and<00:05:47.960> then<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:49.039> H<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.479> then<00:05:50.599> to<00:05:50.810> H<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.320> that

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
and then to H and then to H and that

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.290 
and then to H and then to H and that
would<00:05:51.770> get<00:05:51.949> pretty<00:05:52.250> much<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.430> lighter<00:05:52.820> effect

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
would get pretty much a lighter effect

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.860 
would get pretty much a lighter effect
and<00:05:54.039> I<00:05:55.039> don't<00:05:55.099> really<00:05:55.460> prefer<00:05:55.970> either<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.630> don't

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
and I don't really prefer either I don't

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.719 
and I don't really prefer either I don't
like<00:05:57.169> have<00:05:57.410> a<00:05:57.470> favorite<00:05:57.979> out<00:05:58.099> of<00:05:58.250> either<00:05:58.460> one
