end<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> spectrum<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.669> just<00:00:26.970> high<00:00:27.450> speed

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
end of the spectrum it's just high speed

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.070 
end of the spectrum it's just high speed
flat<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.560> top<00:00:29.039> gear<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.610> um<00:00:30.000> yeah<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
flat out top gear it's um yeah it's a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.049 
flat out top gear it's um yeah it's a
complete<00:00:31.410> contrast<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> race<00:00:32.309> itself<00:00:32.669> but

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
complete contrast to the race itself but

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.570 
complete contrast to the race itself but
it's<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.440> important<00:00:34.949> because<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
it's it's so important because the

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.390 
it's it's so important because the

better time you get in the prologue the
you<00:00:39.360> save<00:00:39.600> yourself<00:00:39.720> a<00:00:40.320> lot<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.530> traffic<00:00:40.830> in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you save yourself a lot of traffic in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
know it's got a little kick start on it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.870 
know it's got a little kick start on it
and<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.810> try<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.189> just<00:01:11.189> start<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.580> any

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and you try and just start it like any

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.600 
and you try and just start it like any
other<00:01:12.000> bike<00:01:12.390> what's<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.720> foot<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.080> there

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.270 

it<00:01:17.390> doesn't<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.020> generally<00:01:18.680> won't<00:01:18.800> go<00:01:19.010> every

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
it doesn't it generally won't go every

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.610 
it doesn't it generally won't go every
time<00:01:19.490> but<00:01:19.850> basically<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.930> just<00:01:20.960> get<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.320> swing

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
time but basically you just get a swing

as far as the pipe goes last year I
didn't<00:02:53.760> run<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.909> pipe<00:02:54.150> yard<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.980> pipe<00:02:56.189> was

didn't run a pipe yard the pipe was

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.000 
didn't run a pipe yard the pipe was
smashed<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.939> bits<00:02:56.969> it<00:02:57.599> was<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:58.530> hanging<00:02:58.889> in

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.890 
smashed to bits it was just hanging in
there<00:02:59.219> but<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.969> didn't<00:03:00.299> affect<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:00.659> bikes

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
there but it didn't affect the bikes

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.890 
there but it didn't affect the bikes
power<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.889> it<00:03:02.760> wasn't<00:03:03.180> an<00:03:03.269> issue<00:03:03.389> so<00:03:03.810> I'm

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
power and and it wasn't an issue so I'm

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.129 
power and and it wasn't an issue so I'm
not<00:03:04.109> I'm<00:03:04.530> not<00:03:04.590> concerned<00:03:05.519> about<00:03:06.079> running<00:03:07.079> a

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
not I'm not concerned about running a

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.740 
not I'm not concerned about running a
pipe<00:03:07.349> guard<00:03:07.620> or<00:03:07.769> anything<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.849> think<00:03:09.209> I've

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
pipe guard or anything that I think I've

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.780 
pipe guard or anything that I think I've
got<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.019> bit<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.379> skid<00:03:10.680> plate<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.459> should

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
got a bit of a skid plate that should

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.399 
got a bit of a skid plate that should
just<00:03:11.819> think<00:03:12.359> this<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.719> quite<00:03:12.930> well<00:03:13.139> tucked

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
just think this is quite well tucked

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.940 
just think this is quite well tucked
away<00:03:13.590> anyway<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.219> water<00:03:14.370> pump<00:03:15.620> one<00:03:16.620> there's

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
away anyway the water pump one there's

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.970 
away anyway the water pump one there's
one<00:03:17.129> issue<00:03:17.250> with<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.700> rocks<00:03:17.939> if<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:19.739> you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
one issue with the rocks if if you

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.369 
one issue with the rocks if if you
puncture<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.400> radiators<00:03:21.060> yeah<00:03:21.389> it's<00:03:22.200> all

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
puncture the radiators yeah it's all

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.379 
puncture the radiators yeah it's all
over<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.099> get<00:03:23.459> pretty<00:03:23.700> much<00:03:23.819> guaranteed<00:03:24.359> to

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
over you get pretty much guaranteed to

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.709 
over you get pretty much guaranteed to
bend<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> discs<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:26.329> actually<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.359> didn't<00:03:27.629> even

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:27.719 
bend the discs so actually I didn't even

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.899 
bend the discs so actually I didn't even
have<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.989> shifter<00:03:28.469> last<00:03:28.980> year<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.340> found<00:03:29.760> a

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
have a shifter last year I found a

coolant<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.709> they<00:03:46.709> claim<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.340> just

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
coolant and they claim that it just

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.770 
coolant and they claim that it just
absolutely<00:03:48.120> will<00:03:48.900> not<00:03:48.930> boil<00:03:49.409> and<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:51.209> that's

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
absolutely will not boil and that that's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.569 
absolutely will not boil and that that's
that<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.439> a<00:03:52.469> big<00:03:52.739> key<00:03:52.949> to<00:03:53.340> getting

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
that that is a big key to getting

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.879 
that that is a big key to getting
