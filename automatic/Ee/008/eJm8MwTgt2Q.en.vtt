00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:08.450
 So why don't we decide to possess gold 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.129
 cf I forgot I was not alone 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:19.070
 It is big to be able to see after all after seeing comment and noticed 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:20.880
 Above all, if you look at the comments, you'll come up with energy, so whether the rainy season will also start from the decision 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.870
 What a cf scattered at 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 Garlic 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:32.790
 It is horrible if Bame you did not know that you were destined for chaos 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.040
 cf Chitte to say ze thing of the critical fumble house or Sword World 2.0 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.210
 But there were no 4 cities 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.890
 Gonna do not know to say I decided to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.680
 The c and f values ​​are originally fixed. 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.309
 Seems Do Boehm drpg Datoshi 1 good edge was doing with you was what made 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.120
 Well, if it is action judgment of Sword World 2.0 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:00.309
 Automatic success in 6 Zoro If it is Pin Zoro , it is an automatic failure 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.880
 If it is a battle act , setting per weapon Cthulhu shakes with 1 d 100 96 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:08.840
 From 00 are fans 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:10.130
 01 from 05 is of critical Neun roughly trpg which is set from the beginning 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.630
 There are many cases 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.480
 But if it is a night wizard, shake 2 b 6 before the session 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.050
 Meeting to determine c value and f value 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.860
 By the way , people in the time of the first to do this are bare hands 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:30.590
 I'm sorry I do not know it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.100
 If the value of c is 2 f and the value of 7 gets out, I can not get my eyes, but there is also a remedy. 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.700
 Follow 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.470
 Russia decided I sometimes cf correction value that determines the ability value 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.740
 This will move cf land by cf shoe 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.550
 + Can do it ze for example, tf correction value can have a 3 c value was 8 f Negako 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.820
 Try 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:54.690
 You can be the first to give moving two what edge in this case 7 Press to 2 move 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.490
 By the way, not to make a switch Poi edge in the same numbers 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.979
 It is a very peaky system but this 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:06.670
 Sometimes even bad if when good employees Datte ordinary human'll think that it is interesting 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:12.099
 I wonder if it should be reflected in the game 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:16.360
 The fate of chaos of Reimu characters ' class great thing is cf when deciding the land 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:22.740
 Thing in Tsu get to decide the 1 f value by two 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.740
 I'll decide right away if I get the same numbers I'll re- do 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.310
 I am 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:35.200
 It's a good feeling for the decided maiden and Ayame 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.129
 It is also good to say that if you say that the f-value of the maiden is not 12, it's better 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.510
 But 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:44.349
 The probability is the same but the f value is better for lower eyes 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.060
 Kodama a is the fate of pom pom 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.170
 This is my chosen path , Zoo 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.459
 Well it is good that former Isa not kun high spirit is good 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.750
 Kimiurai Mae no Merida p Is not this healer or Dife 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:05.480
 A word I heard somewhere, but you are following your cancer molecular wire 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.050
 I will receive damage if the rim comes out in the hit judgment This is my chosen path 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.670
 Somehow possession 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:15.290
 Let's decide the money, so this roll is not a judge, so even if the f value comes out 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.290
 It will not be treated as an ampoule 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:30.250
 Even if it is a mistress, is it the lowest value or is it not possible to spend money ? 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.299
 No, I 'm sure I 'm not going to be a high school student to get money or a new year's gift 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.579
 I guess 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:39.530
 I wonder if you think I parents who do not want to bother to Uco Ya Naa good 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:43.819
 Pre-play takes more time than I thought 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.600
 But I'll do game So everyone like viewers 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.600

 Hmm 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.650
 goo 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.160
 me 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.870
 That's why yesterday is today 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:18.320
 I will try to respond to what was written in the comment 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:20.840
 At this stage, people inside have a strange tension because the number of plays has risen more than expected 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.500
 Good Oh So one day of Iizo 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:29.460
 call of cthulhu many Do Kupuru flip Re Mozo or here plunged Science 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.240
 I did not think the route Mark pull waving and it's minor 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.540
 Sword World 2.0 if you think from the price and affordability 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.280
 There will be many people who started with 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:45.490
 It was a demonbated sand that triggered the shipment of the existence of Cthulhu 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:50.319
 master of Necro pedophile cool the way return 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:56.770
 The picture may be divided, but as 0 rpg chaos flare and 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:06:03.069
 I like a system like a bancho Especially chaotic flare is not only a flare system 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:05.510
 Frontal and one is chaos of that hodgepodge feeling favorite flower of the size difference of about me or suparobo 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:11.300
 When doing flares while making your face red 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:13.700
 I'm playing role-played in the second half of the session, maybe because of the leaf tension. 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.050
 Te strange role-play Do not begin to do 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.530
 Oh 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:23.440
 The first point is that the Cthulph rate was high in the face of the fact that he or she could not get lost 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:29.770
 Because it was well-known in Nico Nico 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:33.039
 It was the second best video candidate and it was the best of the crowd 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.040
 Such a system would require less explanation 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.130
 The person inside is also 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:42.260
 I've been there so I'm going smoothly 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:46.370
 On the contrary, because the person in the night wizard is also the first time, also with the meaning of confirmation 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:51.860
 Please understand that the explanation is a video with many 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:54.030
 Nico name your own picture is on the right bun was borrowed from the nail's 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.370
 Because it is a wonderful business meeting 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:00.000
 Write to, but I thought that was the pillar to try to use to differentiate players and Characterization 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.600
 Was 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.260
 Sanae was the most popular among them 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:11.910
 It'll Well wow It is of course Fufu Sanae 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.090
 After all the time is different, and increase the honor to be raised with everyone 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:20.550
 Yeah done 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.620
 Yo please stop another server to Oh 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.040

 Come on her a 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:35.129
 Oh yeah 早 井 井 瑛 5 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:42.270
 Or say 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:47.969
 Conducive is in the people in the rest is a creature wearing a longitudinal data with big tits and wearing glasses 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:48.839
 Furthermore, it seems that if the mini-ska is good even with red-haired long, the semon night sequel will come out 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:55.120
 It is 

00:07:48.839 --> 00:08:00.850
 What Constitution or this time I think 2 or even unpleasant flow which said it this Hende 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:04.949
 It is not a question-and-answer session, but I want to do something like this at 9 regular intervals 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.949
 Thank you for watching
