archaeology guides are really pretty

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.229 
archaeology guides are really pretty
complicated<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.920> there's<00:00:47.820> no<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
complicated because there's no way to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.540 
complicated because there's no way to
100%<00:00:48.750> guarantee<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.800> whatever<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
leveling archaeology you're not going to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
leveling archaeology you're not going to
find<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> proven<00:01:08.430> problematic

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
there's no way to guarantee it drops

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
there's no way to guarantee it drops

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.180 
to know how they work I've had a lot of
questions<00:03:50.190> related<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.639> archaeology<00:03:51.329> and

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
questions related to archaeology and

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.039 
questions related to archaeology and
water<00:03:53.190> rune<00:03:53.459> stones<00:03:53.880> what<00:03:54.209> are<00:03:54.329> key<00:03:54.450> stones<00:03:54.750> we

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
water rune stones what are key stones we

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.729 
water rune stones what are key stones we
roll<00:03:55.349> tablets<00:03:55.859> what<00:03:56.489> do<00:03:56.609> these<00:03:56.730> do<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.560> will

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
roll tablets what do these do so I will

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.729 
roll tablets what do these do so I will
add<00:03:59.160> an<00:03:59.459> explanation<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.299> what<00:04:00.540> they<00:04:00.660> do<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:01.049> my

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
add an explanation to what they do in my

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.009 
add an explanation to what they do in my
video<00:04:02.599> now<00:04:03.599> as<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.440> turns<00:04:04.620> out<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:05.180> lot<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
video now as it turns out a lot of the

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.170 
video now as it turns out a lot of the
potential<00:04:07.859> salts<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.609> get<00:04:08.849> from

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
potential salts that you can get from

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.800 
potential salts that you can get from
non-fossil<00:04:09.889> archaeology<00:04:11.480> might<00:04:12.480> have<00:04:12.780> a

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
non-fossil archaeology might have a

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.140 
non-fossil archaeology might have a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
chance of having a slot for a key stone

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.390 
chance of having a slot for a key stone
of<00:04:15.299> some<00:04:15.450> sort<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.930> here's<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.950> slot<00:04:17.190> over

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
of some sort and here's the slot over

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
here in the bottom left now what the key

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.460 
here in the bottom left now what the key
stone<00:04:20.099> does<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.959> if<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.469> are<00:04:22.650> able<00:04:22.890> to

Shadow Priests on dude if you can solve
it<00:04:32.960> with<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.350> Keystone<00:04:33.890> then<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:34.880> can<00:04:35.030> put<00:04:35.360> a

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
it with a Keystone then you can put a

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.230 
it with a Keystone then you can put a
keystone<00:04:35.750> into<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.110> slot<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:37.150> perform<00:04:38.150> the

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
keystone into that slot and perform the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.210 
keystone into that slot and perform the
salt<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.750> can<00:04:39.110> also<00:04:39.260> put<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.530> keystone<00:04:39.980> into

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
salt you can also put a keystone into

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.400 
salt you can also put a keystone into
the<00:04:40.340> slot<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.700> get<00:04:40.850> free<00:04:41.060> fragments<00:04:41.630> if<00:04:41.990> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
the slot to get free fragments if the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.040 
the slot to get free fragments if the
fragments<00:04:42.830> bleed<00:04:43.070> over<00:04:43.430> or<00:04:43.700> if<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.450> have<00:04:44.930> it

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
fragments bleed over or if you have it

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.100 
fragments bleed over or if you have it
full<00:04:45.290> already<00:04:45.650> so<00:04:46.370> basically<00:04:46.720> as<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.870> can<00:04:47.990> see

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
full already so basically as you can see

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.100 
full already so basically as you can see
I<00:04:48.170> only<00:04:48.230> have<00:04:48.410> 23<00:04:49.060> fragments<00:04:50.060> right<00:04:50.180> now<00:04:50.420> out

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
I only have 23 fragments right now out

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.170 
I only have 23 fragments right now out
of<00:04:51.320> 35<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.920> I<00:04:51.980> would<00:04:52.130> need<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.580> make<00:04:52.880> this

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
of 35 that I would need to make this

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.540 
of 35 that I would need to make this
salt<00:04:53.480> if<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:54.080> had<00:04:54.260> 35<00:04:54.710> already<00:04:55.040> I<00:04:55.100> could<00:04:55.340> still

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
salt if I had 35 already I could still

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.030 
salt if I had 35 already I could still
put<00:04:55.730> a<00:04:55.790> Keystone<00:04:56.270> in<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:56.620> after<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.650> perform

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
put a Keystone in and after I perform

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.830 
put a Keystone in and after I perform
the<00:04:58.130> solve<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.580> would<00:04:59.000> just<00:04:59.120> have<00:04:59.300> 12<00:04:59.660> extra

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
the solve I would just have 12 extra

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.770 
the solve I would just have 12 extra
fragments<00:05:00.290> left<00:05:00.410> over<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.270> as<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.300> result<00:05:02.660> of

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
fragments left over and as a result of

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.860 
fragments left over and as a result of
this<00:05:02.930> pretty<00:05:03.830> much<00:05:04.010> when<00:05:04.190> you're<00:05:04.310> leveling

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
this pretty much when you're leveling

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.710 
this pretty much when you're leveling
you<00:05:05.870> want<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.230> use<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:07.180> rune<00:05:08.180> stone<00:05:08.210> or<00:05:08.600> key

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
you want to use a rune stone or key

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.110 
you want to use a rune stone or key
stone<00:05:08.960> or<00:05:09.110> whatever<00:05:09.200> it<00:05:09.530> is<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:09.890> have

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
stone or whatever it is that you have

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.760 
stone or whatever it is that you have
pretty<00:05:11.120> much<00:05:11.210> every<00:05:11.630> time<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.110> are<00:05:12.140> presented

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
pretty much every time you are presented

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.920 
pretty much every time you are presented
the<00:05:12.860> option<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:14.120> use<00:05:14.270> one<00:05:14.450> good<00:05:14.630> because<00:05:14.810> you

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
the option to use one good because you

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.010 
the option to use one good because you
can't<00:05:15.110> do<00:05:15.200> this<00:05:15.320> every<00:05:15.500> time<00:05:15.790> so<00:05:16.790> I'm<00:05:17.510> going<00:05:17.990> to

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
can't do this every time so I'm going to

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.659 
can't do this every time so I'm going to
put<00:05:18.320> it<00:05:18.410> in<00:05:18.500> right<00:05:18.710> now<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:18.860> have<00:05:19.070> just<00:05:19.340> enough

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
put it in right now I have just enough

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.760 
put it in right now I have just enough
to<00:05:19.850> make<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.150> particular<00:05:20.480> salt<00:05:21.669> so<00:05:23.770> there

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
to make this particular salt so there

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.370 
to make this particular salt so there
and<00:05:25.040> I<00:05:25.940> solved<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.230> staff<00:05:28.160> thingy<00:05:28.520> whatever

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
and I solved the staff thingy whatever

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.630 
and I solved the staff thingy whatever
now<00:05:30.380> another<00:05:30.680> thing<00:05:30.770> that<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.250> should<00:05:31.520> talk

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
now another thing that I should talk

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.480 
now another thing that I should talk
about<00:05:31.970> is<00:05:32.680> skill<00:05:33.680> ups<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.040> how<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.160> skill<00:05:34.460> up

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
about is skill ups and how to skill up

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.060 
about is skill ups and how to skill up
effectively<00:05:35.380> another<00:05:36.380> thing<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.740> noticed

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
effectively another thing that I noticed

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.530 
effectively another thing that I noticed
when<00:05:37.190> reading<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.610> comments<00:05:37.970> on<00:05:38.090> WoW<00:05:38.300> head

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
when reading the comments on WoW head

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.040 
when reading the comments on WoW head
discussing<00:05:39.470> archaeology<00:05:40.100> is<00:05:40.630> well<00:05:41.630> first<00:05:41.900> off

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
discussing archaeology is well first off

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.270 
discussing archaeology is well first off
every<00:05:42.350> time<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.560> get<00:05:42.680> us<00:05:42.770> all<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:43.010> get<00:05:43.130> five

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
every time you get us all to get five

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.340 
every time you get us all to get five
skill<00:05:43.550> ups<00:05:43.700> but<00:05:43.880> one<00:05:44.600> thing<00:05:44.780> that<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:44.930> noticed

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
skill ups but one thing that I noticed

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.200 
skill ups but one thing that I noticed
is<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.500> people<00:05:45.890> who<00:05:46.010> are<00:05:46.130> after<00:05:46.400> stuff<00:05:47.030> in

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
is the people who are after stuff in

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.850 
is the people who are after stuff in
like<00:05:47.360> fossil<00:05:47.780> archaeology<00:05:48.380> or<00:05:48.410> dwarf
