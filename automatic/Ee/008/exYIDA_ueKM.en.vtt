00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:04.040 
to add a small teaser first and then you
want<00:04:51.140> to<00:04:51.200> add<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.520> clue<00:04:52.790> on<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.570> bottom

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.549 

many<00:05:05.050> ones<00:05:05.199> who<00:05:05.349> set<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.009> do<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:06.729> right<00:05:07.559> we

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:08.559 
many ones who set this do this right we

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:12.390 
many ones who set this do this right we
had

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.430 

and<00:05:13.400> just<00:05:13.880> like<00:05:14.030> that<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.600> think<00:05:14.810> by<00:05:14.960> pressing

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
and just like that I think by pressing

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.780 
and just like that I think by pressing
from<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.770> bottom<00:05:16.130> because<00:05:16.220> they<00:05:16.490> don't<00:05:16.670> want

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
from the bottom because they don't want

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:24.930 
from the bottom because they don't want
us<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.090> get<00:05:17.780> sick<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.380> my<00:05:18.500> support

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.000 

and<00:05:25.390> now<00:05:26.080> we're<00:05:26.200> going<00:05:26.350> to<00:05:26.500> do<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:27.460> other<00:05:27.940> one

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.420 

on<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:40.960> bottom<00:05:41.379> and<00:05:41.560> if<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:41.800> cannot<00:05:42.009> find<00:05:42.249> it

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
on the bottom and if you cannot find it

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.119
