00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello today I come with a very short video 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 to show you something that you asked me 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.549
 a lot of people and it's about making 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.400
 trims for zippers 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.410
 the toiletry 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.910
 The materials we are going to use are the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.279
 own zip you will use in 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.880
 the toilet bag and two pieces of cloth from the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.020
 same fabric that you are going to use for 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.079
 make it and they have to be 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.590
 approximately 6 centimeters 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.920
 wide and long forgiveness and the width that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.800
 be approximately the same as the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.330
 zipper or a little bit more first thing 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.089
 what you have to do is place the 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.880
 right piece of cloth fabric 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:51.350
 against the right of the zipper 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.470
 a little bit below this tab and 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.980
 we are going to put a pin here 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.410
 to hold it 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.800
 and I will go to the machine to pass 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.560
 a position in this sense of for 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.940
 Cover the entire width of the zipper 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.320
 remember that if you are a little afraid 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.630
 because your machine does not have enough 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.950
 force and 3 that is going to get stuck around here 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.210
 you can sew with it with the steering wheel and 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.060
 then what we are going to do is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.910
 exactly the same on the other side the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.640
 I'm going to leave already prepared I open a little 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.510
 the zipper 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.180
 and maintaining 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.570
 the two even sides guiding me with 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.000
 these two tabs 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.700
 I'm going to put this like that a little bit more 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.120
 behind the tabs and I put a 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.120
 pin 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.210
 so that I do not escape, let's go to the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.649
 machine 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.649
 I'm going to pass the first seam 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.229
 you do not have to finish at the beginning in the 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.820
 final and as I told you before if you have 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.369
 afraid that your machine is not capable of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.819
 go through here just give it 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.239
 at the wheel towards you to pass by 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:11.660
 above and not that you do not break a 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.390
 Once I have this I remove the pin and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.390
 I'm going to pass a second seam 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.450
 putting the right fabric in this 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.819
 moment I can put to me for example I 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.880
 It is interesting that the first color you see 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.160
 be the pink and I leave it if you stretch it and 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.110
 It would completely look like this, so I can 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.580
 bend a little more inward to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.050
 that you see the first color that to me 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.150
 I'm interested 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.050
 I put it back in the machine either 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.050
 you need to finish 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.630
 we know again the full width of the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.490
 zipper 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.970
 with the other side I'm going to do exactly 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.970
 the same 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.690
 I'm going to change the pin so that 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.490
 leave room to pass press fabrics the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.490
 Dam width fabrics that do not bother me 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.070
 first seam 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.860
 I take out the pin and the second posture and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.470
 at this time I can go back to 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.780
 put the rose again in the first place 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.660
 the light pink 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.530
 so that the first one looks like I've 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.530
 done on the other side 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.150
 once we have it all sewn up 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.240
 what we are going to do is lift the cloth 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.069
 that we have put over and cut the 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.340
 zipper because this piece already we 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.500
 We have to cut this bit and now 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.810
 let's work with her as if this 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.120
 it was part of the zipper itself to the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.400
 time to make the bag what 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.680
 we will put as we always do right 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.690
 of the zipper with the right of the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.310
 we will place it like this and what 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.319
 we will use as if it were our own 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.510
 zipper you see that this is how 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.989
 rather prettier the termination is not 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.329
 see the metal tabs and also 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.900
 will give a better termination to the 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.640
 corner of your vanity case we have finished 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.110
 for today I hope it has served you all 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.430
 what I explained to you if you have any 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.430
 doubt counts in the comments
