135<00:00:55.530> pounds<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:57.059> division<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.930> does

easy in their victories when their

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.569

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
but broader definitely uh will be a star

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.490 
but broader definitely uh will be a star
in<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.560> future<00:02:55.950> I've<00:02:56.130> no<00:02:56.400> doubt<00:02:56.670> about<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.030> and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
in the future I've no doubt about it and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.250 
in the future I've no doubt about it and
I<00:02:58.500> think<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:58.800> could<00:02:58.950> clean<00:02:59.190> up<00:02:59.370> 135<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.510> 140

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
I think you could clean up 135 and 140

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.920 
I think you could clean up 135 and 140
so<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:02.550> going<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.850> be<00:03:02.910> tremendous<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.720> see

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
so it's going to be tremendous to see

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.190 
so it's going to be tremendous to see
him<00:03:04.140> grow<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> professional<00:03:04.830> fighter<00:03:05.520> and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
him grow as a professional fighter and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.360 
him grow as a professional fighter and
um<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:10.140> at<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> same<00:03:10.740> time<00:03:10.920> it's<00:03:11.130> so

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
um and this at the same time it's so

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.010 
um and this at the same time it's so
hard<00:03:11.790> not<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.120> compare<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.780> guy<00:03:12.960> to

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020
