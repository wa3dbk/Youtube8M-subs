00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
finally managed to break much as front

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970 
finally managed to break much as front
door<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.289> ground<00:00:31.590> units<00:00:31.890> the

door going in with the ground units the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620 
door going in with the ground units the
air<00:00:32.099> units<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.579> were<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.790> quite<00:00:33.420> working

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
air units just were not quite working

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
air units just were not quite working
going<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> combination<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.250> air<00:00:35.430> units

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
going in with a combination of air units

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.100 
going in with a combination of air units
and<00:00:35.850> grounding<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.270> finally<00:00:36.630> breaking<00:00:36.840> much

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and grounding it's finally breaking much

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.959 
and grounding it's finally breaking much
his<00:00:37.260> front<00:00:37.500> door<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.219> think<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
his front door and I think this is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.790 
his front door and I think this is
finally<00:00:39.570> curtains<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.079> much<00:00:40.260> he's<00:00:40.469> running

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
finally curtains for much he's running

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.040 
finally curtains for much he's running
out<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.920> minerals<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> island

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
out of minerals that is it is a island

out of minerals that is it is a island
expansion<00:00:43.920> he<00:00:44.670> does<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.649> two<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
expansion he does not have two of the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
expansion he does not have two of the
basis<00:00:47.190> anymore<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> bottom<00:00:48.180> right

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
squam-- point he only has that one base

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.119 
squam-- point he only has that one base
there<00:00:51.140> that<00:00:52.140> he's<00:00:52.260> mining<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.620> him<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.100> a

he still has a few left so you know
there's<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> last<00:01:02.370> four<00:01:02.670> minerals<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.149> much

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
there's the last four minerals of much

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
there's the last four minerals of much
as<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> island<00:01:04.049> expansion<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
as on the island expansion there this is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
as on the island expansion there this is
his<00:01:05.040> only<00:01:05.220> expansion<00:01:05.760> they're<00:01:05.880> showing<00:01:06.119> right

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
his only expansion they're showing right

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.320 
his only expansion they're showing right
now<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> mineral<00:01:08.369> only<00:01:08.549> natural<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
now the mineral only natural of the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.510 
now the mineral only natural of the
bottom<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:09.750> spawn<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> luxury<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.369> has

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
bottom right spawn and luxury just has

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
bottom right spawn and luxury just has
just<00:01:12.000> way<00:01:12.330> too<00:01:12.390> much<00:01:12.630> macro<00:01:13.080> power<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.439> this

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just way too much macro power at this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
just way too much macro power at this
point<00:01:13.799> much<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.060> able<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> produce

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
point much is not able to produce

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
point much is not able to produce
anything<00:01:15.869> basically<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.680> point<00:01:16.920> because

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
anything basically at this point because

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.240 
anything basically at this point because
of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> fact<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:18.170> he<00:01:19.170> doesn't<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.530> enough

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
of the fact that he doesn't have enough

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.969 
of the fact that he doesn't have enough
minerals<00:01:20.460> coming<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.330> anything<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:22.170> mean

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
minerals coming in to do anything I mean

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
minerals coming in to do anything I mean
you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.130> he's<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> lot<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.720> he's<00:01:24.720> got

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you know he's got a lot of he's got

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.620 
you know he's got a lot of he's got
three<00:01:25.320> gas<00:01:26.220> mines<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.790> guess<00:01:26.970> three<00:01:27.270> depleted

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
three gas mines I guess three depleted

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.929 
three gas mines I guess three depleted
gas<00:01:27.780> mine's<00:01:28.080> probably<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.759> going

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
gas mine's probably but it's not going

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.310 
gas mine's probably but it's not going
to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.119> enough<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.720> here<00:01:31.020> comes<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
to be enough and here here comes the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
to be enough and here here comes the
final<00:01:31.590> killing<00:01:32.070> blow<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> believe<00:01:32.900> hyjal<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
final killing blow I believe hyjal is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.539 
final killing blow I believe hyjal is
coming<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.560> killing<00:01:34.770> off<00:01:34.950> interceptors

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
coming in there killing off interceptors

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.429 
coming in there killing off interceptors
left<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.880> mind<00:01:36.060> devours<00:01:36.869> taking<00:01:37.259> care<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
left in mind devours taking care of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.999 
left in mind devours taking care of
those<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:39.900> couple<00:01:40.380> storms<00:01:40.770> going

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
those as well and a couple storms going

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
those as well and a couple storms going
off<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.659> quite<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
off but but it's just not quite going to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
off but but it's just not quite going to
be<00:01:43.259> enough<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.710> point<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.670> quite

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
be enough at this point just not quite

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
be enough at this point just not quite
enough<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.930> luxury<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.380> finally

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
enough and I think luxury is finally

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
enough and I think luxury is finally
finally<00:01:47.729> finally<00:01:47.759> after<00:01:48.270> 40<00:01:48.720> minutes<00:01:48.869> going

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
finally finally after 40 minutes going

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.789 
finally finally after 40 minutes going
to<00:01:49.170> take<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.470> game<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.850> ridiculous

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
to take this game this was ridiculous

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.260 
to take this game this was ridiculous
extremely<00:01:52.799> extremely<00:01:53.280> well<00:01:53.579> fought<00:01:53.880> by<00:01:54.090> both

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
extremely extremely well fought by both

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.920 
extremely extremely well fought by both
players<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.810> was

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
players and I I I think that it was

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.050 
players and I I I think that it was
within<00:01:58.200> much<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.680> graph<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.189> couple<00:01:59.460> points<00:01:59.729> in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
within much as graph a couple points in

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.450 
within much as graph a couple points in
during<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> course<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.899> game<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.380> uh

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
during the course of this game but uh

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.950 
during the course of this game but uh
you<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.610> could<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.630> quite

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
you know just could not quite

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.530 
you know just could not quite
cope<00:02:05.620> with<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.010> relentless<00:02:06.729> relentless<00:02:06.970> mac
