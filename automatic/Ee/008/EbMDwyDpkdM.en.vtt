issues<00:00:01.110> have<00:00:01.380> been<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.589> couple<00:00:02.040> people<00:00:02.280> have

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
issues have been a couple people have

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.510 
issues have been a couple people have
thought<00:00:02.850> that<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.300> large<00:00:03.659> vessel

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
thought that the large vessel

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.920 
thought that the large vessel
involvement<00:00:05.520> looks<00:00:05.879> similar<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> two

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
involvement looks similar in the two

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.169 
involvement looks similar in the two
diseases<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:08.040> have<00:00:08.189> wondered<00:00:08.610> why<00:00:08.820> there's

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
diseases and have wondered why there's

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.209 
diseases and have wondered why there's
this<00:00:09.389> difference<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.260> older<00:00:11.040> patients

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
this difference in older patients

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.610 
this difference in older patients
getting<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.240> set<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> diseases<00:00:12.929> including

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
getting one set of diseases including

the symptoms in the head the cranial
symptoms<00:00:17.010> which<00:00:17.580> aren't<00:00:17.820> common<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
symptoms which aren't common in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.529 
symptoms which aren't common in
takayasu's<00:00:19.730> people<00:00:20.730> who<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:20.939> done<00:00:21.150> studies

takayasu's people who have done studies
looking<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.439> pathology<00:00:22.619> taken<00:00:23.580> biopsy

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
looking at the pathology taken biopsy

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.540 
looking at the pathology taken biopsy
specimens<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> looking<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:26.220> under<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
specimens and looking at them under the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390 
specimens and looking at them under the
microscope<00:00:26.810> have<00:00:27.810> shown<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.470> what's<00:00:28.890> going

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
microscope have shown that what's going

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.089 
microscope have shown that what's going
on<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> blood<00:00:30.179> vessels<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:31.099> takayasu's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
on in the blood vessels in takayasu's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
on in the blood vessels in takayasu's
and<00:00:32.279> giant<00:00:32.550> cell<00:00:32.730> arteritis<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:33.660> similar

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and giant cell arteritis is very similar

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.950 
and giant cell arteritis is very similar
and<00:00:34.739> made<00:00:35.160> people<00:00:35.489> wonder<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:36.600> really

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and made people wonder are they really

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.979 
and made people wonder are they really
the<00:00:37.079> same<00:00:37.290> disease<00:00:37.969> this<00:00:38.969> study<00:00:39.270> looked<00:00:39.390> at

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the same disease this study looked at

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.310 
the same disease this study looked at
the<00:00:40.969> imaging<00:00:41.969> studies<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.140> had<00:00:43.290> been

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the imaging studies that had been

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.069 
the imaging studies that had been
performed<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.040> looking<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.079> angiograms

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
performed so looking at the angiograms

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.389 
performed so looking at the angiograms
and<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> past<00:00:46.800> these<00:00:47.010> might<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.340> been

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and the past these might have been

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.880 
and the past these might have been
angiograms<00:00:48.390> done<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> catheter<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> dye

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
angiograms done with a catheter and dye

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.430 
angiograms done with a catheter and dye
injected<00:00:50.640> into<00:00:50.910> an<00:00:51.030> artery<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.289> these

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
injected into an artery all of these

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.279 
injected into an artery all of these
were<00:00:52.680> done<00:00:52.829> using<00:00:53.129> mr<00:00:53.910> angiograms<00:00:54.690> magnetic

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
were done using mr angiograms magnetic

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.540 
were done using mr angiograms magnetic
resonance<00:00:55.710> angiograms<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.570> take<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
resonance angiograms that don't take the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.349 
resonance angiograms that don't take the
catheter<00:00:59.550> being<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.270> into<00:01:00.420> an<00:01:00.660> artery<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:02.430> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
catheter being put into an artery the in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.490 
catheter being put into an artery the in
there<00:01:03.750> were<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> couple<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> interesting

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
there were a couple of interesting

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
there were a couple of interesting
things<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.070> were<00:01:05.250> found<00:01:05.460> first<00:01:05.820> there's<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
things that were found first there's a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
things that were found first there's a
lot<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> similarity<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.310> not

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
lot of similarity and that's not

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.429 
lot of similarity and that's not
surprising<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.450> we've<00:01:09.810> known<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> it's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
surprising because we've known that it's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.740 
surprising because we've known that it's
the<00:01:10.619> large<00:01:10.860> vessels<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.729> involved<00:01:12.330> but

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the large vessels that are involved but

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.600 
the large vessels that are involved but
specifically<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.619> study<00:01:14.159> looked<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
specifically this study looked at the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
specifically this study looked at the
patterns<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.420> involvement<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.310> comparing

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
patterns of involvement that comparing

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.870 
patterns of involvement that comparing
if<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.119> subclavian<00:01:19.049> artery<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.460> side<00:01:20.700> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
if the subclavian artery on one side is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060 
if the subclavian artery on one side is
involved<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> other<00:01:22.170> side<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
involved is it on the other side and in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
involved is it on the other side and in
giant<00:01:23.850> cell<00:01:24.060> arteritis<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.200> similar

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
giant cell arteritis it was very similar

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
giant cell arteritis it was very similar
in<00:01:25.890> those<00:01:26.250> arteries<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:26.939> fact<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.420> most

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
in those arteries and in fact for most

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.690 
in those arteries and in fact for most
of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> arteries<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> left

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
of the arteries on the right and left

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850 
of the arteries on the right and left
side<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.240> body<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:31.049> were<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.439> similar

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
side of the body they were very similar

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
side of the body they were very similar
well<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.060> main<00:01:33.450> difference<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
well the main difference was with the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.780 
well the main difference was with the
patients<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> patients<00:01:35.640> with

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
patients are in the patients with

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.600 
patients are in the patients with
takayasu's<00:01:36.570> arteritis<00:01:36.920> where<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
takayasu's arteritis where there was a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.999 
takayasu's arteritis where there was a
definite<00:01:39.119> difference<00:01:39.329> between<00:01:40.110> involvement

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
definite difference between involvement

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.920 
definite difference between involvement
of<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> left<00:01:41.549> subclavian<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> right

of the left subclavian and the right

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.609 
of the left subclavian and the right
subclavian<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:44.790> there<00:01:44.939> was<00:01:45.030> much<00:01:45.270> more

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
subclavian that there was much more

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
subclavian that there was much more
asymmetry<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.770> those<00:01:46.950> patients<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.509> overall

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
asymmetry in those patients but overall

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.420 
asymmetry in those patients but overall
there<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.439> the

there was the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.990 
there was the
many<00:01:51.060> similarities<00:01:51.690> in<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.200> two<00:01:52.350> groups<00:01:53.000> but

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
many similarities in the two groups but

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.050 
many similarities in the two groups but
this<00:01:54.300> study<00:01:54.810> has<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> lot<00:01:55.410> a<00:01:55.710> lot<00:01:56.400> of<00:01:56.490> potential

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
what are called classification criteria

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.480 
what are called classification criteria
for<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> disorders<00:02:09.899> these<00:02:10.649> classification

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
for the disorders these classification

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.520 
for the disorders these classification
criteria<00:02:11.640> were<00:02:12.180> put<00:02:12.450> together<00:02:12.600> for<00:02:13.170> people

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
criteria were put together for people

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.430 
criteria were put together for people
doing<00:02:13.709> studies<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:15.000> try<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.440> differentiate

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
doing studies to try to differentiate

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.420 
doing studies to try to differentiate
one<00:02:17.010> kind<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.459> vasculitis<00:02:18.090> from<00:02:18.510> another<00:02:19.430> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
one kind of vasculitis from another and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.980 
one kind of vasculitis from another and
they<00:02:20.760> weren't<00:02:21.060> used<00:02:21.270> specifically<00:02:21.870> for

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
they weren't used specifically for

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.650 
they weren't used specifically for
diagnosis<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> aims<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.270> future

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
diagnosis one of the aims in the future

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.680 
diagnosis one of the aims in the future
is<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.290> develop<00:02:25.670> diagnostic<00:02:26.670> criteria<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
is to develop diagnostic criteria so

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.400 
is to develop diagnostic criteria so
having<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.440> set<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.650> criteria<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.370> give<00:02:29.790> people

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
having a set of criteria to give people

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.930 
having a set of criteria to give people
fairly<00:02:31.410> good<00:02:31.739> assurance<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.370> they<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.670> make

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
fairly good assurance that they can make

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.000 
fairly good assurance that they can make
a<00:02:32.970> specific<00:02:33.660> diagnosis<00:02:34.440> now<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
a specific diagnosis now one of the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.949 
a specific diagnosis now one of the
questions<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.060> does<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.630> matter

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
questions of this is does it matter

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.870 
questions of this is does it matter
there<00:02:37.230> are<00:02:37.350> these<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.010> same<00:02:38.400> disease

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
there are these really the same disease

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.600 
there are these really the same disease
and<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.230> shows<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.739> or<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.130> looks

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and just that it shows up or it looks

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.610 
and just that it shows up or it looks
different<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.330> younger<00:02:42.720> people<00:02:42.900> than<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.440> does

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
different in younger people than it does

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.370 
different in younger people than it does
in<00:02:43.860> older<00:02:44.340> people<00:02:44.489> who<00:02:44.820> get<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:46.230> we

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
in older people who get it and that we

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.320 
in older people who get it and that we
don't<00:02:46.500> know<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.100> think<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.459> will<00:02:47.670> change

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
don't know but I think it will change

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.190 
don't know but I think it will change
how<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.660> understand<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> disease's<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
how we understand the disease's the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.560 
how we understand the disease's the
giant<00:02:52.200> cell<00:02:52.470> arteritis<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:53.580> has<00:02:53.730> typically

giant cell arteritis that has typically

giant cell arteritis that has typically
been<00:02:54.750> recognized<00:02:55.350> because<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:56.130> its<00:02:56.280> cranial

been recognized because of its cranial
symptoms<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:58.200> know<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.620> there<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:58.920> a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
symptoms and we know that there are a

absent pulse was identified but of forms

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.509 
absent pulse was identified but of forms
of<00:03:37.720> vasculitis<00:03:38.720> giant<00:03:39.650> cell<00:03:39.830> arteritis<00:03:39.860> is

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
of vasculitis giant cell arteritis is

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.910 
of vasculitis giant cell arteritis is
one<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.319> more<00:03:42.319> common<00:03:42.980> forms<00:03:43.659> it<00:03:44.659> has<00:03:44.920> we

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
one of the more common forms it has we

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.069 
one of the more common forms it has we
tend<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.220> see<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> lot<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.209> Minnesota

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
tend to see a lot of it in Minnesota

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.880 
tend to see a lot of it in Minnesota
because<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.709> has<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> higher<00:03:49.310> incidence<00:03:49.760> in

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
because it has a higher incidence in

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.680 
because it has a higher incidence in
people<00:03:51.890> of<00:03:52.010> Northern<00:03:52.459> European<00:03:52.690> extraction

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
people of Northern European extraction

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.619 
people of Northern European extraction
so<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.680> seen<00:03:55.190> in<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.670> Northern<00:03:56.599> Europe

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
so it's seen in in Northern Europe

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.780 
so it's seen in in Northern Europe
that's<00:03:57.200> seen<00:03:57.640> frequently<00:03:58.640> in<00:03:58.849> Minnesotans
