think<00:00:36.440> 60,000<00:00:37.440> BTUs<00:00:37.950> eater<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.000> vent

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
think 60,000 BTUs eater there's a vent

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.840 
think 60,000 BTUs eater there's a vent
right<00:00:39.540> there<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.290> gas<00:00:40.620> line<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.640> goes

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
right there it has a gas line that goes

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.600 
right there it has a gas line that goes
out<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.390> maybe<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:44.430> some

out or maybe it's this way to some
pretty<00:00:44.789> big<00:00:45.000> tanks<00:00:45.390> outside<00:00:45.739> we<00:00:46.739> use<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
pretty big tanks outside we use that to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
pretty big tanks outside we use that to
extend<00:00:47.879> our<00:00:48.120> season<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.629> greenhouse<00:00:48.989> if

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
extend our season in the greenhouse if

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.200 
extend our season in the greenhouse if
we're<00:00:49.379> starting<00:00:49.829> greens<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> push

haven't<00:00:57.239> been<00:00:57.420> using<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.680> behind

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
haven't been using it you can see behind

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
haven't been using it you can see behind
me<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.370> occasionally<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.030> flutter

a<00:01:05.339> vent<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> other<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.630> together<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
a vent on the other all together the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.480 
a vent on the other all together the
greenhouse<00:01:08.630> not<00:01:09.630> drafty<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> side

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
greenhouse not drafty the we have a side

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
greenhouse not drafty the we have a side
that<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.820> fold<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:13.530> lets<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that we fold down and that lets the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
that we fold down and that lets the
birds<00:01:14.100> go<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.060> day<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.720> we

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
birds go in and out all day and then we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.020 
birds go in and out all day and then we
close<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.470> night<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.860> windy

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
close it up at night on windy

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.690 
close it up at night on windy
freezing<00:01:18.840> days<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.350> today<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.950> keep<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
freezing days like today I keep that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
freezing days like today I keep that
side<00:01:21.090> wall<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.900> make<00:01:22.259> sure<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.650> these

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
side wall up and make sure that these

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
side wall up and make sure that these
fans<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.520> turn<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.909> they're<00:01:24.540> triggered<00:01:24.930> by<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
fans can turn on they're triggered by a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.620 
fans can turn on they're triggered by a
thermostat<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> hits<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> have

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
thermostat so if it hits I think I have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.370 
thermostat so if it hits I think I have
it<00:01:27.750> set<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.100> 3540<00:01:29.100> degrees<00:01:29.689> if<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.990> hits<00:01:31.170> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it set to 3540 degrees if it hits that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.810 
it set to 3540 degrees if it hits that
temperature<00:01:31.770> those<00:01:31.979> will<00:01:32.159> turn<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
temperature those will turn on and it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.350 
temperature those will turn on and it
will<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> complete<00:01:33.210> air<00:01:33.659> exchange<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.290> here

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
will do a complete air exchange in here

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.429 
will do a complete air exchange in here
so<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.509> chickens<00:01:36.810> needing<00:01:37.110> heat<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so with chickens needing heat in the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.100 
so with chickens needing heat in the
winter<00:01:37.560> how<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> chicken<00:01:38.640> handles<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.780> winter

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
winter how a chicken handles the winter

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.560 
winter how a chicken handles the winter
is<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> give<00:01:41.520> them<00:01:41.640> fresh<00:01:42.000> water<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
is if you give them fresh water and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.539 
is if you give them fresh water and
plenty<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.020> food<00:01:43.320> they'll<00:01:43.920> eat<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> food

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
plenty of food they'll eat that food

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.210 
plenty of food they'll eat that food
metabolize<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.600> generate<00:01:46.110> heat<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
metabolize it generate heat and if you

don't do any supplemental heat we get a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.070 
don't do any supplemental heat we get a
little<00:02:24.760> bit<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.970> solar<00:02:25.150> heat<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:25.660> even<00:02:25.900> right
