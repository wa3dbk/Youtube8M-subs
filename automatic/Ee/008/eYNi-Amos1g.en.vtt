would your normal hair now for each set
of<00:00:40.260> hair<00:00:40.620> extensions<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.850> eight<00:00:42.090> pieces

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
of hair extensions you get eight pieces

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.729 
of hair extensions you get eight pieces
so<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.879> get<00:00:44.879> four<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.690> smaller<00:00:46.200> whips

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
so you get four of these smaller whips

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.850 
so you get four of these smaller whips
and<00:00:47.329> I'll<00:00:48.329> show<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.110> clip<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.829> back

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and I'll show you the clip on the back

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
and I'll show you the clip on the back
it's<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.940> black<00:00:51.300> clip<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> perfect

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it's a black clip with which is perfect

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
it's a black clip with which is perfect
because<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.610> blends<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.059> well<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
because it blends in well with the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110 
because it blends in well with the
actual<00:00:55.140> black<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.710> day<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.879> hair

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
actual black of day of the hair

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.049 
actual black of day of the hair
extension<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.579> relatively<00:00:59.579> wide

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
extension and it's relatively wide

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.630 
extension and it's relatively wide
actually<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> single<00:01:01.590> clip<00:01:01.920> wefts<00:01:02.340> are

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
actually so the single clip wefts are

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.719 
actually so the single clip wefts are
actually<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.480> inches<00:01:04.140> long<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.100> wide<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
actually two inches long or wide I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.600 
actually two inches long or wide I
should<00:01:06.060> say<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.920> how<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.430> matches

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
should say so you can see how it matches

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.929 
should say so you can see how it matches
up<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> my<00:01:09.600> actual<00:01:09.840> hair<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.400> how<00:01:11.700> much

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
up to my actual hair and that's how much

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.010 
up to my actual hair and that's how much
length<00:01:12.479> you're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
length you're going to get from that and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
length you're going to get from that and
you<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.200> four<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> black

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you get four of these with the black

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
you get four of these with the black
clips<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> you'll<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> stitching<00:01:19.710> on

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
clips and you'll see the stitching on

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.530 
clips and you'll see the stitching on
the<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.520> I'll<00:01:20.670> show<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> stitching

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the back to I'll show you the stitching

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
the back to I'll show you the stitching
it's<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:22.320> secure<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:22.979> really<00:01:23.310> well<00:01:23.580> done

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it's really secure it's really well done

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.609 
it's really secure it's really well done
so<00:01:24.180> these<00:01:24.450> aren't<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> come<00:01:25.110> loose<00:01:25.350> or

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so these aren't going to come loose or

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.399 
so these aren't going to come loose or
anything<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.390> another<00:01:27.390> thing<00:01:27.509> I'll<00:01:27.840> show<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
anything and another thing I'll show you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.819 
anything and another thing I'll show you
is<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.970> hair<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.479> thicker<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> base

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
is that the hair is thicker at the base

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.340 
is that the hair is thicker at the base
and<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> thins<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.780> natural

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and then it thins out as your natural

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.260 
and then it thins out as your natural
hair<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.770> kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> thin<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> comes

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
hair would kind of thin out as it comes

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
hair would kind of thin out as it comes
down<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> end<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.500> thick

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
down to the end so it's not just thick

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.760 
down to the end so it's not just thick
all<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.759> through<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:40.170> thins<00:01:40.500> as

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
all the way through it actually thins as

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.499 
all the way through it actually thins as
it<00:01:40.920> comes<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> end<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.390> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it comes to the end so that kind of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.539 
it comes to the end so that kind of
mimics<00:01:42.840> natural<00:01:43.020> hair<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
mimics natural hair a little bit more to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.109 
mimics natural hair a little bit more to
me<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.360> prefer<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> full

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
me but if you prefer like a full

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.399 
me but if you prefer like a full
extension<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> probably<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
extension this is probably not for you

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.840 
extension this is probably not for you
but<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:50.460> kind<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.500> mesh<00:01:52.500> well<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.829> my<00:01:53.340> own

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
but these kind of mesh well with my own

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.170 
but these kind of mesh well with my own
natural<00:01:54.479> hair<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.320> four<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.829> those

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
natural hair so we get four of those

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.530 
natural hair so we get four of those
then<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.570> get<00:01:58.049> two<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.759> six<00:02:00.180> inch

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
then you also get two of the six inch

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
then you also get two of the six inch
wefts<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.790> there<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.469> six<00:02:04.469> inches<00:02:04.890> wide<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
wefts so there are six inches wide so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.130 
wefts so there are six inches wide so
I'll<00:02:05.579> show<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.880> again<00:02:06.149> compared<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.780> my<00:02:06.899> hair

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
I'll show you again compared to my hair

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
I'll show you again compared to my hair
what<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.580> goes<00:02:08.759> about<00:02:09.060> half

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
what it would be so it goes about half

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.430 
what it would be so it goes about half
way<00:02:09.629> around<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.200> crown<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.009> my<00:02:11.160> head

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
way around the crown of my head

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.620 
way around the crown of my head
so<00:02:12.070> there<00:02:12.430> are<00:02:12.520> three<00:02:12.760> clips<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.480> back<00:02:13.600> of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
so there are three clips on the back of

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.530 
so there are three clips on the back of
this<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:15.960> again<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:18.040> kind<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.550> tapers<00:02:18.880> as<00:02:19.390> it

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
this and again it kind of tapers as it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.300 
this and again it kind of tapers as it
comes<00:02:19.780> down<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.500> things<00:02:20.770> out<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.040> little

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
comes down to and it things out a little

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.400 
comes down to and it things out a little
bit<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:21.850> thicker<00:02:22.060> at<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.780> base<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.290> then

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
bit so it's thicker at the base and then

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.290 
bit so it's thicker at the base and then
it<00:02:23.530> thins<00:02:23.770> out<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:25.180> get<00:02:25.450> two<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.780> those<00:02:26.320> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
it thins out so you get two of those and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.520 
it thins out so you get two of those and
then<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.660> get<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.820> seven<00:02:30.820> inch<00:02:31.090> wide<00:02:31.530> left

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
then you get a seven inch wide left

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.800 
then you get a seven inch wide left
which<00:02:32.980> has<00:02:33.310> four<00:02:33.790> clips<00:02:34.090> which<00:02:34.270> i<00:02:34.420> think<00:02:34.480> is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
which has four clips which i think is

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.540 
which has four clips which i think is
great<00:02:35.020> because<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.620> means<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.340> going<00:02:36.490> to

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
great because this means it's going to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.300 
great because this means it's going to
be<00:02:36.940> more<00:02:37.180> secure<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:38.080> my<00:02:38.200> hair<00:02:38.470> actually<00:02:38.800> have

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
be more secure to my hair actually have

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
be more secure to my hair actually have
other<00:02:39.520> hair<00:02:39.850> extensions<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:41.250> septum

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
other hair extensions and this septum

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.170 
other hair extensions and this septum
7inch<00:02:43.900> wife<00:02:44.200> would<00:02:44.440> only<00:02:44.650> be<00:02:45.040> three<00:02:45.550> Clips<00:02:45.850> so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
7inch wife would only be three Clips so

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.050 
7inch wife would only be three Clips so
I<00:02:46.390> love<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.140> has<00:02:47.410> four<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.100> then<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
I love that this has four and then the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.470 
I love that this has four and then the
last<00:02:49.240> weft<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:50.290> 8<00:02:50.890> inch<00:02:51.400> wide<00:02:51.850> wefts<00:02:52.270> which

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
they're really soft they're really easy

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.760 
they're really soft they're really easy
to<00:03:23.560> use<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:24.400> clips<00:03:24.730> are<00:03:24.940> actually<00:03:25.770> really

easy<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:29.200> snap<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.709> they're<00:03:30.070> not<00:03:30.280> as<00:03:30.520> tight<00:03:31.180> as

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
easy to snap in they're not as tight as

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.570 
easy to snap in they're not as tight as
the<00:03:31.630> other<00:03:31.750> ones<00:03:31.989> i<00:03:32.140> have<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.709> they're<00:03:33.370> really

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
the other ones i have so they're really

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.790 
the other ones i have so they're really
kind<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.300> soft<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.050> can<00:03:35.230> imagine<00:03:35.440> that

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
kind of soft is you can imagine that

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.070 
kind of soft is you can imagine that
they're<00:03:36.010> kind<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.310> softer<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.030> don't<00:03:37.600> hurt<00:03:37.870> my

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
they're kind of softer and don't hurt my

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.960 
they're kind of softer and don't hurt my
head<00:03:38.350> as<00:03:38.530> much<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:38.980> like<00:03:39.370> these<00:03:39.610> clippings

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
head as much so I like these clippings

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.750 
head as much so I like these clippings
and<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.900> also<00:03:41.110> like<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.560> fact<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:42.040> they<00:03:42.310> taper

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
and I also like the fact that they taper

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.390 
and I also like the fact that they taper
out<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.810> blends<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.410> more<00:03:44.650> naturally<00:03:45.190> with

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
out so it blends in more naturally with

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.449 
out so it blends in more naturally with
my<00:03:45.610> natural<00:03:46.180> hair<00:03:46.830> other<00:03:47.830> people<00:03:48.160> might<00:03:48.280> not

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
my natural hair other people might not

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.850 
my natural hair other people might not
like<00:03:48.519> that<00:03:48.910> they<00:03:49.090> may<00:03:49.330> need<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.930> me<00:03:50.140> like<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.380> full

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
like that they may need a me like a full

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.060 
like that they may need a me like a full
length<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:53.019> hair<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.470> density<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
length of the hair the density of the

lift them up and see it but it blends in

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.360

really<00:05:48.510> well<00:05:48.840> with<00:05:49.080> my<00:05:49.470> hair<00:05:49.740> because<00:05:49.920> my<00:05:50.130> hair

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
really well with my hair because my hair

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.790 
really well with my hair because my hair
is<00:05:50.400> black<00:05:50.910> in<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.240> extensions<00:05:51.840> are<00:05:52.080> black<00:05:52.530> and

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.020 
is black in the extensions are black and
I'll<00:05:53.400> show<00:05:53.640> you<00:05:53.670> how<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.090> length<00:05:54.540> looks<00:05:56.030> from

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
I'll show you how the length looks from

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.530 
I'll show you how the length looks from
the<00:05:57.240> back<00:05:57.800> so<00:05:58.800> that's<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.580> length<00:05:59.790> it<00:06:00.120> gets

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
the back so that's the length it gets

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.260 
the back so that's the length it gets
down<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:02.450> just<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.660> tip<00:06:04.200> of<00:06:04.470> my<00:06:04.940> lower<00:06:05.940> back

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
down to just the tip of my lower back

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.930 
down to just the tip of my lower back
and<00:06:07.550> that's<00:06:08.550> how<00:06:08.850> they<00:06:09.180> look<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:10.610> as<00:06:11.610> you<00:06:11.760> can

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
and that's how they look and as you can

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.620 
and that's how they look and as you can
see<00:06:11.970> they<00:06:12.360> blend<00:06:12.780> in<00:06:13.020> pretty<00:06:13.260> well<00:06:14.270> you<00:06:15.270> can<00:06:15.450> go

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
see they blend in pretty well you can go

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.390 
see they blend in pretty well you can go
ahead<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:15.960> stall<00:06:16.500> them<00:06:16.530> how<00:06:16.890> you<00:06:16.920> wish<00:06:17.250> you

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
ahead and stall them how you wish you

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.910 
ahead and stall them how you wish you
can<00:06:17.610> use<00:06:17.850> them<00:06:18.090> straight<00:06:18.540> where<00:06:19.170> you<00:06:19.350> can<00:06:19.560> curl

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
can use them straight where you can curl

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.400 
can use them straight where you can curl
them<00:06:20.220> just<00:06:21.060> whatever<00:06:21.450> hairstyle<00:06:22.230> you're

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
them just whatever hairstyle you're

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.670 
them just whatever hairstyle you're
going<00:06:22.770> for<00:06:23.360> so<00:06:24.360> that's<00:06:24.630> how<00:06:24.780> they<00:06:25.020> look<00:06:25.290> in<00:06:25.440> my

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
going for so that's how they look in my

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.870 
going for so that's how they look in my
hair<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.660> they<00:06:27.660> reach<00:06:27.900> just<00:06:28.380> below<00:06:28.890> the<00:06:29.490> my

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
hair and they reach just below the my

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.420 
hair and they reach just below the my
bra<00:06:30.180> so<00:06:30.720> my<00:06:30.930> bra<00:06:31.260> length<00:06:31.590> right<00:06:31.830> there<00:06:32.160> that's

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
bra so my bra length right there that's

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.420 
bra so my bra length right there that's
where<00:06:32.700> they<00:06:32.850> get<00:06:33.060> to<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.630> I<00:06:34.380> think<00:06:34.680> they<00:06:34.830> blend

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
where they get to and I think they blend

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.390 
where they get to and I think they blend
in<00:06:35.490> pretty<00:06:35.820> well<00:06:36.060> since<00:06:36.930> my<00:06:37.050> hair<00:06:37.290> is<00:06:37.500> not<00:06:37.860> as

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
in pretty well since my hair is not as

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.070 
in pretty well since my hair is not as
long<00:06:39.300> as<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:40.100> extensions<00:06:41.100> it<00:06:41.460> needs<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.930> be

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
long as the extensions it needs to be

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.930 
long as the extensions it needs to be
blended<00:06:43.680> in<00:06:43.830> and<00:06:44.040> I<00:06:44.130> think<00:06:44.370> it<00:06:44.520> blends<00:06:44.760> in

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
blended in and I think it blends in

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.420 
blended in and I think it blends in
pretty<00:06:45.180> well<00:06:45.480> so<00:06:45.950> let<00:06:46.950> me<00:06:47.100> know<00:06:47.190> what<00:06:47.220> you
