 that maybe in the clear soup there is 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.740
 yes, often the most diverse deposits 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.490
 Among other things, a stitch and 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.040
 things and good too 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.670
 vegan copying and we need it 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.140
 first a vegetable soup for the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.000
 You can actually take vegetable soup 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.300
 what you want I have here now three 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.019
 six potatoes onions small 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.390
 piece of harmful then looked a half 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.050
 leek and a full two hands 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.120
 live green and you can 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.399
 Actually, they vary as you would like 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.630
 can all of them still clean and 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.910
 paprika or raps my thing also yes what 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.379
 is and likes to have vegetables so this is 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:09.850
 First of all, cut small and in 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:11.560
 as small as possible dice so the beans 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.050
 I have now in the little piece 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.410
 cut and just stop the run in 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.970
 fine stripes and while curbing too 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.459
 into small cubes but I 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.440
 first done in an excel bowl 

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.910
 because the same protection as the first one 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.410
 become 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.810
 for lying a bit in a bit 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.220
 give bigger pot 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 wet the onion and then glassy 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.250
 sweat 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 to become brown then you can a new one 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.649
 remaining profits to live up to that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:56.890
 blow once and after about one music 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:00.250
 and it's all in the water 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.720
 the vegetables are well covered when you are 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.549
 then give dry herbs 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.940
 best now I have relate 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.860
 tablespoon rosemary and you can 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.830
 ever a tablespoon of vegetables per year 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.660
 then turn the pot on little heat 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.300
 put 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.980
 cover it and the whole thing now 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.050
 about half an hour to go 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 let it simmer on the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.000
 Once it's true, I'm doing one myself 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.280
 Mixture of three tablespoons since one 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.640
 fix a tablespoon of bean or soy flour 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.739
 a teaspoon of vegetable stock and I do 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.540
 it still small teaspoon paprika preserve 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.310
 that does not look quite good in the end 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.750
 look like a sting if you like it 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.000
 really it is too similar 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.660
 looks then just give about 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.890
 Keep that teaspoon of turmeric 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.110
 can you ever roar down or 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.829
 has arrived and now careful 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:03:01.780
 shared water add here is the 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:04.239
 right consistency then have the dough 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.859
 shallow with your hand or hers 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.280
 You can also use a rolling pin to help 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:12.459
 takes so and the dough today you so long 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 from so far you have about one flattens 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.030
 sugar in half an inch thick 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.840
 then you need a flat certain 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.880
 flag and a small piece of olive oil like that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.769
 Our soon to be hot you can yours 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.769
 simply put dough patties in your hands 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:43.960
 and then from both sides nice brown 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:46.570
 sautÃ© as well as the patties then enough 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.090
 has taken color then could it now 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.460
 Just take it out of the game and you know 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.150
 lie on a chopping board and 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.400
 He can cool down for a while 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.970
 new pages then briefly cooled 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.920
 then he could handle a big knife 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.770
 nice cubes do not cut from it 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.060
 Great for those who are cooking in the 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.120
 soup in any case a bit 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.650
 the real one actually becomes yes 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.600
 not always so good 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.000
 cooked but with extra happens so too 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.220
 say that it is the vegan variant 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.220
 differently here the side really has one 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.860
 Well, cook with it, yes, yes 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.530
 so a bit agitated and also 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:40.720
 about then the consistency gets and 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.180
 The entry should be done now 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.990
 about ten to fifteen minutes on less 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.090
 cooking is the vegetable soup 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.250
 in the reason already finished you can 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.080

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.749
 I do not have to 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.669
 but as I said why more so similar 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:18.639
 then want to have a bit of turmeric 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.539
 Spice and best not completely 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.800
 in brown while frying and 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.340
 then you could do that 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.340
 confound 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.490
