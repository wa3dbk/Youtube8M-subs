guesstimate your distance
anything<00:01:59.219> good<00:01:59.310> thing<00:01:59.520> about<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.329> not

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
anything good thing about this I'm not

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.020 
anything good thing about this I'm not
sure<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> feature<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> 166<00:02:02.369> but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
sure this is a feature on the 166 but

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520 
sure this is a feature on the 166 but
there<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.270> another<00:02:03.479> magnifying<00:02:04.079> glass<00:02:04.320> which

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
there is another magnifying glass which

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.649 
there is another magnifying glass which
if<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.640> show<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.880> there

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
if I can get out I can show you there

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.979 
if I can get out I can show you there
she<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.459> the<00:02:08.459> magnifying<00:02:08.910> glass<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
she is the magnifying glass there so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.000 
she is the magnifying glass there so
that<00:02:10.140> magnifies<00:02:10.739> your<00:02:10.770> own

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
that magnifies your own

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.589 
that magnifies your own
focus<00:02:13.010> points<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.940> be<00:02:14.090> extremely

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
focus points so you can be extremely

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.619 
focus points so you can be extremely
accurate<00:02:14.810> with<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.250> that's<00:02:16.250> let's<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.299> fold

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
accurate with it that's let's just fold

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.860 
accurate with it that's let's just fold
that<00:02:17.720> down<00:02:18.700> CS<00:02:19.700> twin-lens<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.569> bottom

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
that down CS twin-lens so the bottom

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.220 
that down CS twin-lens so the bottom
lens<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.319> your<00:02:22.360> bit<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.480> exposes<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.019> film

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
lens is your bit that exposes the film

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.890 
lens is your bit that exposes the film
it<00:02:24.739> takes<00:02:24.920> medium<00:02:25.280> format<00:02:25.549> a<00:02:25.909> little<00:02:25.970> too<00:02:26.569> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
it takes medium format a little too and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.530 
it takes medium format a little too and
you<00:02:27.470> can<00:02:27.560> see<00:02:27.739> how<00:02:27.890> many<00:02:28.099> frames<00:02:29.030> you've<00:02:29.299> used

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
you can see how many frames you've used

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.420 
you can see how many frames you've used
through<00:02:30.079> the<00:02:30.140> local<00:02:30.290> read<00:02:30.440> window<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.190> that's

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
through the local read window and that's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.229 
through the local read window and that's
your<00:02:31.610> winding<00:02:32.569> on<00:02:32.720> knob<00:02:32.930> which<00:02:33.290> pours<00:02:33.950> out<00:02:34.239> to

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
your winding on knob which pours out to

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.270

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.490 
this ball in when you finish the film
also<00:02:40.849> on<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.000> back<00:02:41.180> at<00:02:41.569> least<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:42.019> know<00:02:42.049> things

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
also on the back at least to know things

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.849 
also on the back at least to know things
here<00:02:42.799> then<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.549> pages<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:45.500> then<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.709> back

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
here then the pages and then the back

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.270 
here then the pages and then the back
pops<00:02:46.400> down<00:02:46.609> so<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.359> put<00:02:47.480> your<00:02:47.510> filming<00:02:48.280> so

pops down so you can put your filming so
well<00:02:50.239> how<00:02:50.420> do<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.750> set<00:02:51.220> stuff<00:02:52.660> listen<00:02:53.660> Emma's

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
well how do you set stuff listen Emma's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.559 
well how do you set stuff listen Emma's
here<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.500> lens<00:02:54.739> are<00:02:55.069> your<00:02:55.519> own<00:02:55.760> shutter

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
here on the lens are your own shutter

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.930 
here on the lens are your own shutter
speed<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:56.989> aperture<00:02:57.200> values<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.609> the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
speed and aperture values and so the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.110 
speed and aperture values and so the
shutter<00:02:59.180> speed<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.659> the<00:02:59.780> top<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.760> ranges

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
shutter speed is on the top so it ranges

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.410 
shutter speed is on the top so it ranges
from<00:03:02.180> bulb<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:03.530> well<00:03:03.859> 1<00:03:04.489> over<00:03:04.519> 20<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.690> 50<00:03:06.200> and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
from bulb to well 1 over 20 to 50 and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.819 
from bulb to well 1 over 20 to 50 and
there's<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> little<00:03:08.659> red<00:03:08.840> marker<00:03:09.379> on<00:03:09.560> there

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
there's a little red marker on there

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.880 
there's a little red marker on there
which<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:09.950> can<00:03:10.129> see<00:03:10.310> which<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.879> not<00:03:11.890> moving

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
which you can see which is not moving

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.080 
which you can see which is not moving
yet<00:03:13.129> because<00:03:13.370> I've<00:03:13.459> turned<00:03:13.579> along<00:03:13.849> there<00:03:14.000> it

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
yet because I've turned along there it

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.309 
yet because I've turned along there it
is<00:03:14.209> there<00:03:14.810> we<00:03:14.959> go

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
is there we go

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.170 
is there we go
that<00:03:15.590> one<00:03:15.739> there<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.190> that's<00:03:16.910> used<00:03:17.120> by

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
that one there and that's used by

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.610 
that one there and that's used by
turning<00:03:17.630> this<00:03:17.750> little<00:03:17.989> knob<00:03:18.169> here

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
turning this little knob here

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.740 
turning this little knob here
so<00:03:19.099> she's<00:03:19.340> shutter<00:03:19.549> speed<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.269> I'll<00:03:20.480> change

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
so she's shutter speed and I'll change

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.589 
so she's shutter speed and I'll change
that<00:03:21.340> your<00:03:22.340> aperture<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.760> just<00:03:23.000> below<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.299> and

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
that your aperture is just below it and

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.140 
that your aperture is just below it and
you<00:03:23.750> can<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:24.290> it'll<00:03:24.880> point<00:03:25.880> her

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
you can see that it'll point her

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.839 
you can see that it'll point her
somewhere<00:03:26.810> there<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.560> at<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.739> end<00:03:27.919> you<00:03:28.700> can

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
somewhere there it is at the end you can

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.250 
somewhere there it is at the end you can
see<00:03:28.879> that<00:03:29.329> moving<00:03:29.569> and<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.260> changed

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
see that moving and and that is changed

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.900 
see that moving and and that is changed
by<00:03:33.440> using<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.799> little<00:03:34.010> one<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.280> Indonesia
