wise you also got the you've got the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.730 
wise you also got the you've got the
tilly<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:03.479> assess<00:02:04.479> which<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.110> think<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.530> it's

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
tilly to assess which I think that it's

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.400 
tilly to assess which I think that it's
the<00:02:05.979> lightest<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:07.090> sort<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.570> deterioration

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
the lightest that sort of deterioration

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.220 
the lightest that sort of deterioration
that's<00:02:09.100> right<00:02:09.280> yeah<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.580> lightest<00:02:10.230> that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
that's right yeah the lightest that

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.020 
that's right yeah the lightest that
engine<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.890> conjunction<00:02:12.430> with<00:02:12.580> the
