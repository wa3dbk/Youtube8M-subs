engraving on the blade it says
counterpoint<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.820> says<00:02:04.030> coal<00:02:04.540> steel

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:19.380 

somewhere<00:02:17.280> okay<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.370> says<00:02:18.520> coal<00:02:18.850> steel<00:02:19.180> on<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
somewhere okay it says coal steel on the

somewhere okay it says coal steel on the
other<00:02:19.630> side<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:22.090> swedge<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.750> thing

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
other side and the swedge on this thing

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.500 
other side and the swedge on this thing
is<00:02:23.050> not<00:02:23.260> sharp<00:02:23.790> because<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.030> close<00:02:25.270> it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510

that thing would be you could cut

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.650 
that thing would be you could cut
yourself<00:02:28.720> on<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.470> not<00:02:29.650> sharp
