00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:02.700
 This is not the price 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.940
 which comes then as alone in the TopTen can also cost the it 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 because it is also quite good if you offer such a cooked 7 Dietrich 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.189
 and a bit surreal too 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.189
 the humans had 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.929
 The state was different 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.739
 I lead I take mine because the top unfortunately is every ski boot 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.769
 Topic a bit 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.140
 in terms of development 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.800
 what comes after that is more common 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.980
 the sec suit you can not see the best yet 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 Schnati main-spessart 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.110
 Here are the first nuclei 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.510
 the little ones are very strong because you have to be careful 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.780
 but if you have the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.800
 You can get the trailing edge around the bandages quickly from the cores 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.080
 Milk not so hot 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.990
 but be careful it is still sharp 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.320
 alternative 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.740
 is there such a thing here? 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 dried Schillig returns 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.280
 so you can have a few of me and then the whole thing will be funny 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.520
 Not for the recipe with the gala dinner 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.490
 then I will do otherwise then 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.430
 and a few insights 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.270
 at Florida's ball 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.680
 Belek say I believe that 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.760
 that makes Gundula Schaaf, I would have been great as well so something crew 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.390
 One should still do in the house but I know and has proven 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 Schiphol was considered 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640
 or has been sent 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.700
 I do not even think there is any worse case makes us strong 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.939
 no contract also nice depending on what you want 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.800
 he saws you are spoiled for choice 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.240
 I have everyone 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.710
 and just needs 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.610
 always something different especially to go to a cook series 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 but it will take even longer 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.520
 So as you said only cooks 15 minutes so the taste 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.910
 are right through 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.910
 we can also pass on the pool a bit more 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.370
 At least thinks to top it off 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.180
 which side it is I can pull Cyfrowy Polsat 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.299
 not we do not see tradable 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.339
 it pays for that should be wonderful 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.079
 He can do his duties 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.470
 September started 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.280
 and also damage in the hands 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.589
 Curry sauce KÃ¶tter Melange 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.589
 With the colorful cities markets I love Werkself all over 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.620
 Dangling from the ceiling Soldiers could not get infected 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.549
 smells great 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.549
 almost has 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.779
 Let's take a look for the moment 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:20.279
 yes, a little something was left in there Kurt 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.419
 later rises after a weak start to look into the pots 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.119
 The beginning is not just resting 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.279
 7 but 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.270
 every ingredient of each piece is different 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.580
 and that's why I want to respond individually and then have to 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.829
 react spontaneously 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.290
 The Stanser also offered it to me one day after the fact 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.810
 the whole time 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.439
 and looks very good 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.769
 It's also a bit to share with him 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.889
 In the beginning I have five things in the coming year 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.809
 Minute circled the ball will be missed 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.470
 make our client unique creations 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.370
 and that's why I can unfortunately be so bad for some of you 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.279
 pure what was distributed so far 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:02.990
 044 has grown from the whole field vegetables now about 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.299
 they have to cook for ten minutes 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.389
 and now I just always try 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.389
 has been added 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 did not think to be too hot 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.590
 and finally the next few days do not offer now has then laughing 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.919
 num so can 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:29.800
 in full day 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 he could do the paper 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.029
 / Municipality responsible 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:42.539
 Bruns 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.969
 a little bit of lemon juice through donations 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.430
 Schreier the whole is then always 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.430
 the right cookies 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.139
 fresh lemon juice from beer chips funny 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.219
 I like it very much 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.110
 important thing is to still buy my action 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.689
 the visual center itself 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.240
 you can get impressions into the skin cells very badly 

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:06.490
 Lemon juice out according to experience 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.320
 So now he says in Curry it's important to add lemon juice first 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.870
 when the dish is finished cooking as 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.900
 so that gives the freshness 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.810
 because if bone percent then I always fall for my experience 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.430
 that's why cooking is not cooking anymore 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.009
 now he can emphasize 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.009
 that is 600 orphans and that's what it's all about 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.719
 over the served 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.559
 professionals 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.719
 we bring you the learning space 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.270
 that's so out of the pot 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.189
 Woman out 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.249
 you can not do that well with FDP 15 degrees 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.520
 that's for the taste of cooking with you 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.690
 Basically, this one is not maintained this year 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.539
 this tasted the Gefen 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.919
 should not do more now and wishes express a good 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.919
 appetite 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.389
 Where
