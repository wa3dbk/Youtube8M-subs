and<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.560> should<00:02:38.080> there<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.170> go<00:02:39.320> it's<00:02:39.890> right

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
and it should there you go it's right

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.990 
and it should there you go it's right
now<00:02:40.520> entering<00:02:41.000> trickle<00:02:41.540> charge<00:02:42.820> which<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:43.970> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
now entering trickle charge which is a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.760 
now entering trickle charge which is a
slower<00:02:44.270> charge<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:44.960> slowly<00:02:45.380> just

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
slower charge so it's slowly just

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.570 
slower charge so it's slowly just
charging<00:02:46.280> my<00:02:46.400> battery<00:02:46.430> now<00:02:46.910> not<00:02:47.300> like<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.320> was

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
charging my battery now not like it was

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.100 
charging my battery now not like it was
it<00:02:49.580> was<00:02:49.820> charging<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.330> really<00:02:50.540> fast<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.960> while

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
it was charging it really fast a while

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.830 
it was charging it really fast a while
ago<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:51.820> now<00:02:52.820> it's<00:02:53.030> just<00:02:53.090> doing<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.570> slowly

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
ago but now it's just doing it slowly

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.540 
ago but now it's just doing it slowly
like<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.080> little<00:02:54.350> wall<00:02:54.620> trickle<00:02:55.070> charger<00:02:55.400> that

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
like a little wall trickle charger that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.490 
like a little wall trickle charger that
you<00:02:55.640> can<00:02:55.730> just<00:02:55.850> put<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.090> off<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:57.050> if<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.290> take<00:02:57.440> it

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
you can just put it off and if I take it

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.250 
you can just put it off and if I take it
off<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:00.560> turned<00:03:00.830> off<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.960> mean<00:03:02.960> if<00:03:03.110> you're

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
off and just turned off I mean if you're

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.780 
off and just turned off I mean if you're
gonna<00:03:03.410> charge<00:03:03.770> your<00:03:03.950> battery<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> suggest<00:03:04.700> you

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
gonna charge your battery I suggest you

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.650 
gonna charge your battery I suggest you
actually<00:03:04.940> use<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:06.070> connected<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.220> wall

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
actually use this connected to a wall

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.710 
actually use this connected to a wall
plug<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.840> in<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.350> then<00:03:09.650> let<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.160> charge<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:11.540> if

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
plug it in and then let it charge but if

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.210 
plug it in and then let it charge but if
you're<00:03:11.900> probably<00:03:12.080> in<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.320> car<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.100> got

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
you're probably in the car and you got

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.790 
you're probably in the car and you got
to<00:03:13.400> charge<00:03:13.610> your<00:03:13.760> batteries<00:03:14.590> that'd<00:03:15.590> be<00:03:15.770> a

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
to charge your batteries that'd be a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.930 
to charge your batteries that'd be a
pretty<00:03:16.010> smart<00:03:16.280> idea<00:03:17.860> um<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:18.950> bought<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.700> set

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
pretty smart idea um I bought the set

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.510 
pretty smart idea um I bought the set

batteries with the Tamiya connectors you

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.170 
batteries with the Tamiya connectors you
can<00:03:52.250> separately<00:03:53.180> buy<00:03:54.520> large<00:03:55.520> type<00:03:55.880> because

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
can separately buy large type because

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.930 
can separately buy large type because
this<00:03:56.360> is<00:03:56.510> what<00:03:56.690> comes<00:03:56.840> with<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.260> large<00:03:57.530> type<00:03:57.940> to

Dean's - I forgot the other names
there's<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.290> bunch<00:04:03.770> of<00:04:03.980> them<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:06.380> could

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
there's a bunch of them you could

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.530 
there's a bunch of them you could
connect<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.100> Dean's<00:04:10.360> knees<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:14.390> could

connect it to Dean's knees and you could

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.520 
connect it to Dean's knees and you could

think that's what they're called yeah
I'm<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.720> really<00:04:23.780> that's<00:04:24.229> what<00:04:24.350> they<00:04:24.470> call<00:04:24.680> which

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
I'm I really that's what they call which

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.219 
I'm I really that's what they call which
is<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.039> smaller<00:04:25.400> seven

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
is a smaller seven

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.629 
is a smaller seven
7.2<00:04:28.229> volt<00:04:28.470> batteries<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.919> if<00:04:31.919> you're<00:04:32.340> still

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
7.2 volt batteries so if you're still

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.600 
7.2 volt batteries so if you're still
using<00:04:32.699> a<00:04:33.389> wall<00:04:34.080> charger<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.830> wall<00:04:35.220> trickle

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
using a wall charger like a wall trickle

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.390 
using a wall charger like a wall trickle
charger<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.680> you're<00:04:37.680> actually<00:04:38.099> using<00:04:38.190> a

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
charger and you're actually using a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.219 
charger and you're actually using a
high-end<00:04:40.490> airsoft<00:04:41.490> gun<00:04:41.729> airsoft<00:04:42.629> battery<00:04:42.960> I

high-end airsoft gun airsoft battery I

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.390 
high-end airsoft gun airsoft battery I
would<00:04:44.099> suggest<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.669> switch<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.449> one<00:04:45.569> of<00:04:45.690> these

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
would suggest you switch to one of these

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.460 
would suggest you switch to one of these
or<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.970> itself<00:04:48.569> because<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.259> actually

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
or this itself because this is actually

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.670 
or this itself because this is actually
a<00:04:49.770> great<00:04:50.069> charger<00:04:50.520> charges<00:04:51.120> it's<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.110> plan<00:04:52.409> for

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
a great charger charges it's a plan for

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.689 
a great charger charges it's a plan for
vaults<00:04:53.069> in<00:04:53.750> 40<00:04:54.750> minutes<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.379> think<00:04:55.680> if<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.550> want

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
vaults in 40 minutes I think if you want

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.129 
vaults in 40 minutes I think if you want
to<00:04:56.759> go<00:04:56.849> up<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.150> could<00:04:57.300> buy<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.449> more<00:04:58.080> expensive

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
to go up you could buy a more expensive

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.189 
to go up you could buy a more expensive
one<00:04:58.800> which<00:04:59.009> will<00:04:59.130> probably<00:04:59.280> be<00:04:59.460> like<00:04:59.699> 50<00:05:00.199> and

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
one which will probably be like 50 and

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.809 
one which will probably be like 50 and
it'll<00:05:01.889> charge<00:05:02.039> it<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.400> 30<00:05:03.030> or<00:05:03.659> 20<00:05:04.550> but<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.610> mean

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
it'll charge it in 30 or 20 but I mean

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.649 
it'll charge it in 30 or 20 but I mean
if<00:05:06.060> you<00:05:06.210> don't<00:05:06.300> want<00:05:06.509> to<00:05:07.580> use<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:09.150> much<00:05:09.389> money

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
if you don't want to use that much money

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.010 
if you don't want to use that much money
you<00:05:10.470> could<00:05:10.590> just<00:05:10.770> get<00:05:10.889> this<00:05:11.130> which<00:05:11.550> is

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
you could just get this which is
