app is interesting card and it's like

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.540 
app is interesting card and it's like
very<00:00:25.080> similar<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> seven<00:00:25.859> tools<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.189> Bandit

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550

very similar to seven tools the Bandit
and<00:00:26.699> very<00:00:27.269> similar<00:00:27.660> application<00:00:28.349> however

and very similar application however
very<00:00:28.980> different<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> actual<00:00:30.119> Ferriero<00:00:30.510> if

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
very different in the actual Ferriero if

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
very different in the actual Ferriero if
we<00:00:31.529> apply<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.160> sense<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> wiretap

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
we apply it in that sense and wiretap

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
we apply it in that sense and wiretap
obviously<00:00:34.110> I've<00:00:34.200> got<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> German<00:00:34.860> card<00:00:35.520> here

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790

obviously I've got a German card here
obviously<00:00:36.000> I've<00:00:36.300> got<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.020> definition<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
obviously I've got the the definition of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
obviously I've got the the definition of
the<00:00:37.649> card<00:00:37.860> itself<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.670> why<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the card itself so why is that when a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.060 
the card itself so why is that when a
trap<00:00:39.690> card<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> activated<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.829> gate<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
trap card is activated and gate the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.860 
trap card is activated and gate the
activation<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.300> shuffle<00:00:42.750> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
activation and if you do shuffle that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
activation and if you do shuffle that
card<00:00:43.110> into<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.559> deck<00:00:43.950> okay<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.940> does

seven tools are going to do I can't
quite<00:00:46.379> remember<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.920> yeah<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.579> the

quite remember that one yeah when the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.040 
quite remember that one yeah when the
chapel<00:00:47.850> card<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.120> activated<00:00:48.210> pay<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> thousand

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
chapel card is activated pay a thousand

Life<00:00:49.079> Points<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.559> get<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> activation<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> if

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Life Points to get the activation and if

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.240 
Life Points to get the activation and if
you<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.850> destroy<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.829> similar

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you do destroy it right so very similar

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
application although obviously they have

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.049 
application although obviously they have
a<00:00:54.840> major<00:00:55.350> difference<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.340> people<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.879> oh

car<00:00:59.039> doesn't<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.579> mad<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.910> me<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.120> going

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
car doesn't really mad at me it's going

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.150 
car doesn't really mad at me it's going
to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> super<00:01:00.780> rare<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> set<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to be a super rare in the set so it's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.470 
to be a super rare in the set so it's
not<00:01:02.309> really<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.670> hard<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.120> hold<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
not really that hard to get hold of a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
not really that hard to get hold of a
wiretap<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:04.920> big<00:01:05.220> deal

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
wiretap so it's not really big deal

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
wiretap so it's not really big deal
however<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
however actually if you think about it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.620 
however actually if you think about it
in<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.830> Furio<00:01:08.220> since<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> cards<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.270> very

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
in more Furio since the cards are very

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
in more Furio since the cards are very
different<00:01:09.869> seven<00:01:10.590> Sol's<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> Bandit<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
different seven Sol's the Bandit you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.830 
different seven Sol's the Bandit you
know<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.909> paying<00:01:12.119> nine<00:01:12.360> points<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
know you are paying nine points and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
obviously we're going into a format now

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.560 
obviously we're going into a format now

consider it that there's a possibility
that<00:01:30.780> gig<00:01:31.110> ears<00:01:31.409> might<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.829> playing<00:01:32.040> white<00:01:32.340> app

instead of seven tools the band it just

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.600 
instead of seven tools the band it just
so<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> resolve<00:01:35.159> their<00:01:35.400> sole

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
points in the bank so that they can get

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819

some<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.509> monsters<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> probably<00:01:40.470> create<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
some more monsters and probably create a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.420 
some more monsters and probably create a
more<00:01:40.979> formidable<00:01:41.280> field<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.860> does<00:01:43.860> wiretap

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
more formidable field but does wiretap

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.889 
more formidable field but does wiretap
is<00:01:44.640> why<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> had<00:01:45.060> better<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.659> just

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is why it's had better in that just

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:46.969 
is why it's had better in that just
because<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> fact<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> didn't<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
because the fact that you didn't have to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
because the fact that you didn't have to
pay<00:01:47.100> any<00:01:47.130> Life<00:01:47.430> Points<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.090> answer<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
pay any Life Points the answer really is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
pay any Life Points the answer really is
no<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.530> mean<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.460> better<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:50.970> worse<00:01:51.180> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
no I mean it's not better or worse I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.670 
no I mean it's not better or worse I
mean<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.750> different<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> depends<00:01:52.560> exactly

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
mean it's different it depends exactly

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.139 
mean it's different it depends exactly
what<00:01:53.040> we're<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.700> thousand

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
field again so putting a monster back

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.360 
field again so putting a monster back
into<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> deck<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.620> very<00:02:22.860> very<00:02:23.160> good

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
into the deck it's very very good

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.620 
into the deck it's very very good
because<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.850> means<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.030> they<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.390> draw

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
because it means that they have to draw

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.150 
because it means that they have to draw
it<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.530> means<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.890> they're<00:02:26.040> not

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
it back and it means that they're not

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.380 
it back and it means that they're not
going<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.490> drawing<00:02:26.670> something<00:02:27.090> else

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
going to be drawing something else

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.900 
going to be drawing something else
realistically<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:29.220> can't<00:02:29.430> compare<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.820> to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
realistically you can't compare it to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.580 
realistically you can't compare it to
something<00:02:30.120> else<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.720> bounces<00:02:31.140> light<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
something else that bounces light to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.830 
something else that bounces light to
dori<00:02:31.800> because<00:02:32.460> actually<00:02:32.970> trap<00:02:33.240> cards<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
dori because actually trap cards do you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.790 
dori because actually trap cards do you
know<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.080> kind<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.260> go<00:02:34.380> into<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> graveyard

information I mean if you negate the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.960 
information I mean if you negate the
second<00:02:49.230> mirror<00:02:49.500> force<00:02:49.800> for<00:02:50.070> example<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.670> then

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
second mirror force for example and then

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.400 
second mirror force for example and then
you<00:02:51.090> find<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.510> opponent's<00:02:51.870> graveyard<00:02:51.989> to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
you find your opponent's graveyard to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.050 
you find your opponent's graveyard to
check<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.770> see<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.160> otk<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> go

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
check to see if your otk is going to go

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.310 
check to see if your otk is going to go
through<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.450> then<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.900> see<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.200> they've

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
through and then you see that they've

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.440 
through and then you see that they've
got<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.620> mirror<00:02:55.830> force<00:02:56.130> then<00:02:56.700> you're<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.180> all

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
got to mirror force then you're like all

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.640 
got to mirror force then you're like all
good<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.900> means<00:02:57.989> they're<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
good that means they're not going to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.050 
good that means they're not going to
really<00:02:58.770> stop<00:02:59.040> me<00:02:59.160> they<00:02:59.250> might<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.489> D<00:02:59.670> prism

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
really stop me they might have D prism

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.580 
really stop me they might have D prism
but<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.540> honest<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.930> mean<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.290> know<00:03:01.440> that

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
but to be honest I mean if you know that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.470 
but to be honest I mean if you know that
my<00:03:01.800> ad<00:03:02.010> prison<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.120> go<00:03:03.239> straight

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
my ad prison then you can go straight

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.699 
my ad prison then you can go straight
ahead<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.110> you've<00:03:04.260> got<00:03:04.440> like<00:03:04.590> you

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
ahead you know or you've got like you

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.960 
ahead you know or you've got like you
can<00:03:04.890> put<00:03:05.070> Reed<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.459> your<00:03:05.550> opponent<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
can put Reed and your opponent that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.070 
can put Reed and your opponent that
they're<00:03:06.090> not<00:03:06.150> going<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.450> addy<00:03:06.660> prism

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
they're not going to have addy prism

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.290 
they're not going to have addy prism
then<00:03:07.709> that's<00:03:08.220> good<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.730> know<00:03:08.850> that's<00:03:09.150> great

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
then that's good you know that's great

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.910 
then that's good you know that's great
with<00:03:09.750> Wyatt<00:03:09.989> app<00:03:10.230> you're<00:03:10.380> putting<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> clouds

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
with Wyatt app you're putting the clouds

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.560 
with Wyatt app you're putting the clouds
back<00:03:11.100> into<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> deck<00:03:11.520> there<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.540> a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
back into the deck there is a

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.910 
back into the deck there is a
possibility<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.260> they're<00:03:13.500> going<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.709> redraw

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
possibility that they're going to redraw

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.949 
possibility that they're going to redraw
these<00:03:14.370> trap<00:03:14.610> cards<00:03:14.910> again<00:03:15.180> which<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.630> not<00:03:15.930> good

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
these trap cards again which is not good

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.300 
these trap cards again which is not good
because<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.440> lot<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.709> time<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.070> don't<00:03:17.100> have

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
because a lot of the time you don't have

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.820 
because a lot of the time you don't have
to<00:03:17.400> redraw<00:03:17.989> warning<00:03:18.989> again<00:03:19.350> because<00:03:19.620> then<00:03:19.739> you

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
to redraw warning again because then you

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.259 
to redraw warning again because then you
have<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.130> find<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.430> level<00:03:20.700> way<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> kill<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.150> you

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
have to find a level way to kill it you

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.090 
have to find a level way to kill it you
know<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> stop<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.470> know<00:03:22.590> because<00:03:22.680> warning

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
know to stop it you know because warning

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.039 
know to stop it you know because warning
is<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> win<00:03:23.580> condition<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.090> itself<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.930> know

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
is a win condition in itself you know

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.690 
is a win condition in itself you know
it's<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.590> can't<00:03:25.830> like<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.280> negate<00:03:26.580> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
it's like you can't like you negate the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.130 
it's like you can't like you negate the
mirror<00:03:26.880> force<00:03:27.120> put<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.420> back<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.720> you've<00:03:27.959> got

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
mirror force put it back in you've got

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.630 
mirror force put it back in you've got
they've<00:03:28.500> got<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> mirror<00:03:28.890> force<00:03:29.160> left<00:03:29.430> and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
they've got a mirror force left and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.310 
they've got a mirror force left and
they've<00:03:29.730> got<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.910> few<00:03:30.120> facedowns<00:03:30.600> later<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.170> in

they've got a few facedowns later on in

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.810 
they've got a few facedowns later on in
the<00:03:31.380> game<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:32.100> one<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.400> those<00:03:32.580> could<00:03:32.790> be

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
the game and then one of those could be

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.550 
the game and then one of those could be
mirror<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.600> you've<00:03:33.750> negated<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.290> put<00:03:34.470> it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
mirror for so you've negated it put it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.750 
mirror for so you've negated it put it
back<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.890> deck<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.280> you've<00:03:35.400> kind<00:03:35.700> of

back in the deck and then you've kind of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.580 
back in the deck and then you've kind of
