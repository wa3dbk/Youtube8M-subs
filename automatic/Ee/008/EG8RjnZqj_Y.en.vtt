as much as on the nose but maybe not

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.040 
as much as on the nose but maybe not
quite<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:10.179> just<00:01:10.390> enough<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.720> lift<00:01:10.899> that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
quite it's just enough to lift that

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.779 
quite it's just enough to lift that
contact<00:01:11.619> point<00:01:11.860> out<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.130> give<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:12.369> some<00:01:12.580> play

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
contact point out to give you some play

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.570 
contact point out to give you some play
so<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.660> can<00:01:13.810> dork<00:01:14.080> around<00:01:14.410> it<00:01:15.190> features

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
so that you can dork around it features

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.240 
so that you can dork around it features
carbon<00:01:16.060> or<00:01:16.179> a<00:01:16.300> three<00:01:16.720> right<00:01:17.470> here<00:01:17.770> under<00:01:18.130> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
carbon or a three right here under the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.559 
carbon or a three right here under the
bindings<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:18.729> what<00:01:18.880> that's<00:01:19.060> going<00:01:19.209> to<00:01:19.270> do<00:01:19.450> is

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
bindings so what that's going to do is

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:20.999 
bindings so what that's going to do is
it's<00:01:19.599> just<00:01:19.869> going<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.020> grab<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.410> energy<00:01:20.800> and

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
it's just going to grab the energy and

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.770 
it's just going to grab the energy and
take<00:01:21.160> it<00:01:21.310> right<00:01:21.580> up<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.910> your<00:01:21.970> contact<00:01:22.420> points

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
take it right up to your contact points

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.870 
take it right up to your contact points
on<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:22.990> rail<00:01:23.170> evenly<00:01:24.069> distribute<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.759> can

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
on the rail evenly distribute so you can

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.260 
on the rail evenly distribute so you can
have<00:01:25.030> nice<00:01:25.240> smooth<00:01:26.110> turns<00:01:27.000> throughout<00:01:28.000> the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
have nice smooth turns throughout the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.779 
have nice smooth turns throughout the
mountain<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:29.170> flat<00:01:29.530> stable<00:01:30.069> zone<00:01:30.099> is<00:01:30.580> going

mountain that flat stable zone is going

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.120 
mountain that flat stable zone is going
to<00:01:30.849> give<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.330> an<00:01:31.630> unbelievable<00:01:32.170> feeling<00:01:32.500> when
