00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 with the girls as they are of inatur of 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.269
 block in spas sometimes for example 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.080
 that they buy a pashmina either by 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.660
 the color by the shape of the picture 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 love they fall in love they took her and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.340
 always end up using the same guard 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.680
 do not despair because today in this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 tutorial I'm going to give you 6 ways 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.359
 6 different ways to save 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.359
 the mines ok 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:39.720
 the most general way to use pashmina 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:42.810
 which is as always is directly 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.650
 so if the simplest but good way 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.140
 There are other ways to use this accessory 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.960
 that besides accessory is like a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.270
 light coat and talking coat 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.490
 liquid that brings us to the number form 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.050
 2 of using them is form number 2 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.120
 suppose that supposes that you are in the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.680
 office and all adored companion of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 work will learn that conditioned thing 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 what happens absolutely all the time 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.650
 then for example in this shirt 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.360
 white and you have your dress pants 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.550
 divine good this guy is a pashmina 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.070
 well capita type 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.780
 so just directly is valued 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.420
 follow yes that we have more see more 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 Sophisticated but what do you think if 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 we take these tips and I with this 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 first tip led her up and already 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.770
 so it is also divine but the second 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.800
 tip the one in red too and he took it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.310
 upwards once more look at the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.979
 wine that remains this is as well as very like 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.740
 very dynasty permission I adjusted I miss 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.580
 only from his hat my mom's 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.950
 year of 12 when you lack a hat and 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.370
 something else is ready that we can 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.690
 say of this this piece is that 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.610
 rectangular yes and that thanks to it be 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.240
 rectangular what we can do too 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.240
 it is this 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.319
 the tips of this rectangle and I'm going to 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.860
 show in a more practical and simple way 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.950
 and neat to take your page 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.170
 What I'm doing is a knot 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.860
 once I have the knot very simple 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.450
 I'm going to throw it in the bone I'm going to 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.430
 leave more the term a little and marked the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.430
 center of the pashmina I give a turn 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.580
 that is why this form is 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.260
 perfect 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.400
 Another way 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.129
 this accessory that leaves the title at 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.370
 that the kittens 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.599
 this way they are using 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 triangular as at that time in 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.660
 the nineties 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.840
 then to the kittens these this guy 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.040
 rockers and this with white arabesques and 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.720
 red background and they used this comes in handy 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.370
 to the neck to have to agree to the school 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.110
 that makes it so 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.989
 because I said I was talking to 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.340
 It is a triangle, so then nothing 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.849
 here we have a rectangle is going to be a 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.890
 little hard to get a triangle of 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.090
 this because we would need a square 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.370
 actually believe that it is perfect but 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.260
 let's try to win then I have 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.849
 my rectangle I'm bending to the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.909
 half and now what I'm going to do is 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.280
 to fold it again but facing 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.790
 tips with tips 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.590
 trying to generate a triangle and with 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.260
 this front what I'm going to do is this 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.450
 came out with the triangle this is a 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.990
 perfect for what he was saying come 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.060
 this is a rectangle so I'm going to 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.319
 tolerate the triangle in front of me in 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.090
 in front of me and she is taking shape and 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.010
 you do not see need to guess you 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.780
 but what are you going to do with this good with 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.750
 this I will not do one is already behind 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.750
 let's put it below 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.710
 perfect this little grandmother 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.639
 when the pompoms for which you 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.500
 then this is the cowboy option if 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:28.270
 is using adora but the version 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.620
 winter but with a kitten we are going to 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.870
 die 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.560
 and then the last 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.870
 of form number 6 to use your page 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.210
 is casting from the alcor I call it 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.660
 curled up because this coiled is very 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.990
 similar to version 2 is to make it 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.360
 in knot but well I 'm going to do this 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.360
 my red box all 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.560
 and then well either very simple 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.400
 that the tips go back 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.400
 then it is already 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.120
 in a mirror 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:21.200
 valera and the last the sheet metal also 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.220
 Dedicated range is like my rectangle 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.470
 negative meters and above as I am 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.840
 who exports very well that way is the 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.790
 rectangle or the tips that 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.070
 they are square or have uneven 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.100
 I like it more uneven as well as 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.220
 I do not want it to be very perfect if 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.260
 I'm going to do is add them 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.330
 accessory really girls towards the 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.370
 eye accessories watch everything 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.530
 we are doing with two things and nothing 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.530
 more then let's continue with this 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.810
 again then I have pashmina to 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.000
 neck so more and look what I'm 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.150
 doing, I'm going to mark them with a 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.220
 belt if I'm very similar to 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.170
 transit of the previous post next 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.170
 advisor and coat I do not know if they saw it 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:15.040
 so what I 'm doing is marking 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:17.770
 waist belt 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.639
 and august 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.360
 and there I stay 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:27.629
 a new version of how leap farming 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.860
 to these as well as very elegant is more 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.139
 for this 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.599
 to wear with a dress pants one 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.840
 shirt or a pear like the one I have 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.909
 now anyway anyway I think that 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.490
 anything looks good on you 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:43.409
 can combine and march around 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.960
 case may not be the color of the belt 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.710
 with any of the colors that the 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.979
 pashmina 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.139
 On the contrary, they can search 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.599
 contrasts of color and doing so as well 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.039
 martÃ­n so good six options for 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.379
 use the mines I do not want to see anyone 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.520
 where the person but as the use of 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.819
 slime 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.500
 I hope you have served them well and nothing 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:07.110
 let's take advantage of this channel what makes 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.389
 we have so that you can do 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.819
 the questions that need consultations 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.740
 opinions or whatever yes so good 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.039
 nothing we keep seeing and I send them a 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.039
 big kiss
