00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
on this makeup look it is so pretty like

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.569 
on this makeup look it is so pretty like
you<00:00:42.780> can't<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.230> tell<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.399> see

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you can't really tell but you can see

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
you can't really tell but you can see
the<00:00:44.760> dramatic<00:00:44.940> mess<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> without<00:00:46.020> my

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
