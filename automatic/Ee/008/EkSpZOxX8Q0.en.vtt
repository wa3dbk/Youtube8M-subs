00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.939
 I was asked in some of the staff without me asking to be jealous of a man because 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.880

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.579

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.440
 the pt is a point 4 but the ace does not do 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.500
 ectc is a tourist point that is also more important to do 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.090

 merkel 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.839
 with a team that misses a correct point 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:21.710
 we have to pay attention 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.079
 W 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.079

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.979
 advantage of the team in this attentive to the question and puts state is a 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.179

 and promised to close the pf 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.800

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.819
 which implied that it would not 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.509
 and this is the settings to move forever like this 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.989
