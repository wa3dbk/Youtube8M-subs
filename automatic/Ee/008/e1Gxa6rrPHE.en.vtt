but it's just gonna injured all the time
and<00:04:25.750> he's<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.230> really<00:04:26.440> good<00:04:26.680> play<00:04:26.830> with<00:04:26.980> his

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
and he's a really good play with his

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.250 
and he's a really good play with his
battle<00:04:27.490> skills<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:27.880> FIFA<00:04:28.270> blame<00:04:28.840> we're<00:04:29.050> alive

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
battle skills and FIFA blame we're alive

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.480 
battle skills and FIFA blame we're alive
he's<00:04:29.440> not<00:04:29.620> very<00:04:29.830> good<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.250> don't<00:04:30.310> think

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
he's not very good and I don't think

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.800 
he's not very good and I don't think
he's<00:04:30.639> really<00:04:30.850> done<00:04:30.970> much<00:04:31.030> my<00:04:31.360> whole<00:04:31.510> city

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
he's really done much my whole city

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.810 
he's really done much my whole city
either<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.740> maybe<00:04:32.919> should<00:04:33.250> be<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.340> downgrade

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
either so maybe should be a downgrade

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.629 
either so maybe should be a downgrade
for<00:04:34.360> movies<00:04:34.600> seventy<00:04:34.990> five<00:04:35.800> or<00:04:36.070> six<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.460> think

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
for movies seventy five or six I think

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.490

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
maybe even still the player guys a final

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.350 
maybe even still the player guys a final

week<00:04:47.680> i<00:04:47.770> think<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.070> was<00:04:48.220> maybe<00:04:48.910> that's<00:04:49.210> a

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
week i think it was maybe that's a

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.700 
week i think it was maybe that's a
turning<00:04:49.630> point<00:04:49.660> for<00:04:49.870> him<00:04:50.050> i<00:04:50.080> don't<00:04:50.260> know<00:04:50.500> maybe

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
turning point for him i don't know maybe

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.440 
turning point for him i don't know maybe
you<00:04:50.889> can<00:04:51.040> get<00:04:51.160> on<00:04:51.280> track<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.760> get<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:51.940> bad<00:04:52.180> form

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
you can get on track and get a bad form

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.300

the<00:04:52.570> news<00:04:52.720> recently<00:04:53.020> i<00:04:53.620> don't<00:04:54.130> know<00:04:54.190> i'm

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
the news recently i don't know i'm

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.730 
the news recently i don't know i'm
thinking<00:04:54.340> maybe<00:04:54.730> it<00:04:55.419> maybe<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:55.930> an<00:04:56.230> 80<00:04:56.380> rate<00:04:56.710> i

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
thinking maybe it maybe to an 80 rate i

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.010 
thinking maybe it maybe to an 80 rate i
think<00:04:57.070> i'd<00:04:57.190> be<00:04:57.340> more<00:04:57.880> suited<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.270> him<00:04:58.570> but

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
think i'd be more suited to him but

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.840 
think i'd be more suited to him but
maybe<00:04:59.230> if<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.680> improve<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.310> future<00:05:00.340> for

him<00:05:03.850> God<00:05:04.090> has<00:05:04.210> been<00:05:04.419> pretty<00:05:04.630> much<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.080> team<00:05:05.320> of

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
him God has been pretty much the team of

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.900 
him God has been pretty much the team of
downgraded<00:05:06.100> players<00:05:06.310> which<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:06.669> believe

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
downgraded players which I believe

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.060 
downgraded players which I believe
deserve<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.419> be<00:05:07.510> downgraded<00:05:08.140> hopefully<00:05:08.890> EA

deserve to be downgraded hopefully EA

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.770 
deserve to be downgraded hopefully EA
can<00:05:09.430> fix<00:05:09.730> them<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:10.120> think<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.450> should<00:05:10.630> be<00:05:10.690> a

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
can fix them I think that should be a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.270 
can fix them I think that should be a
new<00:05:10.930> feature<00:05:11.169> instead<00:05:11.919> of<00:05:12.040> just<00:05:12.190> putting

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
new feature instead of just putting

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960
