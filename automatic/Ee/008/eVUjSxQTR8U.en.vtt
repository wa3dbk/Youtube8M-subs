00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.369
 enchantments and all this we have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.500
 seen along the 0.12 because that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.050
 it just came out yesterday and it's a super version 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.290
 this one of your perversion and good guys 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 let's take this from the third 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.130
 person and good guys let's move on 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.610
 here to do all this good this 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.180
 we take 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.350
 the iron peak 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.350
 the parkings 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.630
 there it is we take it here we have the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.390
 these warts and we're going to start 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.000
 apply this to love to teach to 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.740
 love the some things and one like 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.770
 always the troll bike that can not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.410
 missing in any video and good guys 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.610
 let's hope the good autotune goes to 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.610
 remove this from the car and um 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.940
 been and continues to jump alone 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.609
 keep jumping just me I'm not 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.159
 squeezing but keeps jumping knows 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.530
 now it's a little weird and good as 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.939
 we see we have four experience leaves 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.329
 see how much is needed to charm 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.329
 this 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.259
 well let's have here 9 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 well we are going to have to remove more 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.619
 carboncito and good guys we are going to 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.530
 wait a little bit I'll cut myself I think 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.750
 that this part of the video and guys 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.329
 I will try to see if you can already not 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.009
 let's put the whole island blue and nothing 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.880
 he keeps asking me at 9 am I'll have 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.250
 that bring more good experience this does not 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.980
 I 'm going to come because we're going to kill 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.800
 a little bit of this from 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.580
 of pigs there is a bug that will not let me 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.130
 move what I feel here 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.310
 the items below we put them out and 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.110
 put them back 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.110
 there is the cock bitch cow 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.450
 a few months of fucking points 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.410
 Well, I had this in case something happened 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.600
 like this since 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.200
 tried are reviewed go here that I 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 all sapiens 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.629
 but I do not fill in any of this we do not go 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.420
 to look here for the services that I 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.870
 I left here prepared and and but 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.870
 they go up 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.400
 tampa that is elegant 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.340
 and so you will not have to remove the goal 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 well I'm gonna have to ride out another 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.180
 piglet another piglet 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.090
 I hope that many will not appear, if not 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.580
 I'm going to sleep since here I have the bed 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.920
 what happens to me very quickly and 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.440
 well we're going with this there is 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.599
 we woke up since this video will be 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.290
 a little bit extensive since it will consist of 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.290
 several parts 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.160
 it will not remove this 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.030
 I will not put here because if it will be a 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.000
 bit harder to love something anymore 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.800
 They will ask me for many enchantments 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 well let's put it here and I broke 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.360
 bility means reality and good we give 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.180
 and as you can see we already have it 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.700
 charmed 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.739
 I broke bility schemes slower it 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.769
 is going to break all this we are not going to 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.769
 try to charm something like the sword 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.420
 blame or sharp sharpening good we put it 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.420
 with sharpened 1 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.420
 ok this according to me I will have more damage the 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.100
 sharp is the one that has more damage the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.450
 truth this was epic good come on 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.940
 now let's love what's coming 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.110
 being books 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.110
 over here I have one 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.479
 power 1 good this will serve us as for 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.460
 the bow and as you can see here it 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.380
 love one of this one 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.060
 and then we go to Carl Jung who like 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.610
 I can see it is a long time 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:43.009
 when this happens we will put it here 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.889
 and to say we are going to put him to the sword 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.120
 and then here we put the 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.580
 but he is overwhelmed 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.070
 I think so if he is doomed to this good 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.620
 we can teach since it will be mine 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.289
 I do not know what's going on but that's supported 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.999
 I hope it's repaired fast 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.479
 and some guys will go to the table 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.479
 theo disguise 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.319
 not taken what is being glass 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.200
 we do not create here what being a 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:16.510
 pretty cute little stick and now let's see 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.190
 do not take out to fiddle bottles and 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.220
 to teach you what is coming 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.050
 being those of these positions since it is 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:29.860
 a full tutorial of minecraft and 0.12 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.740

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.260

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.670

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.370

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.680
 put the wart of the neder this is already 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.680

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.530
 already in a series of his rival will already be 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.540
 much more complete since the series 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.180
 survival and after everything that is 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.150

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.540
 be and in minecraft just super fast and 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.600
 you found everything you were not bored 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.360
 quickly since then then later 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.100
 you finish your world since it is very easy 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.620
 do this well let's see if they are already 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.760
 the three of us or we already have the three of us 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.590
 let's change what our little bottle 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.590
 and I do not know how the water is taken here 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.540
 If so done since the mein herr fish 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.650
 that occupies the cauldron 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.650
 we are not going to put here 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.410
 and then here we are going to put this this is 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.930
 like who says the base 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.510
 Well, it's not like that if the base is already 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.820
 then I will show you she puts the cream 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.070
 of magma are made several things that is 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.290
 very very easy to make them and they are 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.760
 great the only good thing that I see that 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.030

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.030

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.710
