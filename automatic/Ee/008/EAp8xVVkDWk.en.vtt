so far up until last game undefeated I
know<00:00:28.980> I've<00:00:29.190> been<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.430> broken<00:00:29.820> record<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.270> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
know I've been a broken record with that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.439 
know I've been a broken record with that
but<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.380> impressive<00:00:32.180> but<00:00:33.180> crazy

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
but that's really impressive but crazy

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.360 
but that's really impressive but crazy
moving<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.899> gotta<00:00:34.079> remember<00:00:34.320> he's<00:00:35.100> qualified

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
moving you gotta remember he's qualified

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.669 
moving you gotta remember he's qualified
for<00:00:35.820> code<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.149> that's<00:00:37.109> pretty<00:00:37.379> darn<00:00:37.530> good

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
for code a that's pretty darn good

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.709 
for code a that's pretty darn good
itself<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.729> I<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.210> anybody<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.600> going

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
itself so I think if anybody was going

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.000 
itself so I think if anybody was going
to<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> game<00:00:40.260> off<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.620> him<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
to take a game off of him and the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.110 
to take a game off of him and the
winning<00:00:41.249> streak<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:41.699> certainly<00:00:41.940> be

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
winning streak it would certainly be

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
winning streak it would certainly be
crazy<00:00:42.569> moving<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:43.350> moving<00:00:43.800> forward<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.579> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
crazy moving now moving forward in this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.939 
crazy moving now moving forward in this
game<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.839> that<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.050> nori<00:00:46.409> is<00:00:46.559> actually

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
game we see that in nori is actually

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.709 
game we see that in nori is actually
going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.159> dropping<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.760> pylon<00:00:48.239> here

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
going to be dropping down a pylon here

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.930 
going to be dropping down a pylon here
instead<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.589> going<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.219> an<00:00:50.280> early<00:00:50.399> expansion

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
instead of going for an early expansion

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.110 
instead of going for an early expansion
or<00:00:51.559> walling<00:00:52.559> off<00:00:52.679> up<00:00:52.889> here<00:00:52.920> now<00:00:53.519> this<00:00:53.909> actually

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
or walling off up here now this actually

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.969 
or walling off up here now this actually
has<00:00:54.479> its<00:00:54.600> own<00:00:54.870> benefits<00:00:55.109> and<00:00:55.589> that<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.799> can

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
has its own benefits and that you can

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.619 
has its own benefits and that you can
create<00:00:56.159> a<00:00:56.249> tight<00:00:56.609> wall<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.999> position<00:00:57.420> very

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
create a tight wall in position very

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.449 
create a tight wall in position very
close<00:00:57.929> to<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.229> mineral<00:00:58.589> line<00:00:58.709> so<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.339> you're

00:00:59.449 --> 00:00:59.459 
close to your mineral line so if you're

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.430 
close to your mineral line so if you're
facing<00:00:59.670> early<00:01:00.209> zergling<00:01:00.600> pressure<00:01:00.839> possibly

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
facing early zergling pressure possibly

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.809 
facing early zergling pressure possibly
before<00:01:01.589> you're<00:01:01.889> able<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.219> complete<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.639> wall

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
before you're able to complete the wall

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.450 
before you're able to complete the wall
down<00:01:03.389> at<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:03.569> ramp<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> zealot<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
down at the ramp and get a zealot up you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.859 
down at the ramp and get a zealot up you
can<00:01:05.640> use<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> probes<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.570> advantage

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
can use the probes to your advantage

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.630 
can use the probes to your advantage
without<00:01:07.170> losing<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> mining<00:01:08.280> time<00:01:08.460> from

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
without losing a lot of mining time from

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
without losing a lot of mining time from
having<00:01:08.909> them<00:01:09.060> run<00:01:09.240> around<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.440> also

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
having them run around and you can also

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
having them run around and you can also
of<00:01:10.860> course<00:01:10.890> duck<00:01:11.430> into<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.790> nice<00:01:12.060> safe

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
of course duck into this nice safe

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
of course duck into this nice safe
position<00:01:12.570> right<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.230> created<00:01:13.680> by

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
position right here that's created by

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.220 
position right here that's created by
the<00:01:14.280> Gateway<00:01:14.820> again<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.510> is<00:01:15.660> just<00:01:15.840> pretty

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
the Gateway again this is just pretty

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.310 
the Gateway again this is just pretty
standard<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.690> something<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:18.780> actually<00:01:18.870> do<00:01:19.140> from

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
standard as something I actually do from

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.450 
standard as something I actually do from
time<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> time<00:01:19.680> when<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.010> playing<00:01:20.130> against

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
time to time when I'm playing against

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.160 
time to time when I'm playing against
zerg<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.910> kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.450> feeling<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.990> they're

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
zerg that kind of feeling like they're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.660 
zerg that kind of feeling like they're
going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.440> doing<00:01:22.590> some<00:01:22.920> type<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> six<00:01:23.460> pool

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
going to be doing some type of six pool

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.450 
going to be doing some type of six pool
something<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.710> since<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.190> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
something like that and since this is a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.390 
something like that and since this is a
multi<00:01:27.150> game<00:01:27.330> series<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> lot<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> times<00:01:29.070> players

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
multi game series a lot of times players

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.180 
multi game series a lot of times players
will<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.390> opt<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:31.080> a<00:01:31.410> way<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> end<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.160> game

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
will just opt for a way to end the game

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.760 
will just opt for a way to end the game
very<00:01:32.700> quickly<00:01:32.730> and<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:34.080> I<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.230> this<00:01:34.530> type<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
very quickly and so I think this type of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.520 
very quickly and so I think this type of
safe<00:01:35.190> play<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.790> gonna<00:01:36.600> lend<00:01:36.840> itself<00:01:37.170> well<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
safe play is gonna lend itself well to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.100 
safe play is gonna lend itself well to
the<00:01:38.190> match<00:01:38.340> overall<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.690> know<00:01:39.810> crazy

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the match overall but you know crazy

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
the match overall but you know crazy
moving<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:40.800> back<00:01:40.980> down<00:01:41.160> in<00:01:41.310> him<00:01:41.490> he's<00:01:41.850> not

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
moving we look back down in him he's not

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
moving we look back down in him he's not
going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.990> any<00:01:43.110> sort<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.650> early

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
going to be going for any sort of early

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
going to be going for any sort of early
cheese<00:01:44.400> or<00:01:44.730> pressure<00:01:45.030> anything<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.140> that

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
know he is still in this tournament he

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.200 
know he is still in this tournament he
is<00:02:23.530> still<00:02:23.740> in<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.010> series<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.550> he<00:02:24.850> cannot

is still in this series and he cannot
let<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.570> distract<00:02:25.960> him<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.530> right<00:02:26.770> now<00:02:26.920> he's

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
let that distract him so right now he's

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.770 
let that distract him so right now he's
probably<00:02:27.130> just<00:02:27.550> moving<00:02:27.910> forward<00:02:28.300> making<00:02:28.540> sure

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
probably just moving forward making sure

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.720 
probably just moving forward making sure
he<00:02:28.930> gets<00:02:29.020> everything<00:02:29.350> just<00:02:29.800> right<00:02:30.100> playing<00:02:30.640> it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
he gets everything just right playing it

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.190 
he gets everything just right playing it
very<00:02:30.760> safe<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.540> that's<00:02:31.630> kind<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:31.930> why<00:02:32.080> he

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
very safe and that's kind of why he

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.960 
very safe and that's kind of why he
built<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> way<00:02:32.650> he<00:02:32.800> did<00:02:33.010> but<00:02:33.460> notice<00:02:33.820> down

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970

heading<00:04:01.900> way<00:04:02.230> out<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.680> base<00:04:02.830> think<00:04:03.310> is

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
heading way out of the base think is

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.100 
heading way out of the base think is
that<00:04:03.489> what<00:04:03.700> circlings<00:04:04.090> should<00:04:04.510> be<00:04:04.690> able<00:04:04.870> to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
that what circlings should be able to

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.240 
that what circlings should be able to
mop<00:04:05.320> that<00:04:05.500> up<00:04:06.540> we<00:04:07.540> do<00:04:07.690> have<00:04:07.870> two<00:04:08.680> units<00:04:09.100> of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
mop that up we do have two units of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.039 
mop that up we do have two units of
equal<00:04:09.610> speed<00:04:09.910> though<00:04:10.150> so<00:04:10.360> this<00:04:10.540> could<00:04:10.750> go<00:04:11.019> on

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
equal speed though so this could go on

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.600 
equal speed though so this could go on
for<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.560> little<00:04:11.830> while<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.160> circling<00:04:12.519> is

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
for a little while the circling is

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.250
