00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
man can finish that's all I care about

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.729 
man can finish that's all I care about
cuz<00:02:30.799> this<00:02:31.840> touch<00:02:32.840> where's<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> finish<00:02:33.500> line

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
cuz this touch where's the finish line

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.930 
cuz this touch where's the finish line
so<00:02:33.950> like<00:02:34.160> really<00:02:34.400> far<00:02:34.549> away<00:02:34.640> probably

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
so like really far away probably

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.910 
so like really far away probably
probably<00:02:35.569> you<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:35.810> another<00:02:35.959> loop<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.470> toiley

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
probably you like another loop to toiley

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.500 
probably you like another loop to toiley
by<00:02:37.190> thing<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.610> think<00:02:37.849> you<00:02:37.940> got<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.180> do<00:02:38.269> another

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
by thing I think you got to do another

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.470 
by thing I think you got to do another
loop<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.930> twirly<00:02:39.260> black<00:02:39.470> flipper<00:02:39.860> yeah<00:02:40.849> that

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
loop in a twirly black flipper yeah that

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.199 
loop in a twirly black flipper yeah that
thing<00:02:42.160> why<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.459> doing<00:02:43.910> there<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:44.900> go<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:46.209> just

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
thing why is it doing there we go I just

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.030 
thing why is it doing there we go I just
think<00:02:47.569> at<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.780> ramp<00:02:48.019> like<00:02:48.319> it's<00:02:48.560> flicking<00:02:48.920> me

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
think at this ramp like it's flicking me

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.839 
think at this ramp like it's flicking me
round<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:51.410> looks<00:02:51.709> mean<00:02:52.069> -<00:02:52.280> right<00:02:52.489> round

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
round it's looks mean - right round

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.650 
round it's looks mean - right round
right<00:02:53.239> round<00:02:54.190> Castle<00:02:55.190> don't<00:02:55.430> finish<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.090> super

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
right round Castle don't finish it super

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.240 
right round Castle don't finish it super
