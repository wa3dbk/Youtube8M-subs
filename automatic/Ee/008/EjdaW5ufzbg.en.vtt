skull t-shirts all the time and they had
an<00:02:27.410> issue<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.830> me<00:02:28.010> my<00:02:28.130> wife<00:02:28.280> had<00:02:28.520> tattoos<00:02:29.150> and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
an issue with me my wife had tattoos and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.170 
an issue with me my wife had tattoos and
stuff<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:31.100> we<00:02:31.250> didn't<00:02:31.460> want<00:02:31.490> our<00:02:31.670> kids<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.060> grow

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
stuff so we didn't want our kids to grow

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.270 
stuff so we didn't want our kids to grow
up<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.600> kind<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.900> environment<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.710> we

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
up in that kind of environment so we

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.750 
up in that kind of environment so we
homeschool

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
homeschool

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.780 
homeschool
which<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.450> something<00:02:36.659> that<00:02:37.099> I'm<00:02:38.099> glad<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.580> did

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
which is something that I'm glad we did

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.930 
which is something that I'm glad we did
because<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:40.260> keeps<00:02:40.379> us<00:02:40.590> together<00:02:40.739> longer<00:02:41.280> burn

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
because it keeps us together longer burn

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.949 
because it keeps us together longer burn
today<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:45.299> can<00:02:45.480> teach<00:02:45.690> them<00:02:45.840> how<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
today and and we can teach them how to

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.250 
today and and we can teach them how to
be<00:02:46.290> good<00:02:46.440> people<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.360> not<00:02:48.360> rely<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:48.720> people

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
be good people and not rely on people

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.050 
be good people and not rely on people
that<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:50.069> no<00:02:50.220> control<00:02:50.670> over
