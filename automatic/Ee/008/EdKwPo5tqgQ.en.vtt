00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
bit of a of a micro mistake now there

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.090 
bit of a of a micro mistake now there
now<00:01:48.420> GG<00:01:48.810> play<00:01:48.960> realizes<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.470> those<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
now GG play realizes that those that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.319 
now GG play realizes that those that
they're<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.340> position<00:01:50.520> he's<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:50.970> some<00:01:51.149> site

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
they're in position he's got some site

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.490 
they're in position he's got some site
and<00:01:51.450> socials<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> open<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.380> are

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.440 
and socials in the open that are
unguarded<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.180> they're<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.639 
unguarded but I think they're out of
position<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.960> he's<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> chase<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
position now he's going to chase in the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.780 
position now he's going to chase in the
middle<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.219> he's<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> end<00:01:56.640> up

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
middle but I think he's going to end up

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.810 
middle but I think he's going to end up

uh<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.310> kind<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.580> unbalancing

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
uh this is kind of the unbalancing

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.030 
uh this is kind of the unbalancing

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
get forces from his other bases to this

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.520 
get forces from his other bases to this
location<00:05:49.699> maybe<00:05:50.419> try<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:50.690> draw<00:05:50.930> them<00:05:50.990> back<00:05:51.139> but

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
location maybe try to draw them back but

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.990 
location maybe try to draw them back but
yeah<00:05:51.830> iris<00:05:52.039> already<00:05:52.370> has<00:05:52.490> everything<00:05:52.639> in

yeah iris already has everything in

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.180 
yeah iris already has everything in
position<00:05:53.320> he's<00:05:54.320> taking<00:05:54.590> down<00:05:54.680> all<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:55.010> tech

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
position he's taking down all the tech

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.439 
position he's taking down all the tech
now<00:05:55.370> he's<00:05:55.610> going<00:05:55.760> to<00:05:55.849> get<00:05:55.970> that<00:05:56.060> high<00:05:56.180> risk

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
now he's going to get that high risk

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.200 
now he's going to get that high risk
layer<00:05:56.660> that's<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.169> end<00:05:57.289> of<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.409> lurkers<00:05:58.210> he
