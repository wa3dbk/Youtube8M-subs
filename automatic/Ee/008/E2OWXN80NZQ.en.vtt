air pocket the egg when you put it in a
tumbler<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.160> water<00:01:02.510> will<00:01:03.510> sink<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> bottom

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
tumbler of water will sink to the bottom

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.640 
tumbler of water will sink to the bottom
of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> water<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.489> horizontal<00:01:05.820> position<00:01:06.650> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
of the water in a horizontal position so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
of the water in a horizontal position so
you'll<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:08.130> before<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.970> break<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you'll know before you break that out of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.850 
you'll know before you break that out of
its<00:01:09.930> shell<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:10.890> quite<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> fresh<00:01:11.580> egg

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
its shell that that's quite a fresh egg

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.030 
its shell that that's quite a fresh egg
if<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.210> fresh<00:01:15.450> it'll<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.439> slightly

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
if it's not so fresh it'll just slightly

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.550 
if it's not so fresh it'll just slightly
tilt<00:01:17.430> into<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.000> semi<00:01:18.390> horizontal<00:01:19.140> position

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
tilt into a semi horizontal position

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.390 
tilt into a semi horizontal position
like<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> one

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like that one

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.560 
like that one
and<00:01:20.540> if<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.689> stale<00:01:22.460> then<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.970> sit<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.360> in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and if it's stale then it will sit up in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.149 
and if it's stale then it will sit up in
a<00:01:24.720> vertical<00:01:25.259> position<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.100> very

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
a vertical position and if it's very

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
a vertical position and if it's very
stale<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.330> it'll<00:01:28.049> float<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
stale like this one it'll float to the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.670 
stale like this one it'll float to the
top<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.840> there's<00:01:31.229> another<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.619> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
top like that now there's another way to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.590 
top like that now there's another way to
tell<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.369> egg<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.610> fresh<00:01:32.790> after<00:01:33.450> it's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
tell if an egg is fresh after it's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.350 
tell if an egg is fresh after it's
broken<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> shell<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.210> here<00:01:36.210> we've

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
broken out of the shell and here we've

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
broken out of the shell and here we've
got<00:01:36.540> three<00:01:36.990> more<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.320> tests<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.040> show<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
got three more little tests to show you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.480 
got three more little tests to show you
the<00:01:39.000> first<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.710> very<00:01:40.950> fresh<00:01:41.250> egg

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the first one is the very fresh egg

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.880 
the first one is the very fresh egg
which<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.270> lovely<00:01:42.479> sort<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.439> plump

which has got a lovely sort of plump

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.639 
which has got a lovely sort of plump
proud<00:01:44.310> yolk<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> look<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> a

put that in poaching water it would just

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.440 
put that in poaching water it would just
well<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.860> disintegrate<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.030> that's<00:02:27.210> why<00:02:27.390> you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
well just disintegrate so that's why you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:36.320 
well just disintegrate so that's why you
don't<00:02:27.660> want<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> stay<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> leg<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.440> poaching
