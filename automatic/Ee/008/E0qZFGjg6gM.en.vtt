00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
is a force velocity curve this is what

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.730 
is a force velocity curve this is what
you<00:00:34.370> would<00:00:34.489> do<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.110> right<00:00:36.260> of<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:36.470> curve

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
you would do to the right of the curve

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.950

here's<00:00:37.700> another<00:00:37.910> visual<00:00:38.120> down<00:00:38.450> here<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:38.810> can

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
here's another visual down here you can

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.260 
here's another visual down here you can
see<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:39.530> speed<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.520> type<00:00:40.760> of<00:00:40.910> fight<00:00:41.060> already

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
see is speed that type of fight already

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.480 
see is speed that type of fight already
has<00:00:41.480> exposed<00:00:41.900> to<00:00:42.020> speed<00:00:42.350> see<00:00:42.890> there's<00:00:43.340> no

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
has exposed to speed see there's no

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.830 
has exposed to speed see there's no
reason<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.850> train<00:00:44.120> them<00:00:44.240> to<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.480> right<00:00:44.660> of<00:00:44.780> the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
practices straight training he could

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.569 
practices straight training he could
read<00:01:53.750> for<00:01:53.960> yourselves<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.680> understand<00:01:55.189> the

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
read for yourselves and understand the

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:56.920 
read for yourselves and understand the
science<00:01:55.790> return<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.390> tell<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.659> there's<00:01:56.840> no

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
science return to tell you there's no

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.760 
science return to tell you there's no
way<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.079> dumb<00:01:57.409> this<00:01:57.590> down<00:01:58.000> alright<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.720> in<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
way to dumb this down alright so in the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.590 
way to dumb this down alright so in the
way<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.189> flip<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:01.640> has<00:02:01.820> say<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.060> had<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.329> fire

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
way to flip that has say you had a fire

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.749 
way to flip that has say you had a fire
like<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.049> George<00:02:03.350> Foreman<00:02:03.409> with<00:02:04.009> heavy<00:02:04.399> hands

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
like a George Foreman with heavy hands

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.169 
like a George Foreman with heavy hands
brute<00:02:05.270> power<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:06.560> know<00:02:06.740> he<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.970> know<00:02:08.060> he

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
brute power you know he you know he

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.430 
brute power you know he you know he
would<00:02:08.330> not<00:02:08.479> guys<00:02:08.660> down<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.170> highest

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
would not guys down the highest

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.589 
would not guys down the highest
commercials<00:02:10.369> ever<00:02:10.519> no<00:02:10.729> doubt<00:02:10.910> but<00:02:11.330> he<00:02:11.420> was<00:02:11.569> a

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
commercials ever no doubt but he was a

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.860 
commercials ever no doubt but he was a
slower<00:02:11.959> type<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.410> fighter<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:13.489> know<00:02:13.870> Trudeau

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
slower type of fighter you know Trudeau

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.300 
slower type of fighter you know Trudeau
if<00:02:15.050> it's<00:02:15.200> not<00:02:15.319> broke<00:02:15.500> till<00:02:15.650> trying<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.950> fix<00:02:16.130> it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
if it's not broke till trying to fix it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.860 
if it's not broke till trying to fix it
but<00:02:16.400> if<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.580> have<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> fighter<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.569> that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
but if you have a fighter like that that

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.030 
but if you have a fighter like that that
is<00:02:17.989> heavier<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.349> handed<00:02:18.739> it's<00:02:18.830> already

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
is heavier and handed it's already

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.890 
is heavier and handed it's already
proved<00:02:19.280> strong<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:20.540> you're<00:02:20.690> trying<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
proved strong but you're trying to

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.080 
proved strong but you're trying to
crease<00:02:21.110> his<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.680> power<00:02:22.100> now<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:22.880> his

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
crease his you know power now that's his

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.190 
crease his you know power now that's his
fighter<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.690> would<00:02:23.810> want<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:23.989> train

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
fighter that you would want to train

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.960 
fighter that you would want to train
more<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.769> right<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.580> force<00:02:25.819> velocity

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
more to the right of the force velocity

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.440 
more to the right of the force velocity
curve<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.410> he's<00:02:28.100> already<00:02:28.310> strong<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.239> want<00:02:29.390> to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
curve so he's already strong you want to

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.720 
curve so he's already strong you want to
train<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.870> right<00:02:30.310> creases<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.340> know<00:02:31.549> do

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
train to the right creases you know do

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.490 
train to the right creases you know do
some<00:02:31.910> more<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.569> know<00:02:32.600> reactive<00:02:33.110> method

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
some more you know reactive method

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.229 
some more you know reactive method
training<00:02:34.480> plyometric<00:02:35.480> training<00:02:36.519> in<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.730> you

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
training plyometric training in that you

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.280 
training plyometric training in that you
know<00:02:38.360> you'll<00:02:38.510> bring<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.959> right<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
know you'll bring it to the right of the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.630 
know you'll bring it to the right of the
curve<00:02:39.470> which<00:02:39.620> will<00:02:39.739> increase<00:02:40.069> his<00:02:40.190> punching

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
curve which will increase his punching

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.030 
curve which will increase his punching
power<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.870> depends<00:02:42.319> on<00:02:42.650> different

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
power so this depends on different

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.550 
power so this depends on different
fighter<00:02:43.400> for<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.390> example<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.810> email<00:02:45.260> a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
fighter for the example in that email a

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.979 
fighter for the example in that email a
lighter<00:02:46.130> hand<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.519> guy<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:47.750> know<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:47.930> not

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
lighter hand a guy you know it's not

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.089 
lighter hand a guy you know it's not
going<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.260> happen<00:02:48.410> overnight<00:02:48.739> but<00:02:49.069> you

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
going to happen overnight but you

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.289 
going to happen overnight but you
