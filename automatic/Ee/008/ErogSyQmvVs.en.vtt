poisonous appointment boss sickness so I

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.640

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
should say which poison ivy and probably

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.740 
should say which poison ivy and probably
well<00:00:13.650> she's<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> pretty<00:00:14.130> easy<00:00:14.309> boss<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.910> takes

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
well she's a pretty easy boss but takes

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.550 
well she's a pretty easy boss but takes
a<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.410> bit<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.859> time<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.730> beat<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
a little bit of time to beat and I

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.200 
a little bit of time to beat and I
thought<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.369> probably<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> funniest

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
thought that was probably the funniest

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.439 
thought that was probably the funniest
cutscene<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.460> don't<00:00:24.150> know<00:00:24.240> why<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
cutscene it's just I don't know why I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.790 
cutscene it's just I don't know why I
just<00:00:24.810> thought<00:00:24.900> that's<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.529> funniest

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
just thought that's the funniest

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.660 
just thought that's the funniest
cutscene<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.939> anyway<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:29.160> soon<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.429> this

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
cutscene but anyway so as soon as this

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.420 
cutscene but anyway so as soon as this
cutscene<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.210> over<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.779> beat<00:00:31.019> her<00:00:31.230> there<00:00:31.590> well

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
when they spit out bricks you have to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.310 
when they spit out bricks you have to
wait<00:00:45.059> till<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.329> spit<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.629> enough<00:00:46.020> bricks

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
wait till they spit out enough bricks

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920 
wait till they spit out enough bricks
and<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:46.710> build<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> destroy<00:00:48.210> each<00:00:48.570> one

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and then build them and destroy each one

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.830 
and then build them and destroy each one
and<00:00:49.579> then<00:00:51.440> poison<00:00:52.440> ivy<00:00:52.820> will<00:00:53.820> jump<00:00:54.539> from<00:00:54.600> one

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and then poison ivy will jump from one

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
and then poison ivy will jump from one
to<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:54.989> other<00:00:57.680> but<00:00:58.760> there's<00:00:59.760> some<00:01:00.059> weird

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
to the other but there's some weird

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.860 
to the other but there's some weird
glitch<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.649> apparently<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.820> spit<00:01:03.300> out<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
glitch that apparently they spit out the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
glitch that apparently they spit out the
one<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> middle<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.920> poison<00:01:05.460> ivy<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> in
