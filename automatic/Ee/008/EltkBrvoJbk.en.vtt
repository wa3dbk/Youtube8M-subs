00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello and welcome to hardware rat in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.429
 this video the update of the 300 euro 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.509
 game computers march 2014 as 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 rakehand the amd athlon 2x 740 with 4 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.090
 times 3 2 ghz 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.750
 he has a turbo core of 3.7 ghz 65 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.760
 watt tdp 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 and it will be delivered in the box version 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.199
 that means a cooler is already there 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 I had already used the process 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.970
 all at my 250 euro gaming pc 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.250
 current games should be normal 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.660
 I can run smoothly though 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 Do not promise that for example at 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 so vast slaughter in total it was 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 then it's really fluid, too 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.510
 if that is not so often 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.460
 occur as mainboard the ice rock fm 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:52.110
 2a 55 mvg 3+ with the amd a55 chips 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.710
 it has usb 2 sata 22 ddr3 ram banks pci 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.890
 express 2.0 a 5.1 sound chip and am 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.359
 euro panel twice ps2 vga can unfortunately 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.969
 not be used as these processes 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.570
 can have integrated graphics unit has 4 x 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.880
 usb 2 a lan socket and triangle 35 mm 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.869
 ping for the sound chip and as 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.930
 RAM 4 GB of crucial ddr3 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.030
 1600 dimm ddr3 1600 and cl 11 are whole 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.040
 okay and four gigabytes are enough 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.509
 for gamer is still out of battlefield 4 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.430
 thereby 1 playfully the most space 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.869
 needs and it only needs a maximum 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.920
 25gb then as hard disks the 500gb 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.509
 western digital blue 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 it is a very fast disk 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.759
 thanks to 7,200 revolutions and 3 5 inches 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 design and 500 gigabytes can 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.899
 be enough if you regularly cleaned up 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.149
 as graphics card the 1 gbps raiden hds 77 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.189
 70 she definitely creates each one 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.630
 play fluent though 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.880
 Of course it depends on the game 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.210
 on which graphics settings as 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.210
 power supply the 350w peak system power7 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.299
 as power hungry the pc is nothing 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.780
 therefore, 350 watts are enough and still 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.490
 size the aerocool v3 xe trends it is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.469
 a red shining very cheap 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
 housing but of course you are allowed yourself 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.250
 decide which they wanted to accept 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.720
 then thank you for watching me 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.530
 I have the video has failed 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.209
 if that's how 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.440
 older than four months is the ask 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.700
 description will look there too 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.500
 click on each link 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 this by their motto latest version 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.360
 then until the next video
