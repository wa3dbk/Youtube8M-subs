because<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.950> filter<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.630> passenger

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
because the filter is on the passenger

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.370 
because the filter is on the passenger
side<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> motor<00:00:16.830> right<00:00:17.789> there

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
side of the motor right there

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.320 
side of the motor right there
easiest<00:00:19.380> way<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.619> get<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:20.910> up<00:00:21.090> top

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
easiest way to get to it from up top

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.660 
easiest way to get to it from up top
with<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.630> strap<00:00:21.930> wrench

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
with the strap wrench

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
probably not in place but so then get

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
probably not in place but so then get
your<00:00:35.000> from<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> top<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> motor<00:00:36.840> we're
