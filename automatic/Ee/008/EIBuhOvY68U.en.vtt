talked me into getting the Berlin

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
probably because she has a black one

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.850 
probably because she has a black one
already<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.050> she<00:02:07.140> wants<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.410> steal<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.710> from

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:36.760 
think it's like really unique because it

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.870 
think it's like really unique because it
has<00:07:36.790> what<00:07:37.720> is<00:07:37.810> this<00:07:38.010> 53<00:07:39.010> on<00:07:39.280> the<00:07:39.310> back<00:07:39.580> of<00:07:39.760> it

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880
