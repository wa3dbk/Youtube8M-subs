finish and you'll see a dramatic before
and<00:00:42.030> after<00:00:42.300> difference<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and after difference but if you have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.200 
and after difference but if you have
something<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.190> already<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.789> actually

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
something that's already in actually

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
something that's already in actually
good<00:00:45.660> shape<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.890> hard<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
good shape it's really hard to make a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279

dramatic<00:00:47.579> before<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.719> after<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> difference

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
dramatic before and after a difference

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.380 
dramatic before and after a difference
but<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.370> you'd<00:00:50.520> look<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> gloss

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
but I think if you'd look at the gloss

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.709 
but I think if you'd look at the gloss
coming<00:00:52.289> off<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> pane<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.539> see

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
coming off this pane I think you can see

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.290 
coming off this pane I think you can see
that<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.020> accomplished<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.940> other<00:00:57.059> cool

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that we accomplished that the other cool

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.819 
that we accomplished that the other cool
thing<00:00:57.510> about<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.590> easy

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
thing about this is it was really easy

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.160 
thing about this is it was really easy
to<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.480> again<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.600> didn't<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to do again we didn't have to use a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.709 
to do again we didn't have to use a
compound<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> medium<00:01:02.699> polish<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.300> were<00:01:03.449> able
