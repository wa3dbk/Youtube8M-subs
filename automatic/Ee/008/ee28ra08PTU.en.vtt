00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.890
 and john legend sixties i hope you 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.790
 all very very well but in all 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.230
 case I form it we find ourselves 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.730
 today for episode number two 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.279
 from this group all a sturridge form 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.559
 guys then with a first wave 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.090
 rather nice with players in 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.320
 Gold players money players in 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.370
 always bronze this technique of 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.739
 changes of posts obviously 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.360
 but also the technique of chemistry 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.070
 stealth that I used with the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.120
 players in silver and bronze so 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.210
 it is true that I already told him in 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.340
 in some episodes but I take this opportunity 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.590
 to talk about using the technique of 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.870
 chemistry stiles not with the price 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.850
 maximum a350 but do not hesitate to 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.620
 increase it me what I do is that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.720
 I increase it to a maximum of 5000 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.009
 there really is way to drop holes 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.180
 on two really good deals 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.399
 especially with the bronze players 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.500
 the man we moved find a pierce and 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.750
 m picture in shadow man if I say 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.820
 no bullshit and and frankly there is 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.960
 really way to get really good 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.509
 benefited with these techniques from 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 chemistry style given that people 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.069
 often swing the players a little 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.869
 little like that without paying attention to 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.159
 the importance of the chemistry card 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.560
 so it's true that there is really a way 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.079
 to do very good business 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.209
 as with the noble cavalryman of london 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.679
 so there are quite a few of them who 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.049
 must surely ask the question of 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.090
 why they buy players in 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.759
 shadow man of the players then 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.139
 pose at their base position and it happens 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.850
 to resell them a lot so what 

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:45.409
 I can advise you to do what 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.770
 you do if you take guys who 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.420
 are 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.240
 midfields that is to say m to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 death cncm is what you do it's 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.450
 that in the search you do not touch 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.509
 not at the prices nor at the post you put 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.780
 just hunters catalyst or man's 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.149
 The shadow 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.060
 you do research on these three 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.100
 different styles and there will be some 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.200
 price differences that are impressive 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.099
 that is, you can often 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.420
 fall for example I take the example 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.640
 of ingots one can pick you by 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.019
 example not once on my account 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.629
 main I had chopin for example 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.700
 then hunters to 1800 and you can the 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.569
 resell like that at 3500 4000 so that's 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.519
 really very easy profits and that 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.510
 not necessarily a lot of time 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.450
 I mean you start a search 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.950
 and here you are, especially 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.390
 with those callejón that's what I had 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.930
 that I will do with both cases the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.579
 roms in this episode the callejón mc that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.599
 walking super good besides I you 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.120
 advise going there for a ride 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.180
 and that's really one of the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.799
 major one of the techniques that I 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.220
 did you want to talk to you in this 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.480
 episode 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.400
 so it's true that I got some feedback 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.110
 rather positive too compared to the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.590
 first episode of wolf a form 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.180
 Sturridge 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.739
 I saw that people were rather 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.200
 agree with me that it is true that there 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.700
 had brought some freshness and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.319
 we were going around in circles so it was 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.609
 damage and so the fact that they have this 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.230
 king is a strict form I bring back a 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.389
 little bit of freshness on this chain 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.859
 and is called pleasure I wanted to open 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.970
 a little parenthesis before the end of 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.959
 this video to tell you about my 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.549
 skype account it's true that I see 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.780
 that there is a lot of people that's true 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.280
 that I have listened to myself and have not 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.610
 long good knowing that I'm connecting 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.680
 once every three months 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.120
 do not be disappointed if I do not respond to 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.800
 your messages or stuff like that but 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.630
 I really connect that very little about 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.220
 skype that's why I want you 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.650
 really advise me to join on 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.420
 twitter where I am much more 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.890
 assets again thanks for all your 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.240
 Skype messages I just read 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.430
 it's only a few minutes ago 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.570
 really great fun thanks for all 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.070
 your comments too I say to the 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.030
 next for new videos 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.030
