further<00:00:23.000> than<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.390> other<00:00:23.619> and<00:00:24.619> this<00:00:24.890> is

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
further than the other and this is

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.499 
further than the other and this is
something<00:00:25.519> that<00:00:25.640> always<00:00:25.789> bothered<00:00:26.269> us

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
something that always bothered us

the<00:00:52.310> key<00:00:52.520> here<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.510> mounts<00:00:54.380> are

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
the key here is that the mounts are

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.370 
the key here is that the mounts are
symmetrically<00:00:55.220> located<00:00:55.250> on<00:00:56.030> either<00:00:56.990> side<00:00:57.350> of

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
or non symmetrical the key to making

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.490 
or non symmetrical the key to making
this<00:01:05.600> happen<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:06.080> relocating<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.860> muffler

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.510 

and<00:01:12.250> so<00:01:12.610> what<00:01:12.850> we<00:01:13.000> do<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:14.500> we<00:01:17.400> instead<00:01:18.400> of

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
and so what we do is we instead of

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.180 
and so what we do is we instead of
having<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.940> muffler<00:01:19.510> attaching<00:01:20.140> appear<00:01:21.070> on

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
having the muffler attaching appear on

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.970 
having the muffler attaching appear on
the<00:01:21.280> subframe<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:22.570> now<00:01:22.750> attaches<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.680> tab

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
the subframe it now attaches to this tab

on the bottom of the saddlebag bracket
in<00:01:27.070> order<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.370> make<00:01:27.490> this<00:01:27.640> possible<00:01:27.940> there<00:01:28.780> is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
in order to make this possible there is

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.590 
in order to make this possible there is
an<00:01:29.620> adapter<00:01:30.220> pipe<00:01:30.460> that's<00:01:30.730> needed<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.420> is

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
an adapter pipe that's needed this is

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.040 
an adapter pipe that's needed this is
sold<00:01:31.960> separately<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:34.090> reason<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.810> it's

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
sold separately the reason that it's

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.330 
sold separately the reason that it's
sold<00:01:35.200> separately<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.740> because<00:01:36.070> there<00:01:36.220> are<00:01:36.250> two

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
sold separately is because there are two

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.660 
sold separately is because there are two
versions<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.240> part<00:01:37.480> one<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.470> up<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.950> 2009

always of course tell is the later bikes

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.250 
always of course tell is the later bikes

version<00:02:05.200> however<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:06.369> either<00:02:06.610> need<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.119> use

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
version however you either need to use

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.400 
version however you either need to use
the<00:02:07.630> stock<00:02:07.900> exhaust<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:10.509> or<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.080> need<00:02:11.260> to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
the stock exhaust and or or you need to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.990 
the stock exhaust and or or you need to
do<00:02:11.560> something<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:11.920> what<00:02:12.400> we've<00:02:12.550> done<00:02:12.700> here

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
do something that what we've done here

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.530 
do something that what we've done here
the<00:02:13.420> reason<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the reason for that is that the the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.140 
the reason for that is that the the
stock<00:02:17.410> exhaust<00:02:17.739> has<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> band<00:02:18.430> around<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.940> which

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
stock exhaust has a band around it which

advantage<00:02:56.049> this<00:02:56.680> system<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.340> we<00:02:58.090> use<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
advantage this system is we use the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.810 
advantage this system is we use the
quick<00:02:59.380> lock<00:02:59.620> system<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.340> aren't
