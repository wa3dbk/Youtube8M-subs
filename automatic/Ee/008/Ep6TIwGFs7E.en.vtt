00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and then I'm just gonna combining our

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.830 
and then I'm just gonna combining our
peanut<00:00:56.309> butter<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.969> I've<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.629> some

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
peanut butter so I've just got some

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.130 
peanut butter so I've just got some
crunchy<00:00:58.379> peanut<00:00:59.370> butter<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:01:00.000> using<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
crunchy peanut butter and I'm using a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
crunchy peanut butter and I'm using a
good<00:01:01.590> organic<00:01:01.859> one<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> doesn't<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.789> any

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
good organic one it doesn't have any

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.670 
good organic one it doesn't have any
added<00:01:03.870> sugar<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.990> helps<00:01:07.530> if

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
added sugar so that really helps if

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
added sugar so that really helps if
you're<00:01:07.799> using<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.460> sugar<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.510> might

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you're using one with sugar you might

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
you're using one with sugar you might
like<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> use<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.100> less<00:01:11.670> peanut

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
like to use a little bit less peanut

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.160 
like to use a little bit less peanut
butter<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> might<00:01:12.720> find<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.990> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
butter because you might find that it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
butter because you might find that it's
too<00:01:13.229> sweet<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:20.240> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
too sweet but really it's up to you this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.499 
too sweet but really it's up to you this
is<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> most<00:01:21.600> addictive<00:01:22.049> stuff<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
is the most addictive stuff and then you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.179 
is the most addictive stuff and then you
just<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> let<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.049> cool<00:01:25.110> down<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
just want to let it cool down so that

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300
