the Nexus and I'll show you how to do

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.819 
the Nexus and I'll show you how to do
that<00:00:55.379> after<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.660> finally<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.649> light

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that after this and finally your light

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
that after this and finally your light
Nexus<00:00:59.399> runs<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.180> Sun<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
Nexus runs off the Sun and it's the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.100 
Nexus runs off the Sun and it's the
slowest<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.770> most<00:01:02.010> constant<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.110> depending

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
slowest but most constant and depending

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.039 
slowest but most constant and depending
on<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.799> material<00:01:05.309> material<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.360> use<00:01:06.630> above

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on what material material you use above

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
on what material material you use above
these<00:01:07.920> totems<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.210> it'll<00:01:10.049> run<00:01:10.229> faster<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
these totems here it'll run faster so

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.290 
these totems here it'll run faster so
glass<00:01:12.000> being<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> slowest

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.740 

so<00:01:16.300> each<00:01:16.630> nexus<00:01:17.230> needs<00:01:18.030> its<00:01:19.030> own<00:01:19.270> type<00:01:19.630> of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
so each nexus needs its own type of

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
so each nexus needs its own type of
materials<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.590> color<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.700> chalk<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.650> in<00:01:24.040> here

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
materials and color of chalk so in here

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140 
materials and color of chalk so in here
we<00:01:25.450> can<00:01:25.660> see<00:01:25.870> four<00:01:26.770> neutral<00:01:27.370> we<00:01:27.640> need<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.940> use

stone<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.959> redstone<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.950> make<00:02:39.130> sure<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.400> put

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
stone and redstone so make sure you put

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.580 
stone and redstone so make sure you put
it<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.820> those<00:02:40.600> positions<00:02:40.959> because<00:02:41.350> any

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
it in that those positions because any

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.720 
it in that those positions because any
other<00:02:41.650> positions<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.400> won't<00:02:42.580> work<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.730> all

other positions it won't work and all
you<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.090> with<00:02:46.240> this<00:02:46.360> RK<00:02:46.810> compound<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.680> put<00:02:47.890> it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you do with this RK compound is put it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.130 
you do with this RK compound is put it
in<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.310> furnace<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.820> cook<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.209> one<00:02:49.720> arcane

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
in a furnace and cook it one arcane

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.850 
in a furnace and cook it one arcane
compound<00:02:50.650> gives<00:02:50.920> through<00:02:51.250> arcane<00:02:51.760> ash<00:02:52.860> so

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
compound gives through arcane ash so

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.809 
compound gives through arcane ash so
once<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.430> materials<00:02:54.730> ready

except this is the dark Nexus here I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.869 
except this is the dark Nexus here I
used<00:04:04.640> red<00:04:04.909> chalk<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.390> place<00:04:05.629> this<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.879> nether

used red chalk to place this and nether

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.880 
used red chalk to place this and nether
brick<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.269> obsidian<00:04:08.540> there's<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.500> light<00:04:09.709> one

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890

brick and obsidian there's a light one
again<00:04:10.189> and<00:04:10.400> here's<00:04:11.209> your<00:04:11.450> neutral<00:04:11.840> one<00:04:12.370> now

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
again and here's your neutral one now

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.029 
again and here's your neutral one now
with<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.790> neutral<00:04:14.349> you<00:04:15.349> will<00:04:15.470> need<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.799> dig

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
with the neutral you will need to dig

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.120 
with the neutral you will need to dig
underneath<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.690> I've<00:04:18.049> gone<00:04:18.440> from<00:04:18.859> this

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
underneath it so I've gone from this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.950 
underneath it so I've gone from this
block<00:04:20.949> which<00:04:21.949> is<00:04:21.979> in<00:04:22.280> line<00:04:22.520> with<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.960> stones

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
block which is in line with the stones

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.580 
block which is in line with the stones
here<00:04:24.380> three<00:04:24.949> count<00:04:25.940> three<00:04:26.270> from<00:04:26.539> this<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.350> one

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
here three count three from this so one

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.000 
here three count three from this so one
two<00:04:28.340> three<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.539> that'll<00:04:30.350> be<00:04:30.470> directly

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
two three and that'll be directly

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.770 
two three and that'll be directly
underneath<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.960> Nexus<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.680> this<00:04:33.949> and<00:04:34.780> for

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
underneath the Nexus like this and for

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.260 
underneath the Nexus like this and for
this<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.139> gain<00:04:36.289> charge<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:37.400> just<00:04:37.430> place<00:04:37.910> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
this to gain charge you just place a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.020 
this to gain charge you just place a
bucket<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.320> liquid<00:04:39.650> essence<00:04:40.280> like<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:40.850> and

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
bucket of liquid essence like that and

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.710 
bucket of liquid essence like that and
that<00:04:41.419> Nexus<00:04:42.350> will<00:04:42.560> slowly<00:04:42.919> absorb<00:04:43.760> that

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
that Nexus will slowly absorb that

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.350 
that Nexus will slowly absorb that
liquid<00:04:45.199> essence<00:04:45.530> into<00:04:45.889> it<00:04:46.070> now<00:04:47.030> this<00:04:47.300> neutral

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
liquid essence into it now this neutral

liquid essence into it now this neutral
Nexus<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.510> wouldn't<00:04:50.840> recommend<00:04:51.139> making

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
Nexus I wouldn't recommend making

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.140 
Nexus I wouldn't recommend making
because<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.580> needs<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.240> bucket<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:54.940> they<00:04:55.940> don't

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
because it needs a bucket and they don't

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.330 
because it needs a bucket and they don't
give<00:04:56.419> much<00:04:56.840> essence<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.860> they're<00:04:58.220> pretty

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
give much essence and they're pretty

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.020 
give much essence and they're pretty
rare<00:04:58.639> to<00:04:58.669> find<00:04:58.820> so<00:04:59.510> in<00:04:59.870> the<00:05:00.500> same<00:05:00.740> time<00:05:01.099> you

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
rare to find so in the same time you

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.839 
rare to find so in the same time you
could<00:05:02.180> make<00:05:02.419> this<00:05:02.660> light<00:05:03.110> Nexus<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.310> that'll

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
could make this light Nexus and that'll

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.200 
could make this light Nexus and that'll
generate<00:05:05.690> slowly<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.770> bit<00:05:07.490> slower<00:05:08.349> then<00:05:10.210> you

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
generate slowly a bit slower then you

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.650 
generate slowly a bit slower then you
know<00:05:11.330> finding<00:05:11.840> liquid<00:05:12.800> essence<00:05:13.330> but<00:05:14.330> it'll<00:05:14.539> be

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
know finding liquid essence but it'll be

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.930 
know finding liquid essence but it'll be
enough<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.729> also<00:05:16.729> your<00:05:17.599> dark<00:05:18.220> Nexus<00:05:19.220> can<00:05:19.699> just

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
enough and also your dark Nexus can just

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.400 
enough and also your dark Nexus can just
sacrifice<00:05:20.570> creatures

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
sacrifice creatures

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.100 
sacrifice creatures
I'll<00:05:21.470> just<00:05:21.800> spawn<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.789> sheep<00:05:23.090> here

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
I'll just spawn a sheep here

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.920 
I'll just spawn a sheep here
just<00:05:25.950> like<00:05:26.130> this<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:27.150> reaches<00:05:27.570> like<00:05:27.720> that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
just like this and it reaches like that

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.000 
just like this and it reaches like that
close<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.520> get<00:05:29.520> absorbed<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.800> turned<00:05:31.800> into

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
close to get absorbed and turned into

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.580 
close to get absorbed and turned into
essence<00:05:32.520> even<00:05:33.480> mobs<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.900> get<00:05:34.170> close<00:05:34.410> to<00:05:34.560> it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
essence even mobs that get close to it

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.110 
essence even mobs that get close to it
will<00:05:34.860> be<00:05:34.890> absorbed<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.580> turned<00:05:35.760> into<00:05:35.940> essence

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
will be absorbed and turned into essence

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.530 
will be absorbed and turned into essence
yeah<00:05:39.120> so<00:05:39.300> that's<00:05:39.920> how<00:05:40.920> it's<00:05:41.250> craft<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:42.060> Nexus

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
yeah so that's how it's craft the Nexus

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.860 
yeah so that's how it's craft the Nexus
and<00:05:43.460> out<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.640> all<00:05:44.790> of<00:05:44.910> them<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.150> would<00:05:45.330> recommend

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
and out of all of them I would recommend

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.140 
and out of all of them I would recommend
creating<00:05:46.140> this<00:05:46.560> light<00:05:46.890> Nexus<00:05:47.400> because<00:05:48.030> it

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
creating this light Nexus because it

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.540 
creating this light Nexus because it
does<00:05:48.330> generate<00:05:48.630> enough<00:05:49.200> essence<00:05:49.650> during<00:05:50.430> the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
does generate enough essence during the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.910 
does generate enough essence during the
day<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:51.600> especially<00:05:51.780> if<00:05:52.230> you're<00:05:52.350> storing<00:05:52.590> it

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
day and especially if you're storing it

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.770 
day and especially if you're storing it
in<00:05:53.100> a<00:05:53.250> manner<00:05:53.430> battery<00:05:53.790> or<00:05:54.360> something<00:05:54.480> like

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
in a manner battery or something like

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.830 
in a manner battery or something like
that<00:05:55.370> then<00:05:56.370> you'll<00:05:56.550> have<00:05:56.730> plenty<00:05:56.970> of<00:05:57.180> essence

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
that then you'll have plenty of essence

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.430 
that then you'll have plenty of essence
