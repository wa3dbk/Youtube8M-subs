00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
cause i live in markham were just really

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.410 
cause i live in markham were just really
close<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.360> Brampton<00:00:36.840> Canada<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.420> that's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
close to Brampton Canada and that's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.319 
close to Brampton Canada and that's
going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.640> whereas<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> comes<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.180> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
going to do this whereas it comes with a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.260 
going to do this whereas it comes with a
amplifier<00:00:42.899> itself<00:00:43.230> i<00:00:43.590> took<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> screw<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:45.059> us

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
amplifier itself i took the screw for us

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.830 
amplifier itself i took the screw for us
already<00:00:45.989> things<00:00:47.000> hold<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.149> by<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:48.360> screws

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
already things hold up by two screws

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.930 
already things hold up by two screws
this<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.890> tough<00:00:50.219> material<00:00:50.640> by<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> way

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this is really tough material by the way

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.740 
this is really tough material by the way
come<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.020> amp<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.469> course<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.910> 345

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
come on the amp of course and the 345

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.700 
come on the amp of course and the 345
345<00:00:55.140> mono<00:00:55.559> jack<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.520> our<00:00:57.449> Charter<00:00:57.870> which

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
345 mono jack and our Charter which

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
345 mono jack and our Charter which
charges<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.550> directly<00:01:00.300> charges<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> battery

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
charges to directly charges the battery

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.420 
charges to directly charges the battery
so<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.739> take<00:01:01.980> them<00:01:02.129> out<00:01:02.280> every

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so I'm going to take them out every

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.950 
so I'm going to take them out every
single<00:01:02.730> time<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:02.969> damage<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.510> circus

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
single time and damage your circus

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.590 
single time and damage your circus
somehow<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> since<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.729> will<00:01:05.909> open<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
somehow and since I will open it up and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.859 
somehow and since I will open it up and
just<00:01:07.320> lift<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.540> here's<00:01:09.540> where<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
just lift this up and here's where the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
just lift this up and here's where the
battery<00:01:10.140> goes<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.560> didn't<00:01:10.830> came<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.159> battery

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
battery goes it didn't came of battery

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.460 
battery goes it didn't came of battery
so<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.750> own<00:01:12.869> battery<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.290> there

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so I just put my own battery in there

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.420 
so I just put my own battery in there
make<00:01:14.189> sure<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.060> used<00:01:15.350> rechargeable<00:01:16.350> 1.2<00:01:17.130> volt

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
make sure you used rechargeable 1.2 volt

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
make sure you used rechargeable 1.2 volt
battery<00:01:17.970> anything<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.409> higher<00:01:19.740> voltage

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
battery anything with a higher voltage

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
battery anything with a higher voltage
in<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.030> give<00:01:21.560> distortion<00:01:22.560> noise

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
in that will just give distortion noise

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.249 
in that will just give distortion noise
like<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.210> buzz<00:01:24.210> noise<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:25.470> regular<00:01:26.310> volume

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
like a buzz noise like regular volume

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.420 
like a buzz noise like regular volume
and<00:01:29.299> those<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.479> circuit<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.430> conductors

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and those are the circuit and conductors

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.429 
and those are the circuit and conductors
and<00:01:33.320> by<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.659> output<00:01:36.869> search

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and by the way this is the output search

avenue<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.439> nice<00:02:04.619> touch<00:02:04.920> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
avenue here it's really nice touch this

avenue here it's really nice touch this
is<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.689> thick<00:02:06.960> plastic<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.340> guy<00:02:08.489> who

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
is a really thick plastic the guy who

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
is a really thick plastic the guy who
built<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.479> claim<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.410> actually

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
built this claim is you can actually

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.860 
built this claim is you can actually
stand<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.310> no<00:02:11.730> doubt

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
stand on this no doubt

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.199 
stand on this no doubt
think<00:02:13.080> here<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.560> industrial<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.000> real

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
think here is like industrial and real
