the way that it's set up is going to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.230 
the way that it's set up is going to
perform<00:00:22.110> best<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.160> spring<00:00:23.520> as<00:00:23.730> well<00:00:24.119> in

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
liner into it now I would say that you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.430 
liner into it now I would say that you
could<00:00:48.179> probably<00:00:48.480> stretch<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.019> pretty<00:00:49.230> far

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
could probably stretch it pretty far

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.660 
could probably stretch it pretty far
