00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.519
 inns 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.789
 I have chickens and this one has a port with tomatoes I want tomato if 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.460
 you have some 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.579
 an exchange 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.579
 a simple exchange for example the new one for each take 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.539
 that's how things were at the beginning 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.769
 but of course sometimes their tomatoes were better and others worse 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.529
 or maybe I want to buy a horse and I was very clear about how many eggs 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.669
 I need 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.429
 but if we are as a reference for example is a simple example a bit of 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.150
 all 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.950
 brunito 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.420
 and there is not too much is valuable 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.420
 so we can do a conversion batch 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.140
 if a dozen eggs are worth the same as a gold nugget and a horse 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.660
 it costs without seeds, easy to know that a horse is worth the same as me 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.810
 that if it is not approved 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.360
 simple truth 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.530
 gold thus becomes a bargaining chip 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 to simplify 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.200
 you can not buy a horse we also guide ourselves by coins 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.440
 missing a goal in favor 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.260
 efe 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.110
 he touches him 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.930
 that is the first case 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.080
 that is more or less the same as the principles 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 except that now we need gold to buy things that are not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 peche meats 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.980
 is the person who invented the system has an establishment 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
 a place where what we have was stored 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.990
 the man uses them clearly 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.290
 They do not want to give us the gold of coarse lend it to us 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.420
 for example, it generates 10 coins 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 thanks to the loan for a period of 12 months 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.379
 only asks for a reasonable interest logical put quinín 10% 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.779
 yes the goodbye to his roll did not risk anything 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.840
 so you need a guarantee to cover the possibility that I do not 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.659
 I keep my part of the deal 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.389
 that would be better to hit those knives 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.389
 they are for juice 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.589
 in his case like that he also wants gold to mortgage his garden 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.149
 so the man preceded him 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:42.949
 in exchange for their complaints 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.089
 it does not follow with its tomatoes and its green areas 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.149
 the correction process does not have to be undone 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.849
 you only have to return a coffee to the bank after one year, so 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:53.759
 that they lent him 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.129
 women 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.479
 your garden other products and you have a whole year 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.319
 only if he does not meet the bank he stays with four 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.519
 the agreement 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.189
 juanjuí there are problems 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.189
 topless 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.129
 let's imagine that the bank owns a total amount of delinquent debt 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.469
 is the total amount of gold that exists 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.369
 not one more 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.379
 besides the good man we exist other 10 people 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.359
 p 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.039
 a blacksmith or maybe a couple of ranchers 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.039
 a seamstress 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.039
 ten people in total 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.519
 we all need gold to buy titles we have asked for a loan 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.329
 10 coins for each 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.329
 a total of 100 megabytes 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.569
 the banker has given us all his savings 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.659
 with absolute generosity 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.020
 a simple 10% 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.020
 one coin per person 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.430
 But that is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.259
 According to Pythagoras we have a problem 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.349
 if after twelve months we have to pay 11 coins each 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.520
 while we are going to take out 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.470
 ponce coins each are 110 coins that means there are 10 coins in 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.220
 interests 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.370
 that they will never be able to stop 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.370
 whatever happens 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.960
 no problem 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.629
 the bank was invented to make things easier to complicate 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.830
 It is a reasonable solution 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 remind me only interest one coin every second 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.749
 next year 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.749
 You will return the initially loaned amount 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.949
 the first 10 coins in short 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.169
 but nevertheless 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.409
 however if we return a coin we will have nine 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.089
 the truth to 1 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:29.379
 so if still 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.900
 we must foot coins 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.900
 One year later we will continue with the same problem and in addition 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.650
 we will have less money 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.740
 some coins less than the previous year 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.250
 if we repeat the operation for ten years and that whenever they let us pass 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.039
 only the interest 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.100
 at that time 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.029
 we are left with nothing 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.210
 all the money disappeared 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.370
 however we will continue to have 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.479
 in this province 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.360
 the bank will have recovered all the gold 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.580
 we will not have anything 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.229
 and we will still owe what they lent us the beginning 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.009
 time that passes between all that we can never return because simply 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.599
 so we will have the lands 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.460
 the animals the food we mortgage as collateral the principle 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.240
 ten years ago 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.100
 in ten years the bank will have what it had at the beginning plus all our 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.119
 possessions 

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:29.960
 we will not have anything 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.479
 absolutely nothing 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:32.869
 with what practice 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:35.869
 we will have become slaves of the bank 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:39.739
 and for nothing
