gems<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.260> about<00:00:49.500> efficiency<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.180> side

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
gems is all about efficiency so one side

you've got two commodities you've got
time<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.059> build<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.079> you're<00:00:55.230> gonna<00:00:55.320> licks

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
time to build and you're gonna licks

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
time to build and you're gonna licks
here<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> minimize<00:00:56.760> those<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
here and you want to minimize those as

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.930 
here and you want to minimize those as
much<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> possibly<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.670> on<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> other

much as you possibly can on the other
side<00:01:00.090> you've<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> resources<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.500> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
side you've got the resources so you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.229 
side you've got the resources so you
wanna<00:01:01.710> maximize<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.489> amount<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.789> gold<00:01:03.090> or

elixir that you're getting
usually<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.650> gold<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
usually it's gold because you can you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.719 
usually it's gold because you can you
can<00:01:06.119> build<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.780> coal<00:01:07.670> there's<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
can build more with coal there's a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.210 
can build more with coal there's a
couple<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> treats<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.540> use<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.020> our

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
double use to troops and a couple that

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.890 
double use to troops and a couple that
are<00:01:13.470> pretty<00:01:13.740> specialized<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.330> double<00:01:15.750> use

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
are pretty specialized so double use

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.499 
are pretty specialized so double use

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
secondly of course they go directly for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
secondly of course they go directly for
defenses<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.930> target<00:01:58.530> them

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
defenses so you want to target them

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
defenses so you want to target them
where<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> where<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.270> tarts<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
where the where the more tarts and the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.649 
where the where the more tarts and the
wizards<00:02:01.170> house<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.590> first<00:02:02.420> take<00:02:03.420> into

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
wizards house are first take into

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.389 
wizards house are first take into
account<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> wall<00:02:04.229> breakers<00:02:04.590> right<00:02:04.799> wall

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
account the wall breakers right wall

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.000 
account the wall breakers right wall
breakers<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.850> very<00:02:06.090> specialists<00:02:06.600> true

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
breakers are very specialists true

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.210 
breakers are very specialists true
Houston<00:02:07.850> has<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.119> play<00:02:08.270> calls<00:02:09.130> Lemmy<00:02:10.130> has

Houston has to play calls Lemmy has

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.970 
Houston has to play calls Lemmy has
great<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.210> was<00:02:11.600> behaving<00:02:11.840> like<00:02:12.590> playing<00:02:12.860> hate

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
great I was behaving like playing hate

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.150 
great I was behaving like playing hate
it<00:02:13.390> I'm<00:02:14.390> also<00:02:14.570> farmer<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.530> family<00:02:16.010> has<00:02:16.130> a

it I'm also farmer I so family has a

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.470 
it I'm also farmer I so family has a
great<00:02:16.340> video<00:02:16.610> about<00:02:16.640> how<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.940> use<00:02:17.300> wall

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
great video about how to use wall

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.110 
great video about how to use wall
breakers<00:02:17.870> really<00:02:18.260> well<00:02:18.490> buggies<00:02:19.520> everyone

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
breakers really well buggies everyone

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.160 
breakers really well buggies everyone
knows<00:02:20.240> your<00:02:20.390> family<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.780> right

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
knows your family is right

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.080 
knows your family is right
but<00:02:21.800> basically<00:02:22.010> wall<00:02:22.430> breakers<00:02:22.760> attack

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
but basically wall breakers attack

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.500 
but basically wall breakers attack
buildings<00:02:23.920> they<00:02:24.920> go<00:02:25.100> for<00:02:25.280> them<00:02:25.400> they<00:02:25.670> they're

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
buildings they go for them they they're

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.670 
buildings they go for them they they're
trying<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.870> go<00:02:26.960> for<00:02:27.140> buildings<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.620> are

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
trying to go for buildings that are

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.530 
trying to go for buildings that are
enclosed<00:02:28.070> fully<00:02:28.280> by<00:02:28.430> winds<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.090> they<00:02:29.180> explode

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
enclosed fully by winds and they explode

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.910 
enclosed fully by winds and they explode
on<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.750> wall<00:02:29.960> it's<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.560> best<00:02:30.740> way<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
on the wall it's the best way to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.620 
on the wall it's the best way to
remember<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:32.000> try<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.330> get<00:02:32.420> them<00:02:32.540> at

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
remember it to try and get them at

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.240 
remember it to try and get them at
intersections<00:02:33.320> if<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.800> because<00:02:34.040> then<00:02:34.160> I

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
intersections if you can because then I

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.250 
intersections if you can because then I
get<00:02:34.400> two<00:02:34.610> sections<00:02:35.030> at<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.180> same<00:02:35.390> time<00:02:35.600> so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
get two sections at the same time so

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.870 
get two sections at the same time so
whilst<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.710> Giants<00:02:37.130> are<00:02:37.250> approaching<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
whilst the Giants are approaching the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.600 
whilst the Giants are approaching the
defensive<00:02:38.540> structures<00:02:39.440> they<00:02:40.040> wall<00:02:40.280> breakers

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
defensive structures they wall breakers

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.730 
defensive structures they wall breakers
can<00:02:40.730> go<00:02:40.850> straight<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.570> pop<00:02:42.230> open<00:02:42.410> those

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
can go straight in and pop open those

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.280 
can go straight in and pop open those
walls<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.370> hopefully<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.270> Giants<00:02:44.630> have<00:02:44.720> get

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
walls and hopefully the Giants have get

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.090 
walls and hopefully the Giants have get
a<00:02:45.320> free<00:02:45.530> rein<00:02:45.740> in<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.740> course<00:02:48.770> it's<00:02:49.070> a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
a free rein in and then of course it's a

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.980 
a free rein in and then of course it's a
goblins<00:02:49.460> right<00:02:49.910> goblins<00:02:50.330> are<00:02:50.450> there<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.780> steal

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
goblins right goblins are there to steal

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.340 
goblins right goblins are there to steal
steal<00:02:51.410> gold<00:02:51.620> or<00:02:51.860> Alexia<00:02:52.400> nothing<00:02:52.700> else<00:02:53.350> that's

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
steal gold or Alexia nothing else that's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.760 
steal gold or Alexia nothing else that's
it<00:02:54.560> really<00:02:54.710> so<00:02:55.220> very<00:02:55.250> basic<00:02:55.730> army<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.680> we

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
it really so very basic army and we

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.900 
it really so very basic army and we
going<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.950> go<00:02:58.010> right<00:02:58.250> now

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
going to go right now

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.400 
going to go right now
yes<00:02:59.390> I'm<00:02:59.660> attacking<00:03:00.580> bases<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:02.410> poorer

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
yes I'm attacking bases that have poorer

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.130 
yes I'm attacking bases that have poorer
defenses<00:03:03.950> than<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.510> that's<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.630> whole<00:03:05.750> idea<00:03:05.780> of

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
defenses than I that's the whole idea of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.890 
defenses than I that's the whole idea of
farming<00:03:06.560> right<00:03:09.070> big<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.880> clever<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> way

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
farming right big so clever it's the way

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.920 
farming right big so clever it's the way
it<00:03:12.020> works<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.770> every<00:03:13.130> base<00:03:13.370> has<00:03:13.700> flaws<00:03:14.060> there's

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
it works so every base has flaws there's

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.720 
it works so every base has flaws there's
no<00:03:15.110> perfect<00:03:15.470> base<00:03:15.860> it's<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.160> beauty<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.580> this

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
no perfect base it's a beauty of this

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.970 
no perfect base it's a beauty of this
game<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.570> can't<00:03:17.870> create<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.290> perfect<00:03:18.680> base<00:03:18.800> so

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
game you can't create a perfect base so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.140 
game you can't create a perfect base so
here<00:03:19.130> we<00:03:19.220> go<00:03:19.340> hundred<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.760> thirty<00:03:19.940> five

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
here we go hundred and thirty five

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.180 
here we go hundred and thirty five
thousand<00:03:20.600> gold<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.410> where<00:03:21.620> are<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.770> mortars

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
thousand gold so where are the mortars

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.640 
thousand gold so where are the mortars
learn<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.060> triangle<00:03:23.510> that's<00:03:23.660> good<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
learn the triangle that's good the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.800 
learn the triangle that's good the
archers<00:03:24.950> out<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.640> rooster<00:03:26.420> tails<00:03:26.660> are

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
archers out and so the rooster tails are

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.530 
archers out and so the rooster tails are
there<00:03:26.989> now<00:03:27.620> we<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.550> get<00:03:28.730> good<00:03:28.910> access<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
there now we can get good access to the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.900 
there now we can get good access to the
more<00:03:29.720> target<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.709> close<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.310> good<00:03:31.430> access<00:03:31.730> and

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
more target to close and good access and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.460 
more target to close and good access and
water<00:03:32.090> there<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.500> I'm<00:03:33.680> going<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:33.910> pop<00:03:34.910> open

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
water there so I'm going to pop open

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.430 
water there so I'm going to pop open
that<00:03:36.470> wall<00:03:36.709> there<00:03:38.709> doesn't<00:03:39.709> matter<00:03:40.630> okay<00:03:41.630> I'm

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
that wall there doesn't matter okay I'm

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.509 
that wall there doesn't matter okay I'm
going<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.620> take<00:03:42.800> out<00:03:42.980> these<00:03:43.130> outlying

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
going to take out these outlying

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.660 
going to take out these outlying
buildings<00:03:43.790> here<00:03:44.920> I'm<00:03:45.920> going<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.160> throw<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.580> the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
buildings here I'm going to throw in the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.670 
buildings here I'm going to throw in the
meat<00:03:46.790> shield<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:48.140> see<00:03:48.380> where<00:03:48.560> these

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
meat shield and you see where these

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.910 
meat shield and you see where these
intersections<00:03:49.550> are<00:03:50.500> let's<00:03:51.500> see<00:03:51.650> if<00:03:51.709> we<00:03:51.800> can

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
intersections are let's see if we can

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.360 
intersections are let's see if we can
get<00:03:52.070> them<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:53.330> intersections<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:55.130> I<00:03:55.220> could

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
get them in the intersections so I could

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.860 
get them in the intersections so I could
pop<00:03:55.580> open<00:03:55.760> two<00:03:56.120> walls<00:03:56.330> at<00:03:56.510> once

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.300 

okay<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.230> I've<00:04:02.320> got<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> defensive<00:04:03.010> arches

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
okay so I've got the defensive arches

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.850 
okay so I've got the defensive arches
coming<00:04:03.610> in<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:04.060> I'm<00:04:04.960> gonna<00:04:05.080> counter<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.710> with

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
coming in so I'm gonna counter that with

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.790 
coming in so I'm gonna counter that with
my<00:04:06.040> arches<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.900> we've<00:04:10.990> got<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.200> mortar<00:04:11.530> there

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
my arches so we've got that mortar there

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.620 
my arches so we've got that mortar there
we've<00:04:12.550> got<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.790> taking<00:04:13.060> out<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.270> Mort<00:04:13.450> are

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
we've got the taking out that Mort are

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.699 
we've got the taking out that Mort are
there<00:04:15.900> wizard<00:04:16.900> tower<00:04:17.140> there<00:04:17.350> which<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.590> about

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
there wizard tower there which is about

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.490 
there wizard tower there which is about
to<00:04:17.980> die<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:19.150> save<00:04:19.480> that<00:04:19.630> last<00:04:19.810> giant<00:04:20.320> for

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
to die and you save that last giant for

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.260 
to die and you save that last giant for
that<00:04:20.590> last<00:04:20.799> water<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.500> try<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.160> target<00:04:24.850> first

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
that last water so try to target first

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.650 
that last water so try to target first
the<00:04:25.510> defense's<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.080> course<00:04:27.390> know<00:04:28.390> that<00:04:28.420> I've

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
the defense's of course know that I've

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.630 
the defense's of course know that I've
got<00:04:28.780> four<00:04:29.140> wall<00:04:29.410> breakers<00:04:29.770> left<00:04:29.980> so<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.370> stands

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
got four wall breakers left so it stands

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.480 
got four wall breakers left so it stands
up<00:04:30.790> seems<00:04:31.750> like<00:04:31.900> was<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.350> Tesla<00:04:33.160> there<00:04:33.340> is

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
up seems like was that Tesla there is

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.140 
up seems like was that Tesla there is
gone<00:04:33.840> I'm<00:04:34.840> going<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.080> go<00:04:35.200> in<00:04:35.320> deeper<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.970> what

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
gone I'm going to go in deeper so what

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.640 
gone I'm going to go in deeper so what
he<00:04:37.300> had<00:04:37.390> done<00:04:37.540> you<00:04:37.960> need<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.140> get<00:04:38.320> that<00:04:38.410> more

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
he had done you need to get that more

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.610 
he had done you need to get that more
top<00:04:41.010> okay<00:04:42.720> right<00:04:43.720> in<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.080> case<00:04:44.290> I'm<00:04:44.440> going<00:04:44.560> to

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
top okay right in this case I'm going to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.830 
top okay right in this case I'm going to
use<00:04:44.680> my<00:04:44.980> burger<00:04:45.490> king<00:04:45.820> as<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.180> way<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.360> soak<00:04:46.660> up

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
use my burger king as a way to soak up

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.360 
use my burger king as a way to soak up
the<00:04:46.990> defense's<00:04:47.470> because<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.830> need<00:04:47.980> to<00:04:48.070> get<00:04:48.220> in

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
the defense's because I need to get in

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.620 
the defense's because I need to get in
there<00:04:48.610> if<00:04:48.730> I<00:04:48.850> possibly<00:04:49.180> can<00:04:50.040> there<00:04:51.040> we<00:04:51.100> go<00:04:51.630> see

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
there if I possibly can there we go see

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.110 
there if I possibly can there we go see
those<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.710> whilst<00:04:53.980> that's<00:04:54.460> soaking<00:04:54.910> up<00:04:54.970> the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
those so whilst that's soaking up the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.360 
those so whilst that's soaking up the
that's<00:04:55.510> taking<00:04:55.810> at<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.960> attack<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:57.540> can<00:04:59.340> pop<00:05:00.340> up

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
that's taking at the attack I can pop up

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.230 
that's taking at the attack I can pop up
all<00:05:00.730> open<00:05:01.030> there<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.330> gold<00:05:01.630> they're

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
all open there this gold they're

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.280 
all open there this gold they're
focusing<00:05:04.240> on<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.479> area<00:05:04.540> there<00:05:04.870> I<00:05:04.900> can<00:05:05.110> worry

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
focusing on that area there I can worry

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.130 
focusing on that area there I can worry
about<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:06.430> elixir<00:05:06.970> of<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.390> in<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.630> minute<00:05:07.780> I

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
about that elixir of that in a minute I

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.230 
about that elixir of that in a minute I
really<00:05:09.010> were<00:05:09.220> there's<00:05:09.490> something<00:05:09.910> about<00:05:10.120> this

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
really were there's something about this

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.020 
really were there's something about this
much<00:05:10.419> as<00:05:10.510> I<00:05:10.570> possibly<00:05:10.900> can<00:05:11.610> when<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:12.640> send<00:05:12.910> in

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
much as I possibly can when I send in

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.730 
much as I possibly can when I send in
the<00:05:13.120> goblins<00:05:13.540> I'm<00:05:14.140> gonna<00:05:14.350> send<00:05:14.560> them<00:05:14.650> in

right there just to distract it so the
other<00:05:30.880> ten<00:05:31.090> you<00:05:31.240> really<00:05:31.450> need<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.720> use<00:05:31.840> the

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
other ten you really need to use the

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.190 
other ten you really need to use the
archer<00:05:32.169> Queen<00:05:32.200> there<00:05:32.970> right<00:05:33.970> so<00:05:34.210> what's<00:05:34.810> left

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
basically we've got a lot of the 22,000

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.909 
basically we've got a lot of the 22,000
old<00:05:38.260> in<00:05:38.410> those<00:05:39.660> storages<00:05:40.660> there<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.080> I'm<00:05:41.770> gonna

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
old in those storages there so I'm gonna

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.040 
old in those storages there so I'm gonna
use<00:05:43.620> get<00:05:44.620> in<00:05:44.740> there<00:05:44.919> pop<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.610> one<00:05:45.729> open<00:05:46.050> right

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050

use get in there pop that one open right
so<00:05:47.950> I'm<00:05:48.010> going<00:05:48.130> to<00:05:48.160> use<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.340> dual<00:05:48.640> tap<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.450> try

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
so I'm going to use a dual tap to try

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.659 
so I'm going to use a dual tap to try
and<00:05:49.780> target<00:05:49.990> these<00:05:50.710> at<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:51.190> same<00:05:51.370> time

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.540 

but<00:05:56.669> basically<00:05:56.879> I'm<00:05:57.269> going<00:05:57.719> from<00:05:57.959> both<00:05:58.169> sides

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
but basically I'm going from both sides

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.369 
but basically I'm going from both sides
clear<00:05:59.550> out<00:05:59.729> those<00:05:59.909> the<00:06:00.629> golden<00:06:01.019> left<00:06:01.169> side

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
clear out those the golden left side

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:02.689 
clear out those the golden left side
there<00:06:01.589> clear<00:06:01.949> out<00:06:02.009> the<00:06:02.099> golden<00:06:02.369> looks<00:06:02.519> like

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
there clear out the golden looks like

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.489 
there clear out the golden looks like
there<00:06:02.909> got<00:06:03.239> all<00:06:03.269> the<00:06:03.479> gold<00:06:03.629> I'm<00:06:04.139> not<00:06:04.349> that

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:04.499 
there got all the gold I'm not that
