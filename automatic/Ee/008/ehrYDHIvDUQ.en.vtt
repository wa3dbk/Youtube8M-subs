00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
the thing I love most about ice team is

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.340 
the thing I love most about ice team is
that<00:00:03.270> it's<00:00:03.449> very<00:00:03.629> innovative

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
that it's very innovative

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.960 
that it's very innovative
it's<00:00:04.529> very<00:00:04.740> never<00:00:05.040> extreme<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.549> many

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
it's very never extreme we have many

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.579 
it's very never extreme we have many
different<00:00:06.330> ways<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.480> learning<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.290> see

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
different ways of learning and I see

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.970 
different ways of learning and I see
we're<00:00:07.830> not<00:00:07.980> regular<00:00:08.970> students<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.780> think

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
we're not regular students and I think

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.890 
we're not regular students and I think
we're<00:00:10.980> advanced<00:00:11.340> because<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.090> things

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
we're advanced because we do things

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.660 
we're advanced because we do things
eventually<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.769> advanced<00:00:14.130> learning<00:00:14.429> we

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
eventually we have advanced learning we

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.320 
eventually we have advanced learning we
have<00:00:14.700> projects<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.680> incorporate<00:00:16.680> our
