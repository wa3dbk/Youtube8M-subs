00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.990
 ok so we find ourselves one more time on the menu and I'm going to change a map 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.519
 I write in advance on minecraft 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.320
 with a strong foehn gesture 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.320
 I am a beautiful accent 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 on time so the scene really wait 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.810
 flippantly 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.040
 I found a pretty good surface 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.040
 to put my structure 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 so if we put it on the back I do not think it poses a problem 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.530
 Paul Berenger 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.670
 for some it is necessary to create oneself 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.150
 so how to create a surface 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.020
 it is simply enough 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.989
 d is the surface you need and replace it for example 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.750
 he does not forget death is better it is on the spot 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 so then their function stupidity a port 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 we take the son and we knew how to keep 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 hence the collar 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.250
 it can also be given a small rotation in 1960 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.010
 they invade the net 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.700
 a port 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 so we do not forget saved and we see immediately went to see what it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 surely gives a strike 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.710
 do we need to find ourselves at the menu the thresholds of safeguarding in grace 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.280
 so without further ado I will fix the backup what I just changed 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
 joachim kühn and we will be able to observe the result 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.620
 so like the first sputnik and right in front of the statue will not even play 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.060
 need to move I know that pile pile well placed 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 so as I see a small budget 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.689
 so except lying and certainly mickeys 11 minutes they kill us all 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.329
 ages can actually strike 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.370
 I do a small editing for star title loca suite to avoid me 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.369
 do a second part so for the future of the boiling is good 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 ibm option deals with the structure that I write 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.049
 so we let everything change nothing 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 top 8 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.759
 and so that's the structure I did it was quickly 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.819
 with the sublime house of cripure I do not know I found on a year 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.229
 a waiter 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.169
 conquering swedish who is really pretty friendly taxes the time that 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.579
 I spent on it 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 do not miss anymore centered head 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.699
 but the front it's been a year 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.959
 so if you can make a donation I wanted to show a pixel study 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.799
 art of giving 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.989
 double concert the hand is so pollute cover your lap a 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.519
 Fourvière hill 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.700
 a shuddering wisdom indebted which we doubt that you early 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.739
 so we're going on it's crying cries and hi to all
