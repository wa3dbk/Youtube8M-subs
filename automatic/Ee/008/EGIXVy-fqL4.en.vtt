00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.400 

some<00:00:08.340> days<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.849> find<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> fish<00:00:09.750> are<00:00:09.929> deep<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
some days I find the fish are deep and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.620 
some days I find the fish are deep and
they're<00:00:10.800> all<00:00:10.980> stacked<00:00:11.370> up<00:00:11.610> tight<00:00:12.000> together<00:00:12.210> in

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
they're all stacked up tight together in

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.110 
they're all stacked up tight together in
that<00:00:13.170> type<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.590> situation<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.969> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
that type of a situation I like to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.599 
that type of a situation I like to
attack<00:00:15.450> those<00:00:15.660> fish<00:00:15.960> with<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> spoon<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
attack those fish with a spoon it's a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.080 
attack those fish with a spoon it's a
very<00:00:17.940> easy<00:00:18.270> technique<00:00:18.770> generally<00:00:19.770> I'll<00:00:20.279> find

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
very easy technique generally I'll find

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.939 
very easy technique generally I'll find
those<00:00:21.270> fish<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.689> my<00:00:21.810> electronics<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.619> then

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
those fish with my electronics and then

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.529 
those fish with my electronics and then
I'll<00:00:23.100> put<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.310> bow<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:23.880> boat<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:24.480> over

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I'll put the bow of my boat right over

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.990 
I'll put the bow of my boat right over
the<00:00:24.869> top<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.109> those<00:00:25.320> fish<00:00:25.590> I'll<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:26.580> let<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the top of those fish I'll then let this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.929 
the top of those fish I'll then let this
this<00:00:27.869> spoon<00:00:28.230> fall<00:00:28.769> straight<00:00:29.220> down<00:00:29.369> through

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
this spoon fall straight down through

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.020 
this spoon fall straight down through
the<00:00:30.029> water<00:00:30.210> right<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.019> top<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> fish<00:00:31.740> at

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
the water right on top of the fish at

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
the water right on top of the fish at
that<00:00:33.030> point<00:00:33.329> I've<00:00:33.570> got<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.170> figure<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that point I've got to figure out with a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.660 
that point I've got to figure out with a
quick<00:00:35.640> lift<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.210> fall<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> slow<00:00:38.340> lift

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
quick lift and fall or with a slow lift

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.319 
quick lift and fall or with a slow lift
or<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> medium<00:00:39.510> speed<00:00:39.750> lift<00:00:40.290> fall<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.489> track

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
or a medium speed lift fall I track

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.240 
or a medium speed lift fall I track
those<00:00:42.570> fish<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.379> I'll<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.890> quick

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
those fish so I'll start with a quick

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.450 
those fish so I'll start with a quick
sharp<00:00:44.910> upward<00:00:45.360> movement<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.039> that<00:00:47.039> spoon<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
sharp upward movement and that spoon is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
sharp upward movement and that spoon is
going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> flutter<00:00:47.879> back<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.390> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
going to flutter back down it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.130 
going to flutter back down it's
important<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.520> follow<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.360> drop<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.989> your

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
important to follow that drop with your

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.439 
important to follow that drop with your
rod<00:00:52.320> tip<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> fish<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.940> generally

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
rod tip because the fish will generally

rod tip because the fish will generally
hit<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.230> spoon<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.039> falling<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> lift

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
hit that spoon as it's falling so I lift

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
hit that spoon as it's falling so I lift
it<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.840> sharply<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.530> follow<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.430> back<00:00:59.609> down<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it up sharply I follow it back down if I

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
it up sharply I follow it back down if I
feel<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:01.079> tip<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.129> feel<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> line

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
