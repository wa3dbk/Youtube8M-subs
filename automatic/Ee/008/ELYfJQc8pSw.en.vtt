00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
not attack it again but will now go out

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.230 
not attack it again but will now go out
to<00:01:24.049> find<00:01:24.320> live<00:01:24.799> trees<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.640> begin<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.060> cycle

again the adults attack a green pine
tree<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:29.990> get<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.680> create<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.040> long

they're<00:02:02.930> going<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.350> turn<00:02:03.560> red<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.420> then<00:02:05.420> after

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
they're going to turn red and then after

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.229 
they're going to turn red and then after
that<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.259> following<00:02:06.680> year<00:02:07.159> they're<00:02:07.820> standing

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
that the following year they're standing

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.569 
that the following year they're standing
dead<00:02:08.450> trees<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.810> are<00:02:09.140> gray<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.739> quite<00:02:10.340> often

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.220 
dead trees and are gray and quite often
on<00:02:10.820> hillsides<00:02:11.360> you'll<00:02:11.660> see<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.019> green

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
on hillsides you'll see the green

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.729 
on hillsides you'll see the green

with the infested trees one of the
things<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.579> can<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.939> is<00:02:38.329> to<00:02:38.599> cut<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.989> trunk

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
things you can do is to cut the trunk

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.140 
things you can do is to cut the trunk
into<00:02:39.829> two<00:02:39.980> foot<00:02:40.189> lengths<00:02:40.549> sometime<00:02:40.969> between

into two foot lengths sometime between

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.690 
into two foot lengths sometime between
mid-september<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.469> the<00:02:42.799> 1st<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.129> March<00:02:43.280> what

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
mid-september and the 1st of March what

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.490 
mid-september and the 1st of March what
will<00:02:43.819> happen<00:02:44.239> is<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.750> piece<00:02:44.989> will<00:02:45.200> dry<00:02:45.469> out

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
will happen is that piece will dry out

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.280 
will happen is that piece will dry out
and<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.609> will<00:02:46.730> kill<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.150> beetles<00:02:47.870> as<00:02:48.049> they

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
and it will kill the beetles as they

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.750 
and it will kill the beetles as they
mature<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.250> if<00:02:50.209> after<00:02:50.870> March<00:02:51.709> 1st<00:02:52.099> say<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
mature and if after March 1st say the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.610 
mature and if after March 1st say the
middle<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.180> May<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.450> can<00:02:53.870> take<00:02:54.109> that<00:02:54.349> piece

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
middle of May you can take that piece

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.729 
middle of May you can take that piece
and<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.489> roll<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.060> once<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.349> underside

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
and just roll it once so the underside

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.280 
and just roll it once so the underside
is<00:02:57.920> now<00:02:58.069> on<00:02:58.280> top<00:02:58.489> you'll<00:02:59.239> have<00:02:59.450> even<00:02:59.959> heating

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
is now on top you'll have even heating

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.960 
is now on top you'll have even heating
and<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.889> can<00:03:01.010> end<00:03:01.159> up<00:03:01.250> killing<00:03:01.519> anywhere

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
and you can end up killing anywhere

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.940 
and you can end up killing anywhere
between<00:03:02.150> 80<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.810> 100<00:03:03.260> percent<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.680> beetles

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
between 80 to 100 percent of the beetles

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.699 
between 80 to 100 percent of the beetles
in<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.250> piece<00:03:05.109> one<00:03:06.109> of<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.260> other<00:03:06.439> ways<00:03:06.680> that

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
in that piece one of the other ways that

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.129 
in that piece one of the other ways that
you<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.489> treat<00:03:07.760> your<00:03:07.939> beetle-infested<00:03:08.419> logs

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
you can treat your beetle-infested logs

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.460 
you can treat your beetle-infested logs
is<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.859> burn<00:03:10.760> them<00:03:10.819> once<00:03:11.389> they're<00:03:11.599> down<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.169> as

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
is to burn them once they're down and as

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.959 
is to burn them once they're down and as
you<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.739> see<00:03:12.799> here<00:03:13.280> we<00:03:13.459> don't<00:03:13.639> need<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.819> turn

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
you can see here we don't need to turn

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.580 
you can see here we don't need to turn
them<00:03:14.120> into<00:03:14.269> ashes<00:03:14.750> just<00:03:14.780> heat<00:03:15.139> them<00:03:15.230> up<00:03:15.379> good

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
them into ashes just heat them up good

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.700 
them into ashes just heat them up good
to<00:03:15.739> kill<00:03:15.919> the<00:03:16.069> beetles<00:03:16.340> underneath
