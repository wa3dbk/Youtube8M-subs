00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.719
 and yes in this fucking video why 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.980
 I speak like that me good in this 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.290
 video you will not see my face you 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.660
 will only see my hand and we will see 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.700
 so some pretty important details 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.070
 who will help you work this 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.200
 little method of scratching the strings at 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.939
 finger with super long phrases that 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.020
 do not stop 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.460
 to start we will talk about the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.380
 nail length you can all to 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.750
 apply this technique with 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.670
 short nails or long nails the goal 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.050
 of the game is that your nails face little 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670
 close to the same length as it should not 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.260
 that when you join you should not 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.600
 has one that exceeds in relation to 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.770
 the other and if you ever have a world 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.910
 longer than the other everything you 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.010
 have to do is move back a little bit 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.350
 finger or make it go over a little bit 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.000
 so that both nails arrive 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.070
 at about the same level 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.510
 this is to prevent you from hanging up 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.770
 on the ropes this you have a nail 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.000
 which exceeds if you and let's talk that the 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.350
 thumb that goes too far 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.570
 when you are going to make a move towards the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.470
 down when it's the nail of the index that 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 is supposed to scratch the ropes 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.229
 it'll hang up 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.070
 and it can be very bad even yes 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.229
 you tear off a world 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
 it happened to me I do not recommend it 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.960
 same thing in the other way it does not take 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.220
 not that your pass index otherwise 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.049
 in the courses up you go 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.850
 hang up and maybe even broke a 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.520
 rope because the treble strings are 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.930
 fragile so the whole purpose of the game is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 whatever the length of your waves 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.170
 finding the right balance for it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.970
 do not hang on the bodies when 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.250
 you make a blow down or a 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.689
 blow up to go further 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.259
 in this story not to hang 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.750
 the ropes 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 we will also give up everything 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.289
 we will have to do is to lean 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.369
 slightly wrist in the direction there 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.659
 when we want to make a move towards 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.399
 the bottom 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.110
 in this way we are almost safe 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.630
 that the thumb is not going to hang up the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.130
 codes and for costs up the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.709
 We will entrust the focus to the other 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.649
 meaning for it to be the thumb that 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.789
 touches the strings and not the index 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.340
 so here again it asks for 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.500
 the training to really have this 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.750
 small wrist rotation that is very 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.420
 practice to help you do all this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.369
 very good though if you apply 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.539
 this little twist of the wrist there is 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.149
 an important thing to do 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.769
 Attention should not too raised the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.119
 wrist when you go scratch the 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.580
 ropes it must be kept 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.370
 relatively close to the strings not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.260
 completely stuck either but little 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.450
 almost in the line of 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.150
 the forearm with the hand is where 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.800
 you will have the best movement the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.599
 better wrist rotation and the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.450
 best sound possible with your guitar 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.950
 speaking of sounds the last 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.959
 detail that must be addressed on this 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.950
 position and this movement is it 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.840
 have to make tweaks 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.970
 do not drag your fingers on 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.360
 the strings because on a chord this has 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.360
 sounded all 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.500
 and it's not going to be 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.700
 hackers 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.880
 from a musical point of view so we're going 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.840
 seek to have a quick dry shot that 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.970
 can hurt your fingers a little 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.470
 at the beginning, but you have to go through 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.730
 to learn the guitar this way 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.890
 there you will have a beautiful sound all 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.880
 the chords you played loudly or not 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.640
 hunger 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.430
 always keep a dry movement 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.990
 and fast and so that concludes 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.760
 this part of the video 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.740
 so I'll see you in the game 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.930
 next can some exercises that 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.460
 you can apply on your guitar 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.840
 or you can also join me 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.850
 on facebook.com to buy four 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.660
 guitars or on twitter.com stache table 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.780
 on acoustic go to the speed that 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.830
 you do not want too fast and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.160
 do you really focus on the 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.140
 movement 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.820
 make sure your wrist is doing the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.800
 correct movement that it is very long 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.050
 your index that misses you do not 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.260
 not hang on the ropes and that it 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.260
 sounds
