backs<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.149> four<00:01:45.509> balloons<00:01:45.840> coming<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
backs it has four balloons coming up to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
backs it has four balloons coming up to
from<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> Northeast<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> Northwest

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
from the Northeast to from the Northwest

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.350 
from the Northeast to from the Northwest
to<00:01:48.630> help<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> archer<00:01:50.790> towers<00:01:51.149> as

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to help take out the archer towers as

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.819 
to help take out the archer towers as
the<00:01:51.540> rest<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> balloons<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> lava

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the rest of the balloons and the lava

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.389 
the rest of the balloons and the lava
lava<00:01:53.700> hounds<00:01:54.149> engage<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.320> air<00:01:55.590> defenses<00:01:56.159> up

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
lava hounds engage the air defenses up

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.149 
lava hounds engage the air defenses up
to<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> north<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.500> basically<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to the north so that is basically a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
to the north so that is basically a
blueprint<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> perfect<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> pull

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
blueprint for the perfect way to pull

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.249 
blueprint for the perfect way to pull
off<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> townhall<00:02:02.189> 9<00:02:02.219> 3<00:02:02.850> star<00:02:03.119> victory<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.960> can

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
off a townhall 9 3 star victory this can

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.789 
off a townhall 9 3 star victory this can
be<00:02:04.439> used<00:02:04.770> against<00:02:05.399> every<00:02:06.270> Town<00:02:06.689> Hall<00:02:06.990> 9<00:02:07.290> base

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
be used against every Town Hall 9 base

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.160 
be used against every Town Hall 9 base
out<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.489> there's<00:02:09.300> no<00:02:09.660> reason<00:02:09.989> why<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
out there there's no reason why you

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.869 
out there there's no reason why you
can't<00:02:10.500> three-star<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> base<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.489> mean<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> only

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
can't three-star a base I mean the only

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.330 
can't three-star a base I mean the only
reason<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.510> don't<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.750> level<00:02:13.080> 2

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
reason is that you don't have level 2

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.300 
reason is that you don't have level 2
lava<00:02:13.700> hounds<00:02:14.030> unlocked<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.709> go

lava hounds unlocked but you can go

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.860 
lava hounds unlocked but you can go
ahead<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.610> deploy<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.879> heroes<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:17.660> the

ahead and deploy your heroes at the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
towards the end of the attack in most

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.339 
towards the end of the attack in most
cases<00:02:19.879> sometimes<00:02:20.599> when<00:02:20.930> you're<00:02:21.050> evaluating

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
cases sometimes when you're evaluating

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.320 
cases sometimes when you're evaluating
the<00:02:21.530> base<00:02:21.709> there<00:02:22.250> might<00:02:22.459> be<00:02:22.550> an<00:02:22.670> easy<00:02:23.000> air

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the base there might be an easy air

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.550 
the base there might be an easy air
defense<00:02:23.629> you<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.840> take<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.500> equation

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
defense you can take out of the equation

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.369 
defense you can take out of the equation
right<00:02:25.220> off<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.489> bat<00:02:25.670> without<00:02:25.819> even<00:02:26.209> using<00:02:26.510> the

right off the bat without even using the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
the end using them in the beginning

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.220 
the end using them in the beginning
instead<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.700> basically<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.720> exactly

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
instead but basically this is exactly

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.350 
instead but basically this is exactly
how<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.549> very<00:02:34.760> simple

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
how you do it it's a very simple

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.990 
how you do it it's a very simple
strategy<00:02:35.720> but<00:02:36.349> as<00:02:36.650> far<00:02:36.980> as<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.459> troops<00:02:37.730> go<00:02:37.970> I

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
strategy but as far as the troops go I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.789 
strategy but as far as the troops go I
mean<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.629> five<00:02:38.870> lava<00:02:39.140> hounds<00:02:39.349> and<00:02:39.500> twenty

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
mean the five lava hounds and twenty

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.400 
mean the five lava hounds and twenty
balloons<00:02:40.129> is<00:02:40.400> easy<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.450> cook<00:02:41.599> up<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.290> you're

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
balloons is easy to cook up but you're

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.600 
balloons is easy to cook up but you're
definitely<00:02:42.590> gonna<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.129> practice<00:02:43.310> a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
definitely gonna have to practice a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.770 
definitely gonna have to practice a
little<00:02:43.700> bit<00:02:43.910> before<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.330> take<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.720> your

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
little bit before you take it to your

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.960 
little bit before you take it to your
clan<00:02:45.080> wars<00:02:45.380> one<00:02:46.010> thing<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.310> do<00:02:46.519> want<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.790> have

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.580 
happen is the lava hounds to die you can
see<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.030> one<00:02:50.239> still<00:02:50.540> alive<00:02:50.660> here<00:02:51.200> because

is<00:03:03.049> going<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.290> have<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> little<00:03:03.650> bit<00:03:03.860> different

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
is going to have a little bit different

is going to have a little bit different
deployment<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.230> troops<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:06.860> let's<00:03:07.430> focus<00:03:07.579> on

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
deployment and troops but let's focus on

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.970 
deployment and troops but let's focus on
this<00:03:07.970> one<00:03:08.180> first<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.930> can<00:03:09.110> identify<00:03:09.349> that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
this one first so you can identify that

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.640 
this one first so you can identify that
the<00:03:10.370> air<00:03:10.640> defense<00:03:11.030> location<00:03:11.780> then<00:03:12.530> you're

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
the air defense location then you're

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.619 
the air defense location then you're
going<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.829> go<00:03:12.980> ahead<00:03:13.129> and<00:03:13.519> elite<00:03:14.030> guide<00:03:14.299> your

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
once again here he makes it look really

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.360 
once again here he makes it look really
easy<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:45.410> fact<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.799> does<00:03:45.919> take<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.160> lot<00:03:46.340> of

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
easy and in fact it does take a lot of

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.890 
easy and in fact it does take a lot of
practice<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:46.819> look<00:03:47.150> at<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:47.359> he<00:03:47.540> only<00:03:47.660> has<00:03:47.870> a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
practice but look at this he only has a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.650 
practice but look at this he only has a
level<00:03:48.230> eight<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.190> believe<00:03:49.400> barbarian<00:03:50.180> King<00:03:50.450> and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
level eight I believe barbarian King and

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.900 
level eight I believe barbarian King and
that's<00:03:51.230> all<00:03:51.470> he<00:03:51.620> has<00:03:51.829> using<00:03:52.220> have<00:03:52.430> his<00:03:52.579> queen

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
that's all he has using have his queen

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.670 
that's all he has using have his queen
up<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.599> it's<00:03:53.720> definitely<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.169> viable<00:03:54.349> strategy

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
up so it's definitely a viable strategy

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.460 
up so it's definitely a viable strategy
even<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.579> your<00:03:55.700> queen<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.209> upgrading<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:57.319> this

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
even if your queen is upgrading so this

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.870 
even if your queen is upgrading so this
is<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:57.769> such<00:03:57.919> a<00:03:57.950> powerful<00:03:58.519> powerful

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
is just such a powerful powerful

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.180 
is just such a powerful powerful
strategy<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.870> I'm<00:04:00.230> sure<00:04:00.440> most<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.859> you<00:04:01.010> know

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
strategy and I'm sure most of you know

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.979 
strategy and I'm sure most of you know
already<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.180> certainly<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.599> game

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
already that it's certainly a game

it's<00:04:07.579> amazing<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:08.419> it<00:04:08.780> isn't<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.109> period<00:04:09.380> of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
it's amazing but it isn't a period of

super cells doing anything about it any

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.250 
super cells doing anything about it any
time<00:04:11.180> soon<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.810> should<00:04:11.959> take<00:04:12.139> advantage

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
time soon so you should take advantage

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
update they they gave the cannons

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.539 
update they they gave the cannons
another<00:04:18.500> level<00:04:18.769> but<00:04:19.010> they<00:04:19.130> didn't<00:04:19.280> give<00:04:19.400> any

levels so you can consider them the prop

I would recommend here one is their

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.500 
I would recommend here one is their
first<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.550> all<00:04:44.670> they're<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.850> little<00:04:45.150> bit<00:04:45.300> too

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
first of all they're a little bit too

first of all they're a little bit too
early<00:04:45.540> at<00:04:46.020> least<00:04:46.230> having<00:04:46.470> three<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:46.980> them<00:04:47.130> it's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
early at least having three of them it's

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.470 
early at least having three of them it's
fine<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.760> have<00:04:48.050> perhaps<00:04:49.050> one<00:04:49.670> but<00:04:50.670> he<00:04:51.330> has

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480
