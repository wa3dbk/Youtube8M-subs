00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
I'd like to just show you a quick way of

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.329 
I'd like to just show you a quick way of
creating<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.330> sun's<00:00:03.720> rays<00:00:04.140> breaking<00:00:05.069> through

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
creating the sun's rays breaking through

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.600 
creating the sun's rays breaking through
cloud<00:00:05.700> using<00:00:06.629> Woolies<00:00:07.109> wonder<00:00:07.680> brush<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.189> have

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
cloud using Woolies wonder brush I have

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.310 
cloud using Woolies wonder brush I have
this<00:00:08.730> painting<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> sky<00:00:09.870> which<00:00:10.170> is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
dramatic enough but I'm thinking it'll

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.539 
dramatic enough but I'm thinking it'll
look<00:00:12.540> even<00:00:12.719> better<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.590> some<00:00:13.830> sun's<00:00:14.190> rays

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
look even better with some sun's rays

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.519 
look even better with some sun's rays
breaking<00:00:15.269> through<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> cloud<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.350> create
