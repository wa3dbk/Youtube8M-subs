00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.420
 very good to all as pedestrians and 

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.150
 copetonas and until seen daily video 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.620
 and I'm here with a game to the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.499
 you have already seen in the title no 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.780
 and well the truth is that I'm 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:15.539
 practically euphoric because yesterday it was 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 a round day so to speak 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.140
 I'll tell you I started when a little black 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.849
 ops that made a lot that played us and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.580
 I told you what I was going to have some 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:27.089
 I left and nothing came out 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.609
 typical games you went 20-0 and this 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.650
 came one killed you and we started the streak 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.480
 fatal that they started killing you a lot 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.950
 and in the end I that ended in you and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.970
 magic you 28-28 5 or something like that then 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 those games in which you die enough 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.400
 for team duel in my opinion and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.470
 is too much and they do not deserve it is not that 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.620
 they are bad islands but we go that I do not 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.020
 would rise to my channel and good after and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.110
 I said come, let's go back to move 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.880
 trace and I put on and I was in it playing and 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.480
 this was one of the first games that 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.430
 I played and then one more double came out without 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.410
 gray or anything like you're seeing 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.690
 the truth is that the game mode 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.950
 many barracks do not know him well so 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.380
 that you will know them but do not do it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.820
 because I preferred to play smooth domain and the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.230
 truth is that the system to respond to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.390
 a child is pretty good but when 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.150
 you already learn the barracks you think 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.120
 I do not rent enough because you have 20 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.550
 starting minutes if they do not take all the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.320
 barracks because there are up to 400 points 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.170
 Well, if they do not take the barracks 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.090
 you have 20 minutes and there's time for me 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 I estimate about five minutes way more or 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.050
 least it can give you time to get you out 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.290
 four modes and I what am I looking for 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.159
 it's the triple I already said it for twitter 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.640
 and on facebook that the other day I think 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.689
 I'm going to try, I'm not promising, but 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 What I promise you is that I'm going to 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.649
 try to take out the triple-a I see it 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.509
 quite complicated at best with a 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.310
 little help to you leads to 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.619
 get it you have to try to do it 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.969
 before whites 2 but it's like that after 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.819
 to take our game and get this 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.950
 piece this piece of this piece of 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.109
 job that you are seeing now follow me 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.989
 playing and the next game I think 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.379
 that was played in bulnes and you will see it and 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.610
 I played with mp7 but I was going for the triple 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:20.329
 no and take me out here is already the first 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.090
 I took a 1 and go for the second and 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.829
 right where they killed with streak of 18 and 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.760
 then I went back to get another streak of 12 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.290
 or something like that 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.690
 I mean maybe I could have tried 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.959
 and get me the triple a but you want 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.810
 it did not bother me a bit and I kept going 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.239
 playing and take me good no longer no 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.010
 it was like this the game followed but good 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.049
 attentive to this square streak I charge 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.310
 one and they start to come out I have to all 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.460
 change of weapon and I take out the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.640
 specialist here very fast 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.630
 leaving very expensive as you can see 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.490
 well what is being said continue 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.970
 playing and think that another fashion in this 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.440
 case it was a fat that was going up because 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.780
 has a pretty funny moment in the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.600
 that to a tank surely you will have 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.940
 seen in some other game where 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.020
 we got the two very good then 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.110
 he was nothing to take it out and he came to his 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.610
 mother and she started screaming at him and just me 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.030
 killed and starts complaining about that 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.790
 I know what and keep playing no and that came out 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.310
 what went well then one more piece 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.890
 incredible and grace was a love to 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.290
 magnum if I had been looking for it 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.870
 enough time looking for it and I stayed 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.210
 19 streak of 21 streak the best that I 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.640
 Say you have to give I always thought 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.530
 he was going to come out in puzzles but he has not 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.220
 left on another map and that yes already the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.880
 you will see 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.610
 I will try to discuss it with one that 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.180
 He also stressed the lama does a lot of 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.720
 promotion stacks imagine that if this 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.980
 video gets a lot of recognition and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.980
 I will try to upload it to these classes 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.990
 name and I will try to upload it the week that 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.430
 next week and if good 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.730
 I will try to promise you to open the week 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.680
 who comes has her life already depends on 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.320
 that of the valuation that is to this 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.840
 piece of double moa that has taken me out and 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.380
 good with more things that I wanted you 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.630
 comment on that the double pass dwelling 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.610
 magnum in a little bit the triple we have 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.040
 tried to get me out is not what I promise 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.900
 but before whites two the dishes that 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.710
 yes I'm going to try and if it takes 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.310
 get and I want to know if yes I was 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.450
 I did 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.760
 agr would have merit, even if it were 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.890
 a triple hand I do not know I want to ask you 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.480
 wants to know your opinion of making me 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:44.450
 a triple map to cr has merit 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.540
 but put on a good weapon I imagine that 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.910
 would be if it is not confrontation that is the eagerness and 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.820
 well here is triple the triple a 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.860
 if the double mode the second love threatens 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.940
 that just kill me 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.830
 I also want you to put me in the 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.590
 comments if you like this all this 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.030
 make stoppages in black and the 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.030
 low only to not be done so 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.770
 monotonous because this video lasted about 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.300
 nine minutes and in rendering and all that 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.730
 Well I want is that it does not give me much 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.840
 time and so that put me in the 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.610
 comments 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.930
 what weapon you want for the triple 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.570
 if I get it and also try to vote 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.370
