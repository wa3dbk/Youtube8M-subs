00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
right way to stretch your quadricep

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.279 
right way to stretch your quadricep
muscle<00:00:14.519> because<00:00:15.150> many<00:00:15.420> people<00:00:15.630> they<00:00:15.990> don't

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
muscle because many people they don't

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.769 
muscle because many people they don't
stretch<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.830> muscle<00:00:16.910> correctly<00:00:17.910> I'll<00:00:18.210> get

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
stretch this muscle correctly I'll get

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.810 
stretch this muscle correctly I'll get
more<00:00:18.960> into<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.740> little<00:00:19.770> bit<00:00:20.039> but

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
more into that in a little bit but

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.060 
more into that in a little bit but
firstly<00:00:21.300> your<00:00:21.449> quadriceps<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.410> composed<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
firstly your quadriceps it's composed of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.849 
firstly your quadriceps it's composed of
four<00:00:23.150> muscles<00:00:24.150> they're<00:00:24.900> pretty<00:00:25.109> much<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.590> your

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
four muscles they're pretty much on your

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.759 
four muscles they're pretty much on your
thigh<00:00:26.099> your<00:00:26.609> thigh<00:00:26.880> bone<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.480> femur<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.650> they

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
thigh your thigh bone your femur so they

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.189 
thigh your thigh bone your femur so they
consist<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.429> vastus<00:00:29.970> medialis<00:00:30.330> vastus

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
consist of your vastus medialis vastus

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.069 
consist of your vastus medialis vastus
lateralis<00:00:31.529> vastus<00:00:31.859> intermedius<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.239> your

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
lateralis vastus intermedius and your

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.709 
lateralis vastus intermedius and your
rectus<00:00:34.410> femoris<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:35.610> come<00:00:35.910> down<00:00:36.120> converge

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
rectus femoris they come down converge

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.900 
rectus femoris they come down converge
on<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.110> quadricep<00:00:37.800> tendon<00:00:37.829> attached<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
on your quadricep tendon attached to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.360 
on your quadricep tendon attached to
your<00:00:39.030> patella<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:39.690> kneecap<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.040> forms

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
your patella or kneecap then that forms

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.910 
your patella or kneecap then that forms
the<00:00:41.610> patellar<00:00:42.180> ligament<00:00:42.649> attaches<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.890> your

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the patellar ligament attaches to your

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000 
the patellar ligament attaches to your
tibia<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:46.110> quadriceps<00:00:46.770> are

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
tibia so you can see the quadriceps are

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
tibia so you can see the quadriceps are
well<00:00:47.219> positioned<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> extend<00:00:48.899> your<00:00:49.020> knee<00:00:49.200> they

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
well positioned to extend your knee they

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
well positioned to extend your knee they
give<00:00:49.620> me<00:00:49.770> extension<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> those<00:00:51.360> four

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
give me extension but one of those four

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
give me extension but one of those four
muscles<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.829> rectus<00:00:52.860> femoris<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.910> also

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
muscles the rectus femoris it also

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
muscles the rectus femoris it also
attaches<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.500> hip<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.340> rectus

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
attaches to your hip so your rectus

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
attaches to your hip so your rectus
femoris<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.449> only<00:00:57.750> does<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.260> knee

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
femoris not only does it do knee

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.819 
femoris not only does it do knee
extension<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> also<00:01:00.719> does<00:01:01.109> hip<00:01:01.530> flexion

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
extension but it also does hip flexion

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.270 
extension but it also does hip flexion
right<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.470> rectus<00:01:04.769> femoris<00:01:05.010> muscle

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
right here so the rectus femoris muscle

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
right here so the rectus femoris muscle
it's<00:01:05.670> commonly<00:01:06.180> neglected<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:07.650> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it's commonly neglected and when this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
it's commonly neglected and when this
muscle<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.250> neglected<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.659> tight<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
muscle is neglected it can get tight and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
muscle is neglected it can get tight and
so<00:01:10.799> since<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> attaches<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:11.939> pelvis<00:01:12.479> if

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
so since it attaches to your pelvis if

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.480 
so since it attaches to your pelvis if
this<00:01:12.990> muscle<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.470> tight<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.130> tilt<00:01:14.340> your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this muscle is tight it can tilt your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.880 
this muscle is tight it can tilt your
pelvis<00:01:14.549> forward<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.590> helps

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
pelvis forward and then when your helps

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.310 
pelvis forward and then when your helps
to<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.250> tilted<00:01:17.700> forward<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.299> drags<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.960> spine

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to is tilted forward it drags your spine

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.140 
to is tilted forward it drags your spine
along<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.820> creates

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
along with it and that creates

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.330 
along with it and that creates
compression<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.530> lower<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:23.009> right

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
compression and your lower back right

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
compression and your lower back right
here<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.330> causes<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.990> pain<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.590> if

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
here and that causes back pain and if

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
here and that causes back pain and if
that<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.159> also<00:01:26.340> cause<00:01:26.610> knee<00:01:26.880> pain<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.420> by<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that can also cause knee pain to by the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
that can also cause knee pain to by the
way<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.320> your<00:01:28.560> rectus<00:01:28.860> femoris<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
way because your your rectus femoris is

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
way because your your rectus femoris is
really<00:01:29.700> tight<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.210> cause<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.750> knee<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
really tight it can cause your knee to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
really tight it can cause your knee to
mailtraq<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.430> knee<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:33.030> kneecap

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
mailtraq because your knee your kneecap

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
mailtraq because your knee your kneecap
it's<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> train<00:01:34.650> traveling<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.610> down

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
it's like a train traveling up and down

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.030 
it's like a train traveling up and down
the<00:01:35.850> tracks<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.259> femur<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:37.920> your

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the tracks of your femur when your

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
the tracks of your femur when your
rectus<00:01:38.340> femoris<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.759> very<00:01:39.030> tight<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.720> not

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
rectus femoris is very tight it's not

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.109 
rectus femoris is very tight it's not
going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.320> gliding<00:01:40.560> properly<00:01:41.369> along<00:01:41.939> its

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
going to be gliding properly along its

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.780 
going to be gliding properly along its
path<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.960> lead<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.439> knee<00:01:44.159> pain<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
path and that can lead to knee pain and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.060 
path and that can lead to knee pain and
the<00:01:45.210> long<00:01:45.420> run<00:01:45.659> cartilage<00:01:46.290> break<00:01:46.530> down<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the long run cartilage break down and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
the long run cartilage break down and
even<00:01:47.479> osteoarthritis<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:48.990> want

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
even osteoarthritis but you don't want

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.010 
even osteoarthritis but you don't want
so<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.369> are<00:01:50.850> doing<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:51.659> like

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
so if you are doing something like

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.200 
so if you are doing something like
bending<00:01:52.619> forward<00:01:52.950> while<00:01:53.520> stretching<00:01:53.820> your

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
bending forward while stretching your

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
bending forward while stretching your
rectus<00:01:54.600> femoris<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.560> bending
