 put the shit bin within reach of the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 frying pan 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.290
 so you get faster and without spilling 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.290
 filter can live 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.449
 all right 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.670
 try for an optimal result like this 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.860
 often possible in between baking

 filter seemed to be right 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.509
 preferably every 15 to 20 minutes so that it 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.770
 crime already removed calls for it 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.770
 burns and is weak

 always be careful with it 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.520
 remove the filter 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.520
 this is very hot 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.710
 prefer to work with heat-resistant 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.710
 safety gloves 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880
 and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.190
 use the accompanying scraper to the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.360
 larger remains of baking products 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.360
 to remove from the filter 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.160
 to know 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.620
 then release the filter who quietly 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.620
 lower the pan 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.790

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.870
 also 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.090
 I 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.890
 care book on the no leftovers and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.650
 safety more near the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.950
 properties on this forms the lifespan for 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.950
 ted 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.470
 the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.530
 a 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.530
 I 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.450
 get the filter at the end of the day 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 by the rinsing machine on dishwasher 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.860
 reservation of filter and quality 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.690
 before it gives 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.050
 then leave it immediately in the fat 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.940
 that he is not forgotten to use 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.709
 note that the filter must always be dry 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.709
 before you hit him jet
