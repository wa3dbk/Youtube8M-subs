in<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.750> little<00:00:01.020> tutorial<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.709> to

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
in this little tutorial we're going to

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.249 
in this little tutorial we're going to
quickly<00:00:02.250> go<00:00:02.610> through<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:03.060> use<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.959> tool

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
quickly go through and use of a tool

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.530 
quickly go through and use of a tool
called<00:00:04.560> conform<00:00:05.220> tool<00:00:05.520> in<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.790> alias<00:00:06.120> Studio

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
called conform tool in the alias Studio

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.290 
called conform tool in the alias Studio
product<00:00:07.259> it's<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> great<00:00:08.309> tool<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.610> allow<00:00:09.240> you

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
product it's a great tool to allow you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.379 
product it's a great tool to allow you
to<00:00:09.830> define<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> design<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:11.880> something<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
to define a design for something and

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.270 
to define a design for something and
then<00:00:12.570> reuse<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.110> design<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.950> different

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
then reuse that design in different

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.820 
then reuse that design in different
locations<00:00:14.780> conforming<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.440> shape<00:00:16.650> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
locations conforming it to the shape of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.820 
locations conforming it to the shape of
another<00:00:17.100> another<00:00:17.640> shape<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.750> we're<00:00:19.740> gonna

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
another another shape so we're gonna

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.330 
another another shape so we're gonna
start<00:00:20.160> by<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.150> ahead<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.720> grabbing

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
start by just going ahead and grabbing

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.720 
start by just going ahead and grabbing
this<00:00:23.340> particular<00:00:23.820> node<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.359> here<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.730> so

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
this particular node right here and so

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.759 
this particular node right here and so
we're<00:00:26.939> we're<00:00:27.539> told<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.199> that's<00:00:28.410> gonna<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.619> our

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
we're we're told so that's gonna be our

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
we're we're told so that's gonna be our
target<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:29.460> we're<00:00:29.609> gonna<00:00:29.730> tell<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
target and then we're gonna tell it to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.799 
target and then we're gonna tell it to
go<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.679> particular<00:00:32.250> halt<00:00:32.640> piece<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
go on this particular halt piece of the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.670 
go on this particular halt piece of the
whole<00:00:33.960> segment<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.520> surface<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
whole segment here on that surface so we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.369 
whole segment here on that surface so we
will<00:00:38.010> accept<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.670> location<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.750> what's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
will accept that location and what's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.020 
will accept that location and what's
great<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.860> tool<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> automatically

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
great about the tool is it automatically

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.350 
great about the tool is it automatically
will<00:00:42.360> take<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.370> object<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.550> allow<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
will take that object and allow you to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.540 
will take that object and allow you to
position<00:00:45.809> them<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.559> we're<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:46.980> into

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
position them so we're going to go into

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
position them so we're going to go into
the<00:00:47.640> side<00:00:47.910> view<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.510> product<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.350> where

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the side view of the product and where

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860 
the side view of the product and where
we<00:00:50.340> want<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.329> down<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we want this is kind of down in this

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.490 
we want this is kind of down in this
particular<00:00:52.110> section<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:54.199> whole<00:00:55.199> shape

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
particular section of the whole shape

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.400 
particular section of the whole shape
itself<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> point<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.840> time<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
itself at this point in time in the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.819 
itself at this point in time in the
design<00:00:59.000> we're<00:01:00.000> still<00:01:00.539> trying<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> figure<00:01:01.649> out

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
design we're still trying to figure out

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.100 
design we're still trying to figure out
exactly<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.000> overall<00:01:03.420> shape<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.840> going

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
exactly what the overall shape is going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.679 
exactly what the overall shape is going
to<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.119> specific

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to be and so we don't have specific

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.690 
to be and so we don't have specific
locations<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.439> put<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.580> you'll

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
locations to put this but if you'll

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600 
locations to put this but if you'll
notice<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.750> move<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.530> shape<00:01:10.860> around<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
notice when I move this shape around it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810 
notice when I move this shape around it
is<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.510> conforming<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:14.010> holes<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is actually conforming to the holes the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.030 
is actually conforming to the holes the
surface<00:01:15.210> itself<00:01:15.979> which<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.159> awesome<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.150> just

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
surface itself which is awesome it just

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.310 
surface itself which is awesome it just
sort<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.189> glue<00:01:21.000> sticks<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.140> surface

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
sort of like glue sticks to the surface

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.370 
sort of like glue sticks to the surface
itself<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:23.939> gonna<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.570> ahead<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.780> put

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
itself so I'm gonna go ahead and put

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.039 
itself so I'm gonna go ahead and put
this<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.670> particular<00:01:26.880> location<00:01:27.180> right

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
this into this particular location right

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.140 
this into this particular location right
here<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.130> good<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> notice<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
here which is good and you notice that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.270 
here which is good and you notice that
the<00:01:30.329> shape<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:30.869> instead<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> being<00:01:31.590> flat<00:01:31.829> like

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the shape now instead of being flat like

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
the shape now instead of being flat like
the<00:01:32.460> original<00:01:32.880> ones<00:01:33.060> there's<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the original ones there's actually this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760 
the original ones there's actually this
nice<00:01:34.619> curve<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.540> exactly<00:01:36.540> follows<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
nice curve which exactly follows the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
nice curve which exactly follows the
overall<00:01:38.310> shape<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.299> next<00:01:39.570> thing<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:39.840> going

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
overall shape the next thing I'm going

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
overall shape the next thing I'm going
to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.009> into<00:01:41.189> my

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to do is I'm just going to go into my

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
to do is I'm just going to go into my
surfacing<00:01:42.390> tools<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> tell<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
surfacing tools and I'm going to tell it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.230 
surfacing tools and I'm going to tell it
to<00:01:44.250> intersect<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.930> surface<00:01:46.320> itself<00:01:47.240> so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to intersect with the surface itself so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.710 
to intersect with the surface itself so
not<00:01:48.420> only<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:48.960> put<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:51.240> there<00:01:51.540> but

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
not only can we put that in in there but

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.600 
not only can we put that in in there but
we<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:52.229> start<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.040> things<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
we can also start to do things with it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
we can also start to do things with it
so<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.020> ahead<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.740> back

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so I'm going to go ahead and go back

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.810 
so I'm going to go ahead and go back
into<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:57.860> conform<00:01:58.860> tool<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.640> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
into this conform tool and you know so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.020 
into this conform tool and you know so
I'm<00:01:59.909> back<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> conform<00:02:00.899> tool<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
I'm back into the conform tool now and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.219 
I'm back into the conform tool now and
the<00:02:03.030> next<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.540> want<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.140> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
the next thing that I want to do is I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.880 
the next thing that I want to do is I
want<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> elevate<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.360> when<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
want to elevate this so that when the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
want to elevate this so that when the
design<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.580> we're<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.879> pull<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> back

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
design so we're going to pull that back

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.960 
design so we're going to pull that back
through<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.619> surface<00:02:10.860> itself<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
through the surface itself you know so I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.500 
through the surface itself you know so I
can<00:02:12.180> change<00:02:12.480> its<00:02:12.750> height

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
can change its height

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.800 
can change its height
from<00:02:13.870> outside<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.709> inside<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.510> we're<00:02:16.690> just

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
from outside to inside and we're just

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.649 
from outside to inside and we're just
gonna<00:02:16.959> pull<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.379> back<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> little<00:02:17.769> bit<00:02:18.659> until

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
gonna pull it back a little bit until

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.740 
gonna pull it back a little bit until
this<00:02:19.989> intersection<00:02:20.620> line<00:02:21.120> actually<00:02:22.120> gets

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
this intersection line actually gets

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.550 
this intersection line actually gets
closer<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.760> where<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.950> end<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.519> at<00:02:28.560> just

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
closer to where this this end is at just

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.789 
closer to where this this end is at just
pull<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.860> back<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> little<00:02:30.310> bit<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:32.470> trying<00:02:32.709> to

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
pull it back a little bit not trying to

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.559 
pull it back a little bit not trying to
get<00:02:32.890> super<00:02:33.280> accurate<00:02:33.459> with<00:02:33.819> us<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.330> trying

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
get super accurate with us just trying

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.720 
get super accurate with us just trying
to<00:02:34.660> get<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.440> basic<00:02:35.860> concept<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.430> what<00:02:36.489> we're

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
to get the basic concept of what we're

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.479 
to get the basic concept of what we're
looking<00:02:36.879> for<00:02:37.530> what's<00:02:38.530> great<00:02:38.739> about<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:39.160> is

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
looking for what's great about this is

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.869 
looking for what's great about this is
as<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.569> cut<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.290> particular<00:02:41.860> object<00:02:42.069> now

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
as I cut that particular object now

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.910 
as I cut that particular object now
we'll<00:02:43.150> actually<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.110> pieces<00:02:44.319> to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
we'll actually have all the pieces to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.830 
we'll actually have all the pieces to
fill<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.610> back<00:02:45.760> side<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.450> front<00:02:46.480> side

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
fill in the back side and the front side

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.550 
fill in the back side and the front side
of<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.890> location<00:02:48.849> so<00:02:49.810> we're<00:02:50.230> done<00:02:50.410> with

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
of that that location so we're done with

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.710 
of that that location so we're done with
that<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.980> we're<00:02:51.609> going<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.849> know<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.690> same

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
that one we're going to know do the same

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.500 
that one we're going to know do the same
thing<00:02:53.109> with<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.500> more<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.010> go<00:02:54.430> back<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.970> this

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
thing with one more so go back to this

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.530 
thing with one more so go back to this
guy<00:02:55.750> here<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:58.000> we're<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.329> accept

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
guy here and so we're going to accept

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.789 
guy here and so we're going to accept
the<00:02:58.690> target<00:02:59.079> we're<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.470> put<00:02:59.650> another

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
the target we're going to put another

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.559 
the target we're going to put another
portal<00:03:01.079> into<00:03:02.549> onto<00:03:03.549> this<00:03:03.760> shape<00:03:04.299> here<00:03:04.510> so

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
portal into onto this shape here so

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.920 
portal into onto this shape here so
that's<00:03:04.840> my<00:03:05.109> destination<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:09.720> bet<00:03:10.720> on<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
that's my destination and bet on the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.339 
that's my destination and bet on the
wrong<00:03:11.019> side<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.799> we<00:03:12.609> delete<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.239> try<00:03:14.170> that

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
wrong side so we delete that try that

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:25.699 
wrong side so we delete that try that
again<00:03:16.049> put<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.170> on<00:03:17.319> this<00:03:17.560> guy<00:03:17.799> right<00:03:17.980> here

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.459 

so<00:03:26.480> that's<00:03:27.480> over<00:03:27.840> here<00:03:27.930> we're<00:03:28.140> going<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.319> put

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:28.469 
so that's over here we're going to put

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.039 
so that's over here we're going to put
this<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.650> pretty<00:03:29.010> close<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:30.030> side<00:03:30.299> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
this one pretty close to the side the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.780 
this one pretty close to the side the
other<00:03:31.079> portal<00:03:33.920> I'm<00:03:34.920> going<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.129> go<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.489> side

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
other portal I'm going to go to a side

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.050 
other portal I'm going to go to a side
view<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:37.519> that's<00:03:38.519> about<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.030> right

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
view and that's about the right

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.539 
view and that's about the right
orientation<00:03:39.420> I'm<00:03:40.019> looking<00:03:40.349> for<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.920> know<00:03:41.159> I

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
orientation I'm looking for I know I

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.000 
orientation I'm looking for I know I
want<00:03:41.969> them<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.180> kind<00:03:42.659> of<00:03:42.750> point<00:03:43.109> downwards<00:03:43.889> a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
want them to kind of point downwards a

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.679 
want them to kind of point downwards a
little<00:03:44.250> bit<00:03:44.400> kind<00:03:44.879> of<00:03:44.939> the<00:03:45.090> style<00:03:45.359> that<00:03:45.599> I'm

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
little bit kind of the style that I'm

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.220 
little bit kind of the style that I'm
looking<00:03:45.840> for<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.530> design<00:03:46.859> itself<00:03:47.250> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
looking for and the design itself and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.300 
looking for and the design itself and
we're<00:03:49.230> going<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.379> do<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> same<00:03:49.859> thing<00:03:50.159> we're

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
we're going to do the same thing we're

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.550 
we're going to do the same thing we're
going<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.489> intersect<00:03:50.969> that<00:03:51.090> with<00:03:51.560> this

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
going to intersect that with this

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.289 
going to intersect that with this
particular<00:03:53.069> surface<00:03:57.650> then<00:03:58.650> we're<00:03:58.889> going<00:03:59.189> to

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
particular surface then we're going to

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.349 
particular surface then we're going to
go<00:04:00.299> back<00:04:00.480> into<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.319> history<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:02.030> how<00:04:03.030> that's

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
go back into the history of how that's

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.390 
go back into the history of how that's
been<00:04:03.569> placed<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:04.169> there<00:04:04.409> and<00:04:04.590> then<00:04:05.220> we're

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
been placed on there and then we're

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.479 
been placed on there and then we're
going<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.549> go<00:04:05.700> ahead<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.269> elevate<00:04:06.629> that<00:04:07.489> guy

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
going to go ahead and elevate that guy

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.149 
going to go ahead and elevate that guy
so<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.450> he's<00:04:09.750> into<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.650> surface<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.069> little

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
so that he's into the surface a little

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:19.690 
so that he's into the surface a little
bit

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.150 

see<00:04:20.330> how<00:04:20.390> easy<00:04:20.660> this<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.140> to<00:04:21.200> manipulate<00:04:21.950> and

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
see how easy this is to manipulate and

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.950 
see how easy this is to manipulate and
work<00:04:22.280> with<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:24.280> wonderful<00:04:25.280> tool<00:04:25.960> that's

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
work with this wonderful tool that's

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.080 
work with this wonderful tool that's
exactly<00:04:27.470> where<00:04:27.620> I'm<00:04:27.740> looking<00:04:27.950> for<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.970> the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
exactly where I'm looking for so the

these up into a whole bunch of pieces
let's<00:04:51.890> take<00:04:52.070> a<00:04:52.100> look<00:04:52.340> at<00:04:52.430> what<00:04:52.580> we<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:52.910> now<00:04:54.970> so

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
we do a random material color surface

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.070 
we do a random material color surface
color<00:05:00.170> so<00:05:00.950> you<00:05:01.040> notice<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.550> my<00:05:01.910> my<00:05:02.660> actual

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
color so you notice that my my actual

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.780 
color so you notice that my my actual
portals<00:05:03.530> are<00:05:03.860> in<00:05:04.100> here<00:05:04.340> we're<00:05:04.580> going<00:05:04.670> to<00:05:04.730> end

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
we're going to take out so we don't need

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:20.740 
we're going to take out so we don't need
that<00:05:09.890> piece<00:05:10.790> there<00:05:11.210> at<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.540> very<00:05:11.890> base<00:05:12.890> of<00:05:12.920> it
