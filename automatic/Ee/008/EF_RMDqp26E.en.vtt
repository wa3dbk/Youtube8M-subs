that it's one of the harder moves to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.970 
that it's one of the harder moves to
learn<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.480> take<00:00:15.780> your<00:00:15.900> time<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.859> could

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
to get it solid so don't stress out

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.010 
to get it solid so don't stress out
about<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.420> fun<00:00:21.660> enjoy<00:00:21.869> the

learning<00:00:22.230> process<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.100> tried<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.820> put<00:00:23.970> together

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
learning process I tried to put together

learning process I tried to put together
a<00:00:24.359> quick<00:00:24.720> simple<00:00:25.050> video<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.800> made<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> easy

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
a quick simple video that made it easy

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.490 
a quick simple video that made it easy
for<00:00:27.029> everybody<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> key<00:00:27.960> points<00:00:28.320> down

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
for everybody to get the key points down

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
for everybody to get the key points down
and<00:00:28.769> hopefully<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.340> work<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.820> if

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and hopefully that will work for you if

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.279 
and hopefully that will work for you if
some<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> things<00:00:30.539> work<00:00:30.720> use<00:00:31.080> them

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
some of the things work use them

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.170 
some of the things work use them
improvise<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.279> fun<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.610> them<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
improvise have fun with them if some of

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
improvise have fun with them if some of
them<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.809> ignore<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> hopefully

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
them don't just ignore it and hopefully

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.740 
them don't just ignore it and hopefully
you'll<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.850> least<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.210> positive

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you'll get at least some positive

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.440 
you'll get at least some positive

instruction out of this video first
we're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> find<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> good<00:00:40.350> position<00:00:40.829> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
we're going to find a good position in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.459 
we're going to find a good position in
the<00:00:41.070> wheel<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.520> waltzing<00:00:42.030> my<00:00:42.750> wheel<00:00:42.989> has<00:00:43.170> five

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the wheel for waltzing my wheel has five

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
the wheel for waltzing my wheel has five
lines<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.160> we're<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
lines so we're going to use that to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.060 
lines so we're going to use that to
position<00:00:45.480> ourselves<00:00:45.629> within<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.350> wheel<00:00:46.530> if

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
position ourselves within the wheel if

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
position ourselves within the wheel if
your<00:00:47.280> wheel<00:00:47.430> doesn't<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.910> any<00:00:48.059> lines<00:00:48.329> you

going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.210> showing<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.570> guys<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.110> roll<00:01:49.290> by

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
going to be showing you guys the roll by

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.649 
going to be showing you guys the roll by
start<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.070> chose<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.880> start<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
start I chose this start because it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.300 
start I chose this start because it
starts<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> directly<00:01:52.439> into<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.920> Waltzing

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
starts you directly into the Waltzing

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.830 
starts you directly into the Waltzing
pattern<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> also<00:01:54.180> gives<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> good

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
pattern and it also gives you a good

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
pattern and it also gives you a good
amount<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.200> momentum<00:01:55.460> however<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.759> use

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
amount of momentum however you can use

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.130 
amount of momentum however you can use
any<00:01:57.060> start<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
any start you like and if you have a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.749 
any start you like and if you have a
different<00:01:58.530> start<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.860> prefer<00:01:59.189> feel<00:01:59.490> free<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
different start you prefer feel free to

different start you prefer feel free to
use<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.030> one

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
position you only have to do it every

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.570 
position you only have to do it every
time<00:05:21.229> you<00:05:21.440> come<00:05:21.620> around<00:05:21.740> wait<00:05:22.160> until<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.460> get

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
a good balance a squat on your right

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
foot and then go for the thrust just one

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.230 
foot and then go for the thrust just one
thrust<00:05:28.340> should<00:05:28.430> give<00:05:28.729> you<00:05:28.850> enough<00:05:29.060> momentum

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
thrust should give you enough momentum

just<00:05:32.270> wait<00:05:32.479> for<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.750> spin<00:05:33.110> that<00:05:33.320> feels<00:05:33.650> right

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
just wait for a spin that feels right

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.010 
just wait for a spin that feels right
when<00:05:34.789> you<00:05:34.910> get<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.210> movement<00:05:35.419> properly

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
when you get the movement properly

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.129 
when you get the movement properly
you'll<00:05:36.200> really<00:05:36.440> feel<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.770> boost<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.699> energy<00:05:38.139> if

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
you'll really feel a boost of energy if

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.719 
you'll really feel a boost of energy if
you're<00:05:39.590> not<00:05:39.740> feeling<00:05:40.039> like<00:05:40.070> a<00:05:40.280> really<00:05:40.490> strong

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
you're not feeling like a really strong

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.670 
you're not feeling like a really strong
boost<00:05:41.120> your<00:05:41.360> timing<00:05:41.840> is<00:05:41.930> slightly<00:05:42.199> off<00:05:42.470> or

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
boost your timing is slightly off or

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.230 
boost your timing is slightly off or
something<00:05:43.039> play<00:05:43.280> around<00:05:43.520> with<00:05:43.639> it<00:05:43.850> but<00:05:43.880> once

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
something play around with it but once

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.960 
something play around with it but once
you<00:05:44.360> get<00:05:44.539> it<00:05:44.660> you'll<00:05:44.840> know<00:05:45.020> that<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.380> got<00:05:45.620> it

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970
