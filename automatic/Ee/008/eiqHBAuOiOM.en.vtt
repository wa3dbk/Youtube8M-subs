darker shade of gray that once I can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.639 
darker shade of gray that once I can
pretty<00:00:56.329> much<00:00:56.510> makes<00:00:56.719> every<00:00:57.020> color<00:00:57.230> along<00:00:57.440> this

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
pretty much makes every color along this

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.200 
pretty much makes every color along this
bar<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.399> gives<00:00:58.579> me<00:00:58.670> hundreds<00:00:59.120> of

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
bar and that gives me hundreds of

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:15.210 
bar and that gives me hundreds of
differentiation<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.809> draw<00:01:00.050> away

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
in case I want to make changes to it

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.870 
in case I want to make changes to it

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
later right

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.090 
later right
so<00:01:29.479> what<00:01:29.990> I'll<00:01:30.050> do<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.440> I'll<00:01:30.590> just<00:01:30.619> save<00:01:30.920> this

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
so what I'll do is I'll just save this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.660 
so what I'll do is I'll just save this
to<00:01:31.700> my<00:01:31.729> gallery<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:33.229> then<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.160> will<00:01:34.280> pop<00:01:34.430> up<00:01:34.460> as

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
to my gallery and then it will pop up as

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.300 
to my gallery and then it will pop up as
your<00:01:34.850> most<00:01:35.210> recent<00:01:35.600> image<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.259> then<00:01:37.220> I'll

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
your most recent image and then I'll

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.730 
your most recent image and then I'll
copy<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:37.700> back<00:01:37.910> into<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.270> new<00:01:38.479> canvas<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.590> this

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
copy this back into a new canvas so this

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:57.120 
copy this back into a new canvas so this
becomes<00:01:40.190> essentially<00:01:40.670> my<00:01:40.790> second<00:01:41.090> version<00:01:41.240> a

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.370 

third<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.270> refine<00:01:59.570> your<00:01:59.630> drawings<00:02:00.080> as<00:02:00.259> you

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
third is to refine your drawings as you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.340 
third is to refine your drawings as you
go<00:02:00.500> along<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:01.700> color<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.270> now<00:02:02.630> overlapping

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
go along the color is now overlapping

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.230 
go along the color is now overlapping
the<00:02:03.740> actual<00:02:03.979> line<00:02:04.130> art<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.580> I've<00:02:04.670> done<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.210> I

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
the actual line art that I've done so I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.450 
the actual line art that I've done so I
actually<00:02:05.450> want<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.869> remove<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.649> an<00:02:07.039> eraser

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
actually want to remove that an eraser

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.070 
actually want to remove that an eraser
