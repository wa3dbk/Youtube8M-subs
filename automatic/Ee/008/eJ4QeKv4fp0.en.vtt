that<00:06:08.910> core<00:06:09.150> Tech<00:06:09.330> did<00:06:09.450> that<00:06:09.570> I<00:06:09.630> really<00:06:09.930> liked

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
that core Tech did that I really liked

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.510 
that core Tech did that I really liked
sometimes<00:06:10.770> when<00:06:10.920> you're<00:06:11.010> putting<00:06:11.190> the<00:06:11.310> rain

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
sometimes when you're putting the rain

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.610 
sometimes when you're putting the rain
liner<00:06:11.730> back<00:06:12.120> in<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.420> pants<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:13.080> gets<00:06:13.350> a<00:06:13.440> little

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
liner back in the pants it gets a little

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.340 
liner back in the pants it gets a little
bit<00:06:13.830> confusing<00:06:13.920> so<00:06:14.850> what<00:06:15.000> core<00:06:15.270> tech<00:06:15.480> did<00:06:15.720> if<00:06:16.200> I

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
bit confusing so what core tech did if I

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.660 
bit confusing so what core tech did if I
spin<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.710> around<00:06:16.860> you<00:06:17.010> can<00:06:17.100> actually<00:06:17.190> see<00:06:17.550> it

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
spin this around you can actually see it

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.360 
spin this around you can actually see it
on<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:18.240> outside<00:06:18.660> they<00:06:19.230> used<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.620> white<00:06:20.040> snap

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
on the outside they used a white snap

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.000 
on the outside they used a white snap
and<00:06:20.670> then<00:06:21.030> on<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.210> inside<00:06:21.540> they<00:06:22.140> used<00:06:22.410> a<00:06:22.620> gray

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
and then on the inside they used a gray

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.950 
and then on the inside they used a gray
snap<00:06:23.340> so<00:06:23.820> it<00:06:24.000> really<00:06:24.300> allows<00:06:24.540> you<00:06:24.660> to<00:06:24.750> color

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
snap so it really allows you to color

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.180 
snap so it really allows you to color
coordinate<00:06:25.290> so<00:06:25.650> when<00:06:25.770> you're<00:06:25.860> putting<00:06:26.040> this

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
coordinate so when you're putting this

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.340 
coordinate so when you're putting this
back<00:06:26.370> in<00:06:26.610> it's<00:06:26.910> super<00:06:27.390> easy<00:06:27.660> to<00:06:27.900> get<00:06:27.990> that<00:06:28.140> rain

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
back in it's super easy to get that rain

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.810 
back in it's super easy to get that rain
liner<00:06:28.530> back<00:06:28.770> in<00:06:28.920> the<00:06:29.010> pants<00:06:29.340> once<00:06:29.670> you've
