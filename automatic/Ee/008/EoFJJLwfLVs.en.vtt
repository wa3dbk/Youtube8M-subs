you how to set up port forwarding on

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.970 
you how to set up port forwarding on
your<00:00:08.910> router<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.929> allow<00:00:10.139> external

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
your router to allow external

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.799 
your router to allow external
connections<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.730> connect<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.150> your<00:00:12.269> minecraft

connections to connect to your minecraft

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.259 
connections to connect to your minecraft
server<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.130> I'm<00:00:14.400> actually<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.849> Minecraft

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
server so I'm actually in Minecraft

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.510 
server so I'm actually in Minecraft
right<00:00:15.540> now<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> as<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.440> see<00:00:16.470> my<00:00:17.250> server

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
right now and as you can see my server

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.720 
right now and as you can see my server
is<00:00:17.789> running<00:00:18.000> however<00:00:18.840> I'm<00:00:19.460> running<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> only

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
is running however I'm running it only

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
is running however I'm running it only
locally<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.600> that's<00:00:21.779> sort<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> my<00:00:22.170> local<00:00:22.500> IP

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
locally so that's sort of my local IP

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
locally so that's sort of my local IP
there<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.939> look<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.689> my

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
there if you look here this is my

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.750 
there if you look here this is my
external<00:00:25.500> IP<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.070> somebody<00:00:26.369> want<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> actually

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
external IP if somebody want to actually

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400 
external IP if somebody want to actually
connect<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.330> outside<00:00:27.689> my<00:00:27.840> network<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.320> can

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
connect from outside my network you can

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.650 
connect from outside my network you can
see<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> server<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:30.210> can't<00:00:30.449> reach

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
see that the server is you can't reach

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.870 
see that the server is you can't reach
it<00:00:30.869> right<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.790> is

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
it right now so what you have to do is

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.220 
it right now so what you have to do is
you<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> set<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.390> port<00:00:33.630> forwarding<00:00:33.719> in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
you have to set up port forwarding in

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
you have to set up port forwarding in
order<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> allow<00:00:34.890> connections<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> come<00:00:35.850> into

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
order to allow connections to come into

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.190 
order to allow connections to come into
your<00:00:36.960> network<00:00:37.219> to<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> your

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
your network to do that you go to your

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950 
your network to do that you go to your
connection<00:00:40.950> hub<00:00:41.250> whichever<00:00:42.210> router<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.750> have

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
connection hub whichever router you have

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.350 
connection hub whichever router you have
usually<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.070> IP<00:00:44.250> address<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:45.059> sort<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
usually the IP address is sort of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.560 
usually the IP address is sort of
similar<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:47.030> once<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.329> there

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
similar to that once you're in there

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.389 
similar to that once you're in there
there<00:00:49.050> should<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.590> sort<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.829> games<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
there should be some sort of games and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
there should be some sort of games and
application<00:00:50.940> setting<00:00:51.440> there's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> old

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
application setting there's a lot of old

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
application setting there's a lot of old
games<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.059> sort<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> select<00:00:54.899> none

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
games that you can sort of select none

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.729 
games that you can sort of select none
of<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.070> apply<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> add<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> game<00:00:58.559> or

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
of which apply so go to add a game or

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.299 
of which apply so go to add a game or

application find the app IP address of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
application find the app IP address of
the<00:01:02.370> computer<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:03.059> currently<00:01:03.449> using<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the computer you're currently using to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.700 
the computer you're currently using to
host<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> server<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.820> mine<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.390> 192<00:01:06.990> 168

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
host the server so mine would be 192 168

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.460 
host the server so mine would be 192 168
dot-to-dot<00:01:08.549> 12<00:01:10.460> hit<00:01:11.460> save<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.420> ok<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
dot-to-dot 12 hit save there ok so the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
dot-to-dot 12 hit save there ok so the
idea<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> we're<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.670> create<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
idea is that we're going to create a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.690 
idea is that we're going to create a
port<00:01:15.270> forwarding<00:01:16.080> rule<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.580> go

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
port forwarding rule so I'm going to go

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390 
port forwarding rule so I'm going to go
create<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> new<00:01:18.270> rule<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> title

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
create a new rule and I'm going to title

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.030 
create a new rule and I'm going to title
it<00:01:20.490> minecraft<00:01:21.380> I'm<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> leave<00:01:22.770> the
