00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
we start the round brushing the reason

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
we start the round brushing the reason
being<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.480> don't<00:00:48.570> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> spend<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.379> much

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
being is you don't want to spend so much

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
being is you don't want to spend so much
time<00:00:49.820> around<00:00:50.820> brushing<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> hair<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
time around brushing the hair that you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
time around brushing the hair that you
actually<00:00:51.960> damage<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> heat<00:00:53.280> for

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
actually damage it with the heat for

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually damage it with the heat for
sectioning<00:00:54.239> off<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> hair<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.960> find<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
sectioning off the hair I find one of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.750 
sectioning off the hair I find one of
the<00:00:55.649> easiest<00:00:55.980> things<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.370> you're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> be

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the easiest things if you're going to be

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.090 
the easiest things if you're going to be
doing<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.149> yourself<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.350> rid<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
doing it yourself is to get rid of the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.270 
doing it yourself is to get rid of the
hair<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.870> create<00:01:01.140> sections<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
hair to to really create sections of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
hair to to really create sections of
hair<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:03.600> working<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
hair that you're working with where you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890 
hair that you're working with where you
won't<00:01:04.680> accidentally<00:01:05.489> drag<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.510> hair

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
won't accidentally drag in more hair

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
won't accidentally drag in more hair
hair<00:01:07.619> stylists<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.189> very<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.640> good<00:01:08.909> at

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
hair stylists are very very good at

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
hair stylists are very very good at
going<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.200> keeping<00:01:10.500> hair<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> way

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
going in and keeping hair out of the way

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630 
going in and keeping hair out of the way
why<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:11.970> work<00:01:12.350> but<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.770> home<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.310> really

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
why they work but for at home you really

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.130 
why they work but for at home you really
just<00:01:15.049> want<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> create<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:17.340> section

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.080 

so<00:01:20.770> essentially<00:01:21.250> what<00:01:21.370> i'm<00:01:21.490> doing<00:01:21.790> here<00:01:22.030> is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
so essentially what i'm doing here is

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.750 
so essentially what i'm doing here is
just<00:01:22.240> locking<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:23.140> some<00:01:23.380> shine<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
just locking in some shine that the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.820 
just locking in some shine that the
products<00:01:25.270> offer<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:26.080> want<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.380> seal<00:01:26.560> them<00:01:26.740> in

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
products offer you want to seal them in

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.649 
products offer you want to seal them in
with<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.040> brush<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.940> little<00:01:28.150> bit<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:28.330> heat

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
with a brush and a little bit of heat

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.780 
with a brush and a little bit of heat
and<00:01:28.869> then<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.619> can<00:01:29.800> go<00:01:29.920> in<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.100> create<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.550> very

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
and then you can go in and create a very

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.719 
and then you can go in and create a very
modern<00:01:31.240> texture<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.050> still<00:01:32.979> show<00:01:33.220> how<00:01:33.430> shiny

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and healthy the hair is and how much the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.480 
and healthy the hair is and how much the
products<00:01:35.890> are<00:01:36.040> working<00:01:37.950> okay<00:01:38.950> now<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.160> trick

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
products are working okay now the trick

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.649 
products are working okay now the trick
to<00:01:39.520> achieving<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.530> particular<00:01:41.950> up<00:01:42.369> do<00:01:42.729> which

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
to achieving this particular up do which

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.660 
to achieving this particular up do which
is<00:01:43.690> very<00:01:44.080> tight<00:01:44.590> at<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.890> back<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.490> neck

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
is very tight at the back of the neck

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.850 
is very tight at the back of the neck
and<00:01:45.909> then<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.210> has<00:01:46.450> sort<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.930> loose<00:01:47.200> quality

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
and then it has sort of a loose quality

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.859 
and then it has sort of a loose quality
to<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.100> front<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.580> top<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.659> you're<00:01:49.750> going

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
to the front and the top so you're going

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.650 
to the front and the top so you're going
to<00:01:49.960> put<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.290> up<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.680> two<00:01:50.979> sections<00:01:51.660> first

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
to put this up in two sections first

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.130 
to put this up in two sections first
starting<00:01:53.200> from<00:01:53.710> ear<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.160> ear<00:01:54.720> across<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.930> top

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
starting from ear to ear across the top

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.300 
starting from ear to ear across the top
