just over a ton dimensions have also

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.590 
just over a ton dimensions have also
changed<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.589> got<00:00:55.739> longer<00:00:56.069> and<00:00:56.399> wider<00:00:56.819> but

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
changed so it's got longer and wider but

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540 
changed so it's got longer and wider but
the<00:00:57.690> roofline<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.319> lower<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.710> expect<00:00:59.339> less
