3 4 5 6 7 8 we all know this C scale and
if<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.430> build<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.789> cord<00:05:30.030> on<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.180> one<00:05:30.479> chord

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
if you build a cord on the one chord

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.680 
if you build a cord on the one chord
build<00:05:32.039> a<00:05:32.160> cordon<00:05:32.550> see<00:05:32.880> it<00:05:33.150> will<00:05:33.240> be<00:05:33.330> called<00:05:33.570> the

build a cordon see it will be called the
1<00:05:33.900> chord<00:05:34.140> in<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.289> key<00:05:34.350> of<00:05:34.530> C<00:05:34.650> so<00:05:34.979> you'll<00:05:35.130> play<00:05:35.390> C

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
1 chord in the key of C so you'll play C

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.620 
1 chord in the key of C so you'll play C
E<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:37.770> G<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.580> that's<00:05:38.970> explained<00:05:39.419> on<00:05:39.600> the

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
E and G and that's explained on the

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.350 
E and G and that's explained on the
video<00:05:40.280> based<00:05:41.280> on<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.580> four<00:05:41.820> chord<00:05:42.120> you'll

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
video based on the four chord you'll

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.180 
video based on the four chord you'll
start<00:05:42.750> on<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:43.020> on<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.260> 4th<00:05:43.770> degree<00:05:43.919> of<00:05:44.130> the

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
start on the on the 4th degree of the

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.710 
start on the on the 4th degree of the
scale<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.729> play<00:05:45.510> F<00:05:45.810> a<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:46.860> C<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:48.150> 5<00:05:48.419> chord

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
scale and play F a and C the 5 chord

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.620 
scale and play F a and C the 5 chord
would<00:05:48.990> be<00:05:49.140> G<00:05:49.440> B<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:50.220> D<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:50.729> that's<00:05:51.180> explained

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
would be G B and D and that's explained

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.570 
would be G B and D and that's explained
on<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.900> video<00:05:52.140> too<00:05:52.260> but<00:05:53.010> be<00:05:53.099> sure<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.460> read

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
on the video too but be sure and read

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.670 
on the video too but be sure and read
all<00:05:53.910> that<00:05:54.150> you'll<00:05:54.720> see<00:05:54.900> what<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.169> cords<00:05:55.440> look

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
all that you'll see what the cords look

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.080 
all that you'll see what the cords look
like<00:05:55.919> they're<00:05:56.160> there's<00:05:56.370> a<00:05:56.460> seat<00:05:56.760> core

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
like they're there's a seat core

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.670 
like they're there's a seat core
which<00:05:57.630> would<00:05:57.810> be<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:58.020> one<00:05:58.199> chord<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.590> key

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
which would be the one chord in the key

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.500 
which would be the one chord in the key
of<00:05:58.830> C<00:05:58.949> the<00:05:59.280> four<00:05:59.490> chord<00:05:59.760> in<00:05:59.850> the<00:05:59.880> key<00:05:59.940> of<00:06:00.120> C<00:06:00.210> and

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
of C the four chord in the key of C and

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.950 
of C the four chord in the key of C and
the<00:06:00.600> five<00:06:00.840> chord<00:06:01.169> in<00:06:01.260> the<00:06:01.290> key<00:06:01.380> of<00:06:01.560> C<00:06:02.960> and

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
the five chord in the key of C and

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.409 
the five chord in the key of C and
you'll<00:06:04.320> notice<00:06:04.530> that<00:06:04.680> those<00:06:04.980> notes<00:06:05.419> contain

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
you'll notice that those notes contain

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.590 
you'll notice that those notes contain
all<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.750> notes<00:06:07.110> in<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.380> C<00:06:07.560> scale<00:06:08.240> so<00:06:09.240> that

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
all the notes in the C scale so that

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.510 
all the notes in the C scale so that
means<00:06:10.169> you're<00:06:10.290> going<00:06:10.350> to<00:06:10.470> harmonize<00:06:10.860> any<00:06:11.220> note

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
means you're going to harmonize any note

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.950 
means you're going to harmonize any note
in<00:06:11.699> the<00:06:11.790> melody<00:06:12.150> with<00:06:12.330> just<00:06:12.570> one<00:06:12.750> of<00:06:12.840> those

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
in the melody with just one of those

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.960 
in the melody with just one of those
three<00:06:13.229> chords<00:06:13.590> which<00:06:13.740> is<00:06:13.860> a<00:06:13.889> great<00:06:14.160> insight<00:06:14.729> so

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
three chords which is a great insight so

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.969 
three chords which is a great insight so
read<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:15.300> carefully<00:06:15.510> and<00:06:15.990> then<00:06:16.500> this<00:06:16.740> gives

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
read that carefully and then this gives

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.820 
read that carefully and then this gives
the<00:06:17.250> three<00:06:17.910> main<00:06:18.120> chords<00:06:18.510> in<00:06:18.660> every<00:06:18.960> key<00:06:19.229> if

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
the three main chords in every key if

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.290 
the three main chords in every key if
you<00:06:20.010> want<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.310> know<00:06:20.370> the<00:06:20.400> key<00:06:20.699> of<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:21.030> for
