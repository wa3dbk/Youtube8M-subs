00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
actually basically the correct aspect

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.830 
actually basically the correct aspect
ratio<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.560> 133<00:01:10.560> ratio<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.630> get

the<00:01:17.580> image<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.060> completely<00:01:18.390> fill<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.780> your

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the image to completely fill up your

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.380 
the image to completely fill up your
phone<00:01:19.110> screen<00:01:24.380> there's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.470> CPU<00:01:26.310> bias<00:01:26.640> setting

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
phone screen there's a CPU bias setting

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.260 
phone screen there's a CPU bias setting
by<00:01:27.750> default<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.759> point<00:01:30.000> but

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
by default it's on one at this point but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.990 
by default it's on one at this point but
apparently<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.990> should<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.070> 2<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:32.729> greater

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
apparently it should be on 2 or greater

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
apparently it should be on 2 or greater
so<00:01:33.470> switched<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> 2<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.240> choose

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so switched it to 2 and you can choose

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.950 
so switched it to 2 and you can choose
the<00:01:36.570> PlayStation<00:01:37.290> CPU<00:01:37.740> speed<00:01:38.070> I've<00:01:38.880> set<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.840> up

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the PlayStation CPU speed I've set it up

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.230 
the PlayStation CPU speed I've set it up
to<00:01:40.110> 100%<00:01:40.500> we'll<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.070> how<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.250> goes<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.820> can

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to 100% we'll see how that goes you can

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
to 100% we'll see how that goes you can
also<00:01:42.329> disable<00:01:42.689> or<00:01:43.290> enable<00:01:43.320> bios

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
also disable or enable bios

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.210 
also disable or enable bios
interestingly<00:01:45.409> some<00:01:46.409> games<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.799> work<00:01:46.979> with

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
interestingly some games will work with

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
interestingly some games will work with
it<00:01:47.430> off<00:01:47.780> only<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.170> vice<00:01:49.380> versa<00:01:50.540> then<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.630> have

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it off only and vice versa then we have

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
it off only and vice versa then we have
control<00:01:52.110> options<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.799> supports<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> Moga

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
control options this supports the Moga

control options this supports the Moga
pro<00:01:53.670> controller<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.200> great

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
pro controller which is a really great

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.780 
pro controller which is a really great
feature<00:01:55.590> although<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
feature although I don't have one to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.569 
feature although I don't have one to
test<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.189> two<00:01:59.549> different

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
test it with you can have two different

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.950 
test it with you can have two different

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.530 

and<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.220> reposition<00:02:12.880> buttons<00:02:13.300> if<00:02:13.450> you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and you can reposition buttons if you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.979 
and you can reposition buttons if you
want<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.500> here<00:02:14.709> are<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.860> simple<00:02:15.069> controls<00:02:15.989> so

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
want and here are the simple controls so

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.540 
want and here are the simple controls so
all<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.560> buttons<00:02:17.800> are<00:02:17.920> still<00:02:18.099> in<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.340> same

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
all the buttons are still in the same

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.729 
all the buttons are still in the same
place<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.239> looks<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> little<00:02:20.260> bit<00:02:20.470> less

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
place it just looks a little bit less

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.620 
place it just looks a little bit less
visually<00:02:21.220> distracting<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.819> guess<00:02:22.000> well<00:02:22.599> I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
visually distracting I guess well I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.740 
visually distracting I guess well I
prefer<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.290> more<00:02:23.530> accurate<00:02:24.060> look<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.300> having

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
prefer the more accurate look of having

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.630 
prefer the more accurate look of having
it<00:02:25.870> off<00:02:28.590> that's<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.739> four<00:02:29.890> options<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.489> I've

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
it off that's it four options so I've
