00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.550 
and gentlemen he's actually shifted this
piece<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.970> concrete<00:04:16.209> barrier<00:04:16.810> here<00:04:17.079> he's<00:04:17.350> hit

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
piece of concrete barrier here he's hit

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.250 
piece of concrete barrier here he's hit
it<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.769> hard<00:04:17.979> well<00:04:18.880> crap<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.900> piece<00:04:20.229> of

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
it that hard well crap that piece of

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.650 
it that hard well crap that piece of
concrete<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.880> think<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.120> deserves<00:04:22.360> an
