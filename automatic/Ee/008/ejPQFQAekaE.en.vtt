00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.309
 a certain day today for what was said by mauro and 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.900
 they study against the terrorists if 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.670
 we have actually heard about 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.530
 training because it was not trained bullseye 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.209
 you about relationships and 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.160
 discomfort of mature 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.070
 we have requested a report from 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.230
 medical department and nothing we are to the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.390
 wait for the report to take the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.759
 immediate actions or a leaked 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.619
 possible exit of the forward that there is is 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.359
 true with all this not the absolute 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.489
 we are also worried because what 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.250
 What we want is that mature is already fit 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.370
 he comes from an injury that has 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.790
 postponed almost three times out of the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.340
 courts 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.050
 and now that he is about to play 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.640
 this one in no time we have thought about 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.520
 that at all matures better than it is 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.110
 important to the team for the club and 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.700
 what we want most whoever is 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.440
 apt to be able to play a forward that 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.820
 He has given us many joys many 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 satisfactions would we effectively 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.940
 bad is to be thinking one thing without more 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.590
 even when you're injured, not what 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.680
 we want is to have it totally 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.239
 recovered and that can happen to carry what 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.229
 that he has not that psychic strength 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.810
 in front and that smell of goal that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.460
 he has mature that whenever he has entered 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.050
 in difficult matches has been the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.910
 important location for the victories 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.729
 there is a rumor that johnnier montaÃ±o 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.100
 could go back alliance look at these 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.770
 last days the truth is that they begin 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.140
 the speculations now that we do not 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.830
 we have pronounced at all not you 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 I will deny that 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.480
 in mountain is a player that as well 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.020
 you say you were the club because how many 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.360
 teams would like to have it but we have not 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.820
 spoken in no time we do not respect 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.890
 what is professional like him in this 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.860
 moment participates from one of another team 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.750
 so it would be wrong for me to give some 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.940
 opinion because there is nothing about it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.120
 what would be the message liked last 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.860
 to all the supporters aliancistas of 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.390
 some way they want quiet for the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.130
 club if the main thing that we are 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.110
 working to reinforce the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.960
 team and we are waiting for the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.110
 finalization of the opening championship 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.790
 to meet with Robert not to be 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.950
 receive the report that we have requested 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.540
 and see what is best for the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.070
 team because we are definitely going to 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.410
 we are going to reinforce the team or that the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.940
 of the fans is that the members are 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.220
 quiet that we are working on 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.230
 function of improving the team of 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.230
 reinforce it within the possibilities
