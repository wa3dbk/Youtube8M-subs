00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.659 

all<00:00:01.290> right<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:01.439> figured<00:00:01.829> I'd<00:00:01.979> make<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.429> quick

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
all right I figured I'd make a quick

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.889 
all right I figured I'd make a quick
video<00:00:02.850> just<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.449> show<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:05.009> hydro<00:00:05.640> turf<00:00:05.899> for

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
video just to show the hydro turf for

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.810 
video just to show the hydro turf for
the<00:00:07.370> speedster<00:00:08.370> 150<00:00:09.740> it<00:00:10.740> took<00:00:10.889> me<00:00:11.040> maybe<00:00:11.550> about

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
the speedster 150 it took me maybe about

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.240 
the speedster 150 it took me maybe about
an<00:00:11.910> hour<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> half<00:00:12.500> to<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.130> was

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
an hour and a half to do it it was

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.440 
an hour and a half to do it it was
really<00:00:14.519> pretty<00:00:14.969> easy

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
really pretty easy

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.220 
really pretty easy
everything<00:00:16.260> comes<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.650> pre-cut<00:00:17.600> I<00:00:18.600> just

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
everything comes a pre-cut I just

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.310 
everything comes a pre-cut I just
basically<00:00:19.470> lined<00:00:19.949> up<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> lines<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:21.660> are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
basically lined up the lines that are

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.390 
basically lined up the lines that are
already<00:00:22.590> existing<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.430> boat<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
already existing on the boat and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.950 
already existing on the boat and
basically<00:00:26.400> peeled<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.060> paper<00:00:27.869> back<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:29.960> use

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
basically peeled the paper back and use

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
basically peeled the paper back and use
pressure<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.590> push<00:00:31.769> down<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.730> peeled<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
pressure to push down and as I peeled it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.630 
pressure to push down and as I peeled it
and<00:00:34.050> actually<00:00:35.040> came<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.370> pretty<00:00:35.520> good<00:00:37.640> it's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and actually came out pretty good it's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459 
and actually came out pretty good it's
nice<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.930> does<00:00:40.170> come

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
nice because it all is it does come

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.970 
nice because it all is it does come
pre-cut<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:43.260> only<00:00:43.469> thing<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.680> thought<00:00:43.860> was

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
pre-cut the only thing I thought was

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.569 
pre-cut the only thing I thought was
kind<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> odd<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.840> here<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> can't<00:00:47.460> really

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
kind of odd was here you can't really

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.119 
kind of odd was here you can't really
see<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.420> actually<00:00:48.870> did<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.500> pretty<00:00:49.920> decent

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
see it it actually did a pretty decent

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
see it it actually did a pretty decent
job<00:00:51.860> but<00:00:52.860> there<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.460> cut<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.300> there

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
job but there it is cut in there

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.000 
job but there it is cut in there
actually<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.219> right<00:00:56.370> there<00:01:01.010> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
actually you can see it right there you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
actually you can see it right there you
can't<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> though<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:03.090> here

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
can't really see it though from here

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.660 
can't really see it though from here
like<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
like that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.840 
like that
here<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.490> pushed

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
here you can see it and that was pushed

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.070 
here you can see it and that was pushed
up<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
up all the way but you can see it like

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
up all the way but you can see it like
that<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.560> touching<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that is touching there but there is a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.899 
that is touching there but there is a
gap<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:16.830> can't<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.430> much<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
gap you can't really do much about that

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.130 
gap you can't really do much about that
yeah<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> only<00:01:21.600> thing<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.840> thought<00:01:21.990> was

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
yeah that's the only thing I thought was

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 
yeah that's the only thing I thought was
kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> odd<00:01:22.500> why<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:22.830> had<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> cut<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> right

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
kind of odd why they had to cut it right

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
kind of odd why they had to cut it right
there<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.689> mean<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.530> piece<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.720> hole

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
there I mean this piece here is one hole

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.999 
there I mean this piece here is one hole
set<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.700> came<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:30.090> together<00:01:30.210> so

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
set and the that came all together so

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
set and the that came all together so
very<00:01:32.009> interesting<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.079> came<00:01:34.259> out

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
very interesting but not it came out

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.609 
very interesting but not it came out
pretty<00:01:34.560> good<00:01:35.960> like<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> said<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.439> an

so<00:02:29.490> we'll<00:02:29.790> see<00:02:29.970> how<00:02:30.150> well<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.050> sticks<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:33.210> is

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
so we'll see how well that sticks it is

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.760 
so we'll see how well that sticks it is
I'm<00:02:33.540> pretty<00:02:33.810> good<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:33.990> did<00:02:34.200> push<00:02:34.440> pretty<00:02:34.680> hard

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
I'm pretty good I did push pretty hard

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.960 
I'm pretty good I did push pretty hard
for<00:02:35.730> about<00:02:35.880> 10<00:02:36.120> minutes<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.700> that's<00:02:38.700> why<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
for about 10 minutes so that's why the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.490 
for about 10 minutes so that's why the
only<00:02:39.150> piece<00:02:39.420> I'm<00:02:39.570> kind<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.810> worried<00:02:40.020> about<00:02:40.080> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
only piece I'm kind of worried about and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.260 
only piece I'm kind of worried about and

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
then this one's not so bad it does have

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.270 
then this one's not so bad it does have
a<00:02:42.330> kind<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.690> lip<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:43.500> too<00:02:43.680> bad<00:02:44.240> so
