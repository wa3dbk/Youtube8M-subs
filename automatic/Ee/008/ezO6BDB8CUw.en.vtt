 and like those 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.109
 its end is the different

 input 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.440
 because I'm going to do it was a match 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.680
 a copper shake 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.340
 the ice cream and by the way 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.250

 dn if you like it, you do not know either the colocolino forward 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.080
 if you like expressed 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 the key is that it puts the same game of the opponent 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.010
 the same number of times I've given 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.660
 how am i going to do 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.330

 English through the window 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.460
 to the team that's enough if we were all a little pesitos to be noticed 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.040

 what are the fogueres 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.340
