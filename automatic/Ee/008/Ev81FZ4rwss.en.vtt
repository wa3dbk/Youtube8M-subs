00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.140
 This item is made possible by 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.140
 deltion college and ipu media 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.010
 after the internationals were back 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.840
 turned at pec zwolle 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.279
 Come focus on this week 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.840
 against the match of Saturday at home 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.980
 Willem 2 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.750
 a competition that is overshadowed 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.640
 by the upcoming cup match of 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.679
 Tuesday against FC Twente 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.849
 yeah I do not know the train has also been 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.820
 is really the game of tomorrow 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.109
 the most important if you winters 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.270
 best preparation that you can have and 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.070
 also in terms of feeling of course a nasty 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.870
 book tough game but I think if 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.940
 you just for tomorrow with a good 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.080
 feeling the field goes that you are tasty 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.030
 to that contest contour line of 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.840
 Tuesday after being a lot by 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.060
 talked about but you are just going this 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.950
 kind for competition in that yard of 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.780
 twente is so important 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.730
 so then it is actually just Willem 2 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.770
 if you just played well, you win 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.870
 then that is the perfect preparation 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.250
 in a row the game against twente so that 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.350
 is the approach 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.970
 in the 2 comes to visit here it does 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.320
 well this seasons name is a good one 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.509
 plow 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.860
 clearly how they how they play hoof 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.860
 you press put how they want to 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.310
 and they also have no points 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.750
 almost stolen and yes it is 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.330
 so interesting opponent even though 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.370
 because we are now at 7, 8 and 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.310
 is exactly the dividing line between 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.530
 play-offs yes or no then we want yes and no 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.680
 we both want first seven and can 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.760
 doing very good business or it will be something 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.159
 more difficult but 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.050
 yes you would rather go for the good things 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.370
 so doing good business against the will and 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.470
 two of jurgen that this is 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.000
 season is doing well with fun 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.990
 soccer at only five points from pec 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.610
 zwolle 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.110
 for the people of Zwolle the task is therefore to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.860
 not to let Tilburgers get closer 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.380
 come 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.880
 anyone can calculate 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.340
 it can remain five points 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.320
 two words or 8 8 or 2 the the shield 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.729
 naturally huge and like us from willem 2 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.090
 want then there is a pre us no more 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.829
 to catch up 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.780
 Well definitely test them right now 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.250
 an excellent year open with heavy 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.899
 very good football 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.759
 sauna as said 5 point to tomorrow 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.079
 among our as you can win it then 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.240
 then you think they are no longer with you 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.710
 occur for possible after competition 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.329
 so yes certainly important match 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.130
 earlier this season with with minimal 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.690
 won the difference from willem 2 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.489
 in tilburg a goal of no 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.930
 sees a final score 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.030
 but for us this was a match with 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.830
 A good earth memory I would sometimes 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.200
 an away game such as a reasonable chicken 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.430
 would like to see where we 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.360
 not really great football but 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 give away very little 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.489
 where maybe willem 2 more on more 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.290
 the ball has but are very effective 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.000
 and then you just win one 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.549
 away match and at utrecht there too 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.049
 had a competition and there we have to 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.810
 still have evolved from 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.040
 actually too few results and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.760
 achieved 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.950
 we play at home now and yes I think so 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.720
 we also home the oh and excelsior there 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.980
 where we have so many ball passes 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.670
 both chairman give so much 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.109
 goal attempts but yes to which the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.609
 missed a phase and you get a 0 and then 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.290
 should actually finish 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.819
 I thought it was unfortunate 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.290
 of course disappoint in the game 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.840
 that should be corrected tomorrow 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.269
 how can you win from willem 2 through it 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.709
 one more goal he scored just us 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.160
 own games tie will do it 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.650
 Always good 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.900
 I think it should play like 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.670
 against excelsior only then the chance one 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.980
 You must be better and and goals 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.900
 have to get in and then make sure you can 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.700
 software fall then the three point 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.900
 stay here in zwolle therefore grab it 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.850
 against excelsior really the latter 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.190
 only finish training today 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.079
 that will help more of course 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.400
 of course you never know right away 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.780
 often a little before the game 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 relax 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.250
 of settlements and finishing but today 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.049
 in the many balls so i hope we will 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.579
 who then take the power of tomorrow 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.660
 find second according to jacket not at one 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.250
 or two players 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.290
 it's for all teams and I think so 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.950
 are quite a few players of which 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.329
 the former was said of yes that 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.920
 they defend a little less or they defend 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.750
 switch badly and I see there 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.300
 everyone now is his stinking best 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.190
 do and 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.200
 yes they will have them I think in the back 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.760
 it is very solid in the construction 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.060
 pretty good with a good football 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.260
 and the keeper and in midfield and that 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.270
 I like that name is not 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.800
 so much called but robbie persists 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.700
 has been with various for years 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.550
 clubs 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.040
 it just a nice tasty left leg 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.270
 midfielder tjen a who may well be one 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.370
 mentioned because is the last one 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.950
 week does something just excellent too 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.420
 so it's not just about the om 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.459
 the front line size swing is about 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.049
 a team of van willem 2 ryan thomas 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.570
 sits against excelsior with a board 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.580
 the side went to train this week join 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.400
 Thomas Lamb who was missing I am very happy 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.440
 because I thought excelsior considering the 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.730
 nature of the injury in the complaints 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.790
 well you can maybe do a few 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.470
 have lost weeks and has 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.180
 rehabilitated first on his own 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.500
 is low we closed the group the went 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.850
 good again today 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.250
 so smother new ones at the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.990
 match selection thomas lamb that got 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.940
 is a tap on his knees on the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.640
 inner tube and that will certainly work tomorrow 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.030
 not pick up and even in Tuesday that is 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.030
 a question mark
