00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.100
 Bolado is a two to a new video 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.930
 well basically I'm going to talk a little 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.790
 of rain man legends of background you go to 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.400
 have also some example of the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.929
 game of some of the levels and such is 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.030
 say first that the game is 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.030
 tremendous and choose levels to teach 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.880
 it's totally difficult because really 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.500
 in which certain are all really 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.690
 fabulous I the truth yesterday was a bit 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.400
 see in other names and such 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.080
 of magazines that gave her so many 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.420
 a lot of notes and good really 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.860
 we always go all the games of 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.930
 platforms and such I have done in several 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.000
 chances and I knew that this game is going to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.980
 be tremendously good but really 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.920
 When I played it, I realized that 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.480
 that is even more is more than what 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.120
 what he really believed in a first 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.649
 place me the truth playing it you give 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.170
 realize that these games become 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.030
 infinite infinity in the sense that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.790
 I'll explain there are lots of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.210
 levels there are also we have also the 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.399
 levels of rayman origins and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.320
 remastered with rain graphics 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.250
 man legends finally with blades 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.460
 new as 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.200
 make some lockable if such or 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.210
 basically we have for the price of 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.860
 barely half worth 40 euros 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.320
 Reduced prices are killed on motorcycles 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.820
 games and because I believe that what is 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.979
 infinite and so good is practically 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.080
 we have a zone of challenges a zone of 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.510
 online challenges in which we have to 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.040
 surpass certain certain things not by 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.760
 example you have subject the number of 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.020
 loops move from this level in this time 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.990
 basically for being retro destination and the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.790
 to make more score or less time and 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.130
 this kind of thing then get a 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.840
 Silver or gold bronze medal not 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.960
 the first places to receive 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.850
 logically gold medal others 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.899
 places for silver and the others 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.630
 the bronze 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.729
 basically it's the first one you do not go 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.160
 and will you report something or not I think that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.920
 they will give it to you in the form of light and such and 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.840
 well basically me yesterday for example 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.700
 that you first in the challenge first not 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.320
 get a gold medal in the rest of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.330
 of the day because to be first is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.119
 impossible, I'm already assuring you of people 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.310
 that really spend a lot of hours in 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.530
 the challenges this is impossible to be of 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.119
 first two that they should give you but let's go 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.679
 It must be a millionth of light 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.030
 there is a character that really 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.340
 unlock with a million loops 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.799
 basically getting that is a whore 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.569
 initial barbarity very much also 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.250
 we have the weekly challenge and such that good 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.190
 Basically, online challenges are those 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.739
 that every day they propose a challenge 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.140
 different and try to improve ourselves is not 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.970
 something that really makes the game coffee to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.950
 an icon to say it in a way not what 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.709
 makes it unique because every day we have 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.790
 new levels and new challenges over 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.590
 on-line 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.750
 the game because the game is not seen at all 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.730
 finished you have this addition that is 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.660
 tremendous talking a little about the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.269
 theme of the graphics have been improved 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.190
 quite compared to the original now 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.430
 It seems that the bosses have a good 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.260
 3d effect that pretty cool and really 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.120
 everything is much more careful to detail 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.269
 there are many more details there 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.099
 many more unlockables and there it is 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.260
 much harder we could say it 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.790
 you already know that the good version is 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.760
 version was going to be a beginning in a 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.560
 first moment the version of wii 1 of 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.390
 done already upload it and such and good with 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.650
 touch panel did certain things by 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.349
 well, basically, the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.810
 Touch panel with the circle button is not 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.250
 when when we need to move something 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.580
 we give to the circle and I move it 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.690
 automatically something that hinders 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.489
 honestly the water game I spent 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.870
 the same is with the finger and also 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.060
 makes it a little difficult what is the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.250
 playability but really I think that 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.840
 it's pretty good that it's a little bit more 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.930
 difficult that the previous one that supposes a 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.420
 challenge and logically because the origin is 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.160
 being the hole is easier put 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.630
 how good that we do not have powers to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.239
 principle and we 're getting it and 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.349
 this is already law in our fund what 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.019
 that we already have all the power of 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.310
 principle and good the truth that it shows 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.410
 it is not noticeable from the first levels 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.989
 supposes a challenge on everything to contain it 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.069
 everything is more difficult than in horinsa ming 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.140
 is costing you on some levels 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.390
 find certain things I'm going to have to 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.310
 take a look at days because really 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.170
 there are things that I do not find them, not because 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.720
 I say what the hell then we have 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.060
 very many unlockable as I said 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.430
 we have hundreds hundred hundred hundreds 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.890
 and hundreds, that is, the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.980
 amount of creature characters and 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.900
 then we can also as I say portal 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.120
 I notified of 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.120
 how to say it from ticket to water determined 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.769
 you one level and we have to scratch and not 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.350
 they give us different things more levels of 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.090
 origin or I use different things or 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.860
 creatures and such that classically good 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.330
 we do not need all of this to 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.830
 unlock platinum platinum but for 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.990
 example is also pretty enough 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.060
 we do not have to do enough 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.770
 daily challenges then we also have 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.210
 mini-games like a mini soccer game 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.460
 it's also pretty good 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.320
 imagine football in two dimensions or 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.669
 it's pretty pretty good 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.130
 bosses have also improved pretty 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.530
 they are more difficult than the previous ones and 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.840
 it has a little more depth and 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.340
 good musical levels of all kinds in 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.350
 levels at which we have to run 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.090
 escape from the fire I do not know I think this 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.610
 I play the truth 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.280
 lage in magazines and such are being 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.440
 just with the note and he deserves it 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.000
 the generation is quite finished 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.650
 well this one played the truth has 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.050
 impressed quite pretty enough 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.280
 I think that people should try it 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.680
 I should try it because it 's a game 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.110
 totally excellent or at least to me that 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.940
 is what I think 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.040
 when I just did it again 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.050
 another analysis will surely take a long time 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.940
 finish it why I preferred to do 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.320
 first my first impressions because 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.300
 I will load as I say a lot in 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.720
 spend it on completing everything and a 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.980
 constant but for now I do not 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.570
 I recommend everyone to me 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.940
 charming if you can not buy it for 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.010
 at least rent it because they really are 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.450
 hours and hours and hours and hours of 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.220
 fun you can also play in 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.900
 cooperative and such that is pretty good 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.130
 cooperatives I think that the local thing I think 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.890
 that in the multiplayer but good 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.390
 you basically enjoy the same thing just 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.820
 that accompanied I can get to 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.680
 ensure so good nothing more chávez 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.240
 of that progress I liked it and nothing else 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.240
 in the next video until next time
