00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.620
 ok i'm back here enough stick e 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.970
 diamonds to make a nice break 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.650
 chronicles will lead us to see diana perhaps 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.990
 to become not even controlled sir 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.160
 vote no and at least think fortunately 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.090
 otherwise I would have made a figure 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 very bad as usual 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.260
 anyway let's go ahead and see if 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 we can find this this 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.199
 damn obsidian that will be even more 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.250
 hard diamond I think I go into 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:42.750
 depth and find it unless you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.540
 we create ourselves I don't know which ones 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 are the criteria I think it is the go 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.079
 above water give obsidian water war 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 above lava I have to go anyway 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 depth to find it I had found 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.690
 at first I don't even remember the cave 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 where i was sincerely because if 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.850
 the stupid and then in this direction 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 house platt first the caves here and I have not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.190
 found nothing so i went in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960
 this direction 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.200
 Rim seemed to have found that case 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.990
 interesting let's see if that's the case 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.700
 this or that was the place you have 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.590
 perfect which I should find maybe 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.000
 obsidian in a national manner 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.799
 quite easy approved it is not me 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 succeeded this time too first if there is 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:31.200
 I did it I did a super fatah espi 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 I don't know you're idiotic to say the least also 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 came a blow to the heart and quan and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.600
 hardly there is plava for all 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.549
 ice that is there but okay not there 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.469
 will try the same and you will be disappointed e 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.720
 it's not even torches because you're a genius 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.470
 all the col 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.569
 a in the furnaces and cyan zombies follows you 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.750
 as never taken from the zombie by so 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:55.020
 took it apologetically hid nearby 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.159
 ok i saw some lava i saw the lamal 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.860
 in there the lava of the val at the top where 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.729
 you're lava, though, of having seen 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.289
 of the obsidian before where I had seen it 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:16.430
 give the hallucinations palmenti ok maybe 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.430
 the penalty is both obsidian 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:28.260
 excellent heskey you have found the victory 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.840
 ok you don't die don't do them or deny them 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.950
 amazed cross can kill himself driving north 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.290
 rock 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.599
 okay anyway then we can 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 finally get our obsidian 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.629
 and go on we must make a chant 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.569
 in the wall audio take a look at ours 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.010
 beautiful achievements because I don't know if 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.049
 you know but I'm doing all this for 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.459
 the achievements are delayed then 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.950
 excuse achievement center santin table 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.019
 is a portal for the network is fine 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.879
 portal to never do with wait 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.370
 at 46 to 10 in theory, perhaps even blocks 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.980
 with less but with more 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.859
 sorry I ca n't do 10 10 yes to the number 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.250
 necessary to make the minimum the minimum 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.260
 necessary to make the portal for the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.379
 cock so now we'll have to get a nice one 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.700
 bit of blocks I have no active here 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.470
 they will want a regent century this 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.370
 I will cut brutally st part because 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.709
 I guess nobody likes it 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.260
 wait while you dig this 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.319
 black crap 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.000
 aoodgai we are back now let us dedicate ourselves 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.370
 finally the enchanting crafting 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.959
 and then to bring Christmas then 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.120
 then meanwhile giant in the poll 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:41.030
 how can I forgive you in mind 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.099
 with a book talk sky with gods 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.190
 diamonds and kone in the best too many is 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:51.079
 excellent obsidian obsidian 4 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.519
 excellent book hare books books books 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.930
 books and now you do with the skin with the 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.150
 card unless you have some of it 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.579
 stock so just for fun maybe ne 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.220
 I could have someone I picked up or 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:05.720
 I don't know what kind of a cheap page 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.379
 I need I'll find books 0 christ case 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.980
 anything 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.780
 ok no books not enchanted anyway 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.010
 I have to deal on my own is for 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.379
 capturing these things are needed 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.320
 sugarcanes I think to get the card 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.639
 then with the paper and the skin are made i 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:31.639
 books those weak scratches baban frame 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:33.580
 three sheets of paper how it works ok 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:40.430
 we find out that I discovered four 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:43.099
 top three is such or blank factor 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.039
 ok no ok so between papers is one thing 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.470
 not at all like that and bam 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.220
 here is a perfect book excellent excellent 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.680
 great where you are 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.880
 He threw it whenever something jean en 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.289
 table 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.289
 we have a book at the top 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.520
 jean while ok a book at the top we have 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:09.800
 to do from to place we have two 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.169
 diamond we have obsidian and well 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.569
 lance mind flies this point this me 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.699
 it is advisable to place it near the away 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.009
 I put the practical anvil in it 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.139
 misery is late then we do 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.020
 so I put it here at the center because of me 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.460
 it seems that we should leave a space of 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.099
 a block around 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.599
 ok let's do so we agree not 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.229
 in the meantime we will fix the maximum amount 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.689
 let's do like this 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.000
 great the game you should should 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.439
 be great 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.719
 here we can sing them but things and 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.009
 I don't know what the hell it is doing 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.439
 he will learn sooner or later 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.449
 sooner or later I'll be able to do things now 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.550
 what we need to do is go to 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.650
 create the portal for ned 15 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.150
 we need a lighter we have here 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.889
 oh my god we really have it 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.750
 turn it on we hope for a real fire there 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.490
 our house meanwhile then the 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.650
 portal for the never sincerely I would like 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.969
 do a little away from home and in a place more 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.919
 protected as they could sound 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.310
 mobs so today a mind from mine 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.650
 to make it happen I would like to do it below 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.789
 maybe right here is this place 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.240
 perfect 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.800
 apart from that 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.639
 then it seems to me that two go on top ok 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.870
 then it seems to me that they go 1 2 and 3 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.819
 don't tell me I miss the blocks 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.139
 necessary don't tell me I have to go back in 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.460
 that hell best one of those 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.650
 in iron I do it offline and then I do it 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:33.210
 I say ok we just need the pieces because I have 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:37.229
 doubted that they also concealed 4 and 1 2 and 3 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:40.280
 so it must be good eg 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.280
 hey but we don't have the 5 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:50.230
 I made the portal for the ned why 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.770
 you didn't tell me they can enter the 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.770
 m ok 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.580
 wait for me i already did a little for the 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.330
 lED 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.400
 okay time ago ok you got the top 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.180
 there are strategists after I will watch them 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.180
 another time 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.740
 so in the next few episodes there 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.970
 we will dedicate to the other achievements 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.530
 so we will proceed with obvious that 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.270
 you need to do a heart of damage with a 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.590
 I do not know a single blow I think I need to 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.360
 enchant a sword I don't think the 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.310
 our shoulders enchanted diamond suffice 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.740
 for this thing we will see then must 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.200
 create book chances for 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:33.430
 improve the throwing in chad monkey 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.170
 ball you have to kill a cast with one 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.890
 fine firewalls when you shoot us with 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:41.350
 the sword push them back and into the 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.180
 fire kill blaze tele roda 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.560
 etcetera etc. etc. therefore in i 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.120
 next episodes we will continue this 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.450
 because of achievements and we will try to 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.100
