00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.009 
of makes me sad
but<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.670> from<00:00:11.880> pypes<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.420> caribbean

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
but this is from pypes of the caribbean

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.919 
but this is from pypes of the caribbean
this<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.620> Captain<00:00:14.130> Jack<00:00:14.429> Sparrow<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.179> as<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
this is Captain Jack Sparrow and as you

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.170 
this is Captain Jack Sparrow and as you
can<00:00:16.049> see<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.800> face<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> little<00:00:17.580> bit<00:00:17.670> odd<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
can see the face is a little bit odd and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.720 
can see the face is a little bit odd and
that<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.160> supposed<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.670> be

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
that is because this is supposed to be

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.720 
that is because this is supposed to be
the<00:00:21.000> voodoo<00:00:21.390> ones<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> voodoo<00:00:23.039> doll<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the voodoo ones like the voodoo doll and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.990 
the voodoo ones like the voodoo doll and
I<00:00:24.449> think<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:25.019> cool<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> set<00:00:26.849> number

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
I think it's very cool it is set number

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.320 
I think it's very cool it is set number
three<00:00:27.539> zero<00:00:27.840> one<00:00:28.140> three<00:00:28.380> two<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:30.029> believe

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
three zero one three two and I believe

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.150 
three zero one three two and I believe
that<00:00:30.359> polybag<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.410> available<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.949> few

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that polybag was available a few

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.580 
that polybag was available a few
different<00:00:32.489> ways<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.120> think<00:00:33.960> that's<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.469> one

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
different ways I think that's the one

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
different ways I think that's the one
that<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.920> got<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> pre-ordered<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.329> Lego

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that you got if you pre-ordered the Lego

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
that you got if you pre-ordered the Lego
Pirates<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> Caribbean<00:00:37.559> video<00:00:38.160> game<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
Pirates of the Caribbean video game I

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420 
Pirates of the Caribbean video game I
think<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.690> was<00:00:39.840> also<00:00:40.170> available<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.920> Toys<00:00:41.190> R<00:00:41.370> Us

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
think it was also available at Toys R Us

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.200 
think it was also available at Toys R Us
and<00:00:41.940> maybe<00:00:42.750> another<00:00:43.320> place<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.770> two<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and maybe another place or two but I

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.479 
and maybe another place or two but I
think<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.110> pretty<00:00:46.260> cool

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
think it's pretty cool

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.240 
think it's pretty cool
this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.440> piracy<00:00:49.440> Caribbean<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:49.980> kind<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
this is piracy Caribbean was kind of
special<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> me<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
special to me because it was kind of the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
special to me because it was kind of the
first<00:00:52.260> sets<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.460> started<00:00:54.239> reviewing<00:00:54.570> on

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
my own so if you look at my old parts of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.510 
my own so if you look at my old parts of
Caribbean<00:00:57.539> reviews<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.280> they're

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
Caribbean reviews you can see they're

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.389 
Caribbean reviews you can see they're
not<00:01:00.270> done<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.840> well<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.190> were<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
not done as well because they were the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.679 
not done as well because they were the
first<00:01:02.430> videos<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.570> did<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:03.930> own<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:06.210> anyway

I think this is a really awesome figure
and<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.040> polybag<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> only<00:01:11.820> way<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> can

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.090 
some nice little details on the back
there<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.780> think<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.860> cool

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.289 
there I think this is a really cool
figure<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.540> never<00:01:27.990> reviewed<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.909> back<00:01:29.909> when

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
figure and I never reviewed it back when

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.020 
figure and I never reviewed it back when
I<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.540> doing<00:01:30.600> all<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> other<00:01:31.229> sets<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I was doing all the other sets so I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.760 
I was doing all the other sets so I
thought<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.450> would<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.720> cool<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.470> ahead<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
thought it would be cool to go ahead and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.520 
thought it would be cool to go ahead and
review<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.280> guys<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:35.729> because<00:01:36.659> it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
review it for you guys now because it's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
review it for you guys now because it's
just<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.860> awesome<00:01:38.159> little<00:01:38.310> figure<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.290> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
just a awesome little figure and you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
just a awesome little figure and you
know<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.400> people<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:42.030> probably

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
know I think some people have probably

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.569 
know I think some people have probably
forgotten<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:43.049> prized<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> Caribbean<00:01:44.159> set

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
forgotten about prized the Caribbean set

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
forgotten about prized the Caribbean set
but<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:46.049> were<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.439> awesome<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.100> they

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
but they were really awesome when they

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.899 
but they were really awesome when they
were<00:01:47.280> released<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.409> I<00:01:49.409> don't<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> big

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
were released and I don't know I'm a big

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.539 
were released and I don't know I'm a big
fan<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.770> they're<00:01:53.009> coming<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.399> with

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
fan and I think they're coming out with

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.429 
fan and I think they're coming out with
another<00:01:53.579> pirates<00:01:54.299> movie<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.810> another<00:01:55.079> year<00:01:55.380> or

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
another pirates movie in another year or
