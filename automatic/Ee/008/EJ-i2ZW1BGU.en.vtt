00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
the difference in the orders this video

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.630 
the difference in the orders this video
here<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.559> specifically<00:00:55.190> going<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.489> be<00:00:55.550> about

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
here is specifically going to be about

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.309 
here is specifically going to be about
sound<00:00:56.089> and<00:00:56.390> hearing<00:00:59.170> there's<00:01:00.170> some

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
sound and hearing there's some

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:01.899 
sound and hearing there's some
techniques<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.859> we<00:01:01.039> can<00:01:01.190> use<00:01:01.219> to<00:01:01.699> improve

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
techniques that we can use to improve

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.049 
techniques that we can use to improve
our<00:01:02.329> hearing<00:01:03.400> one<00:01:04.400> thing<00:01:04.430> if<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.760> have<00:01:04.879> long

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
our hearing one thing if you have long

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.610 
our hearing one thing if you have long
hair<00:01:05.089> thats<00:01:05.449> hanging<00:01:05.570> up<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:05.840> your<00:01:05.900> ears<00:01:06.140> you

hair thats hanging up in your ears you
won't<00:01:06.830> believe<00:01:06.979> how<00:01:07.250> much<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.700> difference

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
won't believe how much of a difference

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.160 
won't believe how much of a difference
that<00:01:08.570> makes<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.110> blocking<00:01:09.560> out<00:01:09.650> sound<00:01:09.920> so

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
that makes and blocking out sound so

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.430 
that makes and blocking out sound so
keep<00:01:12.170> your<00:01:12.260> hair<00:01:12.470> back<00:01:13.780> let's<00:01:14.780> go<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.200> great

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
keep your hair back let's go is a great

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.370 
keep your hair back let's go is a great

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
example here my good boy the dog is wore

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.910 
example here my good boy the dog is wore
out<00:01:18.410> from<00:01:18.590> our<00:01:18.890> dais<00:01:19.190> women<00:01:20.530> dogs<00:01:21.530> know<00:01:21.740> how<00:01:21.860> to

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
out from our dais women dogs know how to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.300 
out from our dais women dogs know how to
triangulate<00:01:22.340> sound<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.210> pinpoint<00:01:23.870> sound

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
triangulate sound and pinpoint sound

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.960 
triangulate sound and pinpoint sound
automatically<00:01:25.310> we<00:01:25.730> have<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.210> learn

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
automatically we have to learn

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
automatically we have to learn
some<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.170> already<00:01:28.440> know<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
some of you will already know this and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.150 
some of you will already know this and
be<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.640> that's<00:01:30.210> common<00:01:30.570> sense<00:01:30.600> duh<00:01:31.320> some<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
be like that's common sense duh some of

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.570 
be like that's common sense duh some of
you<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.910> me<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:34.100> you'll<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.370> why

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
you are like me and you'll be like why

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.980 
you are like me and you'll be like why
didn't<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.910> think<00:01:35.940> of<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.300> which<00:01:36.660> is<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
didn't I think of that which is what I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.460 
didn't I think of that which is what I
did<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.560> someone<00:01:38.070> taught<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.320> okay<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
did when someone taught me this okay the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.940 
did when someone taught me this okay the
technique<00:01:40.800> for<00:01:40.950> increasing<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.580> hearing<00:01:42.030> is

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
technique for increasing your hearing is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.820 
technique for increasing your hearing is
simple<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> dog<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:46.110> pointy<00:01:46.530> ears

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
simple just like a dog you pointy ears

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.730 
simple just like a dog you pointy ears
up<00:01:47.160> cup<00:01:47.790> your<00:01:47.880> hands<00:01:48.030> behind<00:01:48.240> your<00:01:48.450> ears<00:01:48.740> point

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
up cup your hands behind your ears point

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.330 
up cup your hands behind your ears point
your<00:01:49.860> ears<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.700> cut<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.890> increase

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
your ears out and cut you just increase

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.600 
your ears out and cut you just increase
the<00:01:53.460> size<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.060> ears<00:01:54.800> now<00:01:55.800> all<00:01:56.190> these

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the size of your ears now all these

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.200 
the size of your ears now all these
sounds<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.450> much<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:57.960> vivid<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
sounds are so much more vivid but to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.609 
sounds are so much more vivid but to
triangulate<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:00.960> sound<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> still<00:02:01.470> have

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
triangulate that sound you still have

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.719 
triangulate that sound you still have
the<00:02:01.710> problem<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.160> not<00:02:02.310> being<00:02:02.580> able<00:02:02.640> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the problem of not being able to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
the problem of not being able to
pinpoint<00:02:03.000> sound<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.840> I'm<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.170> funny<00:02:04.350> thing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
pinpoint sound so I'm just a funny thing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
pinpoint sound so I'm just a funny thing
like<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.800> it's<00:02:05.100> hard<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> pinpoint<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:06.300> can

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
like that it's hard to pinpoint you can

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.609 
like that it's hard to pinpoint you can
hear<00:02:06.600> something<00:02:06.960> you're<00:02:07.080> like<00:02:07.200> oh<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.500> over

not sure well here's how you can be sure
where<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.290> great<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.620> like<00:02:13.740> bird

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
where it is it's great for like bird

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.360 
where it is it's great for like bird

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
head he cocked his head you point one

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.290 
head he cocked his head you point one
ear<00:02:26.910> down<00:02:27.530> that's<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.650> we're<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.950> do

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
ear down that's what we're going to do

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.370 
ear down that's what we're going to do
so<00:02:31.400> cup<00:02:32.400> our<00:02:32.550> ears<00:02:32.780> move<00:02:33.780> around<00:02:33.989> till<00:02:34.290> we

pinpointed until we point out you down

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.580 
pinpointed until we point out you down
to<00:02:40.920> point<00:02:41.130> your<00:02:41.220> ear<00:02:41.400> down<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:42.290> don't<00:02:43.290> know<00:02:43.380> why

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
it works it just does and then try it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.870 
it works it just does and then try it
again<00:02:46.860> your<00:02:47.010> head<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.250> way<00:02:47.430> point<00:02:47.760> your
