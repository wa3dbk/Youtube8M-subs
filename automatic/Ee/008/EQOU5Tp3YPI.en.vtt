in<00:01:56.409> place<00:01:56.469> you'll<00:01:56.950> realize<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.340> there's

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
in place you'll realize that there's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.370 
in place you'll realize that there's
gonna<00:01:57.849> be<00:01:58.029> a<00:01:58.060> little<00:01:58.239> bit<00:01:58.419> of<00:01:58.509> bowing<00:01:58.899> or<00:01:59.319> a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
gonna be a little bit of bowing or a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.870 
gonna be a little bit of bowing or a
little<00:01:59.649> bit<00:01:59.739> of<00:01:59.859> rocking<00:02:00.099> back<00:02:00.459> and<00:02:00.489> forth

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
little bit of rocking back and forth

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.249 
little bit of rocking back and forth
what<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.239> ends<00:02:01.450> up<00:02:01.539> being<00:02:01.719> is<00:02:01.899> even<00:02:02.169> though

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
what that ends up being is even though

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.929 
what that ends up being is even though
it<00:02:02.380> may<00:02:02.499> look<00:02:02.529> like<00:02:03.099> you've<00:02:03.520> got<00:02:03.759> everything

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
it may look like you've got everything

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.149 
it may look like you've got everything
seated<00:02:04.659> right<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.139> gonna<00:02:05.289> rock<00:02:05.590> back<00:02:05.950> and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
seated right it's gonna rock back and

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.139 
seated right it's gonna rock back and
forth<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.489> what<00:02:06.579> you're<00:02:06.700> going<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.849> need<00:02:07.029> to

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
forth and what you're going to need to

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.560 
forth and what you're going to need to
do<00:02:07.299> is<00:02:07.450> make<00:02:07.599> sure<00:02:07.630> all<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.590> edges<00:02:08.740> are

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
do is make sure all the edges are

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.760 
do is make sure all the edges are
snapped<00:02:10.570> in<00:02:10.840> place<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.320> there<00:02:11.680> is

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
snapped in place so that there is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.670 
snapped in place so that there is
actually<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.250> ridge<00:02:12.760> around<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.960> actual<00:02:14.380> key

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
actually a ridge around the actual key

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.110 
actually a ridge around the actual key
bored<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.250> you're<00:02:15.370> gonna<00:02:15.459> see<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.819> little

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
bored so you're gonna see this little

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.449 
bored so you're gonna see this little
small<00:02:16.390> Ridge<00:02:16.689> around<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.469> keyboard<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.159> that

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
small Ridge around the keyboard and that

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.979 
small Ridge around the keyboard and that
will<00:02:18.579> basically<00:02:18.670> tell<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.629> it's

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
will basically tell you that it's

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.780 
will basically tell you that it's
installed<00:02:20.500> properly<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.069> you're<00:02:21.370> gonna<00:02:21.489> get

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
installed properly and you're gonna get

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.690 
installed properly and you're gonna get
that<00:02:22.329> feedback<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.739> none<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.159> rocking

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
that feedback and none of that rocking

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.119 
that feedback and none of that rocking
everything<00:02:25.060> will<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.269> nice<00:02:25.510> flat<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.500> level

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
everything will be nice flat and level

everything will be nice flat and level
for<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.670> use<00:02:28.680> obviously<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.980> power

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
for you to use obviously the power

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.800 
for you to use obviously the power

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
buttons and all the other switches that

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.629 
buttons and all the other switches that
went<00:02:32.049> along<00:02:32.109> with<00:02:32.439> it<00:02:32.469> work<00:02:32.739> perfectly<00:02:33.189> the

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
went along with it work perfectly the

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.000 
went along with it work perfectly the
feedback<00:02:34.090> from<00:02:34.269> them<00:02:34.480> was<00:02:34.629> great<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.680> didn't

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
feedback from them was great it didn't

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.009 
feedback from them was great it didn't
add<00:02:36.129> too<00:02:36.159> much<00:02:36.519> bulk<00:02:36.849> obviously<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:37.930> gonna

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
add too much bulk obviously it's gonna

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.899 
add too much bulk obviously it's gonna
have<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.319> give<00:02:39.219> you<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> little<00:02:39.609> bit<00:02:39.760> more

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
have to give you a little bit more

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.670 
have to give you a little bit more
rigidity<00:02:40.239> than<00:02:40.629> other<00:02:40.930> products<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.590> you

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
rigidity than other products that you

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.619 
rigidity than other products that you
may<00:02:41.920> see<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.310> market<00:02:42.519> they're<00:02:43.359> just

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
may see on the market they're just

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.569 
may see on the market they're just
essentially<00:02:44.049> tubes<00:02:44.349> or<00:02:44.620> plastic<00:02:45.129> tubes<00:02:45.370> that

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
essentially tubes or plastic tubes that

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.080 
essentially tubes or plastic tubes that
lock<00:02:45.819> in<00:02:46.030> both<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.200> two<00:02:47.519> wireless<00:02:48.519> devices

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
lock in both of the two wireless devices

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.119 
lock in both of the two wireless devices
but<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.659> one<00:02:49.810> gave<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.290> best<00:02:50.500> rigidity<00:02:50.980> at

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
but this one gave the best rigidity at

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.759 
but this one gave the best rigidity at
least<00:02:51.310> stiffness<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.419> durability<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:53.200> I

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
least stiffness and durability that I

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.879 
least stiffness and durability that I
was<00:02:53.950> looking<00:02:54.189> for<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.709> obviously<00:02:56.709> it

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
was looking for so and obviously it

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.789 
was looking for so and obviously it
looks<00:02:57.040> pretty<00:02:57.609> good<00:02:58.049> overall<00:02:59.049> really<00:02:59.500> cool
