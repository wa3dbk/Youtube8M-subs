use I thought I would get another pair
something<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> could<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.090> know

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
some hiking and the biggest thing was I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
some hiking and the biggest thing was I
wanted<00:01:02.940> something<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> had<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.619> bit

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
wanted something that had a little bit

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.160 
wanted something that had a little bit
more<00:01:04.979> heel<00:01:05.430> cushion<00:01:05.970> than<00:01:06.119> five<00:01:06.810> fingers

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
more heel cushion than five fingers

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
offer but also closer to a zero drop

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.380 
offer but also closer to a zero drop
then<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:11.189> know<00:01:11.310> most<00:01:11.520> shoes<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.060> find

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
then you know most shoes that you find

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.660 
then you know most shoes that you find
out<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:15.210> trails<00:01:16.250> looked<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.520> me<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
out there and the trails looked to me a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
out there and the trails looked to me a
lot<00:01:17.909> better<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> roads<00:01:20.960> figured<00:01:21.960> these

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
lot better than the roads figured these

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:22.940 
lot better than the roads figured these
would<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.619> bit<00:01:22.799> more

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
would just be a little bit more

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.940 
would just be a little bit more
versatile<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.150> sole<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.200> also<00:01:25.740> made

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
versatile the sole on these is also made

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.690 
versatile the sole on these is also made
by<00:01:26.159> vibram<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> lot<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
by vibram so you know you get a lot of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
by vibram so you know you get a lot of
the<00:01:30.030> same<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.329> flexion<00:01:34.400> haven't<00:01:35.400> run<00:01:35.520> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the same you know flexion haven't run in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
the same you know flexion haven't run in
them<00:01:35.759> yet<00:01:36.030> probably<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:37.110> give<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> try

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
them yet probably will give it a try

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.080 
them yet probably will give it a try
because<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.250> feel<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.670> light<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
because they just feel so light on the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
because they just feel so light on the
foot<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.960> imagine<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> road<00:01:40.920> feel<00:01:41.280> we're

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
foot but I imagine the road feel we're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.830 
foot but I imagine the road feel we're
going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.860> pretty<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:44.070> what<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.250> expect

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
going to be pretty much what you expect

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.830 
going to be pretty much what you expect
better<00:01:45.840> than<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.470> standard<00:01:47.100> running<00:01:47.399> shoe<00:01:47.840> not

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
better than a standard running shoe not

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.920 
better than a standard running shoe not
as<00:01:48.990> good<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.290> five<00:01:49.740> fingers<00:01:50.899> probably<00:01:51.899> i

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
as good as the five fingers probably i

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.420 
as good as the five fingers probably i
would<00:01:52.079> guess<00:01:52.320> somewhere<00:01:52.619> kind<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
would guess somewhere kind of like a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.139 
would guess somewhere kind of like a
racing<00:01:53.729> flat<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.329> far<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.750> how<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:54.990> feel<00:01:56.149> I've

socks<00:02:00.259> with<00:02:01.259> stocks<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.710> definitely<00:02:01.920> feel<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
socks with stocks they definitely feel a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
socks with stocks they definitely feel a
little<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.610> little<00:02:03.420> tight<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.020> forefoot

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.060 
area you've got this band
but<00:02:07.750> i<00:02:08.729> think<00:02:09.729> is<00:02:09.970> designed<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:11.860> just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
but i think is designed to kind of just

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but i think is designed to kind of just
keep<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.940> tight<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.020> your<00:02:14.140> foot<00:02:14.940> more<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.030> a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
keep it tight on your foot more of a

my<00:02:23.410> foot<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.830> mean<00:02:24.010> if<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.340> got<00:02:24.670> kind<00:02:24.970> of

wide<00:02:25.150> feet<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.690> could<00:02:25.990> be<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.230> issue<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
wide feet so that could be the issue it

wearing with socks sometimes not we'll

see<00:02:47.530> what<00:02:47.710> works<00:02:47.920> I've<00:02:48.730> got<00:02:48.880> some<00:02:49.120> injinji

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
see what works I've got some injinji

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.180 
see what works I've got some injinji
socks<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:50.110> I'm<00:02:50.230> going<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> give<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> go<00:02:50.830> in

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
socks that I'm going to give a go in

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.750 
socks that I'm going to give a go in
these<00:02:51.430> two<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.880> see<00:02:51.970> how<00:02:52.060> those<00:02:52.240> feel<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
these two and see how those feel the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.670 
these two and see how those feel the
inner<00:02:54.970> liner<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.720> can't<00:02:56.260> really<00:02:56.380> see<00:02:56.650> it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
inner liner you can't really see it

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.620 
inner liner you can't really see it
right<00:02:56.980> now<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.700> inner<00:02:57.880> liner<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.390> nice

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
right now but the inner liner is nice

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.510 
right now but the inner liner is nice
and<00:02:58.810> soft<00:02:59.050> on<00:02:59.230> your<00:02:59.350> foot<00:02:59.590> there's<00:02:59.890> no<00:03:00.070> points

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
and soft on your foot there's no points

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.800 
and soft on your foot there's no points
that<00:03:00.670> are<00:03:01.920> sharp<00:03:02.920> or<00:03:03.420> edges<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.780> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
that are sharp or edges like that I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.930 
that are sharp or edges like that I
think<00:03:04.990> they<00:03:05.260> really<00:03:05.620> designed<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:06.760> with

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
think they really designed it with

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.480 
think they really designed it with
wearing<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.480> barefoot<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:07.990> mind<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:09.100> toe<00:03:09.310> box

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490

amazing how light they feel on your foot
I'm<00:04:04.900> definitely<00:04:05.110> going<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.500> give<00:04:05.620> running<00:04:05.830> and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
I'm definitely going to give running and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.300 
I'm definitely going to give running and
these<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.130> try<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.850> think<00:04:07.980> I'm<00:04:08.980> not<00:04:09.130> going<00:04:09.250> to

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
these a try and I think I'm not going to

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.949 
these a try and I think I'm not going to
go<00:04:09.430> away<00:04:09.550> from<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.150> five<00:04:10.420> fingers<00:04:10.630> but<00:04:10.930> I

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
go away from the five fingers but I

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.590 
go away from the five fingers but I
think<00:04:11.230> these<00:04:11.380> could<00:04:11.650> be<00:04:11.860> days<00:04:12.730> where<00:04:13.000> maybe<00:04:13.180> my

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
think these could be days where maybe my

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.870 
think these could be days where maybe my
feet<00:04:13.810> are<00:04:13.930> hurting<00:04:14.080> or

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
got a little longer distance or the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.740 
got a little longer distance or the
weather<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.550> not<00:04:17.670> great<00:04:17.880> these<00:04:18.300> might<00:04:18.540> be<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
weather is not great these might be a

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.370
