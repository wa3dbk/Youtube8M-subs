00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello friends with you evgeny trot 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.940
 with great pleasure I invite everyone 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.010
 you tomorrow to stream dedicated to our 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 project in our beloved game 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 maykravt most diverse mods 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.609
 this time we have prepared for you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 Natalia is a big surprise and want to give 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.539
 you can choose that project 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.640
 which has the most interest 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.920
 and on and a lot of audience attention 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 so now I will show you all three 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 options for which you can 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 vote and not only vote 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.780
 but write exactly what you would like 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.320
 see tomorrow during the stream so 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 The first option is our favorite 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.350
 brutal industrial build 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 engineers against monsters in which we 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.899
 developing Greg those building different 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.300
 architectural projects but periodically and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.010
 happens and plus more on the server and this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.559
 means we have a bunch of players with 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.219
 interesting bases and large-scale 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.010
 buildings so if you choose 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.719
 options engineer against monsters this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.609
 mean we can either do 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.589
 finally with the top three of our base because 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.600
 that our project is very big 100 waist 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.549
 but it is not built yet yes it wasnâ€™t 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 time now we can this time 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.260
 find either instead of building we can 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.020
 do industrial co and now 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.420
 I have a whole bunch of electric cars 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.400
 ready even more machines are not ready them 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.439
 I need to craft I have enough 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.720
 many resources many become 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.670
 I you remember in the last series increased 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740
 number of stoves so yes you can 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 engage in the development of industrial ki 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.570
 wonderful but or make great 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.299
 tour of our server 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.820
 pass to see their player base can 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.759
 be there somehow and interactive exchange 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.229
 chat messages are generally cool 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.229
 this is option number one 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.030
 second project friends is ours 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 wonderful brutal ultra 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.220
 hardcore and bloody antique build 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.020
 blasts on which we are writing 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.119
 letsplay we have such a newcomer to our 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.180
 project but nonetheless he was warm 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.729
 greeted by the audience great interest here and 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.330
 the assembly itself also challenges not 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.950
 only by monsters but because of the marginal 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.019
 the complexity of some craft that you 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.360
 still have to do so up 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.459
 interesting build on it is also possible 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.910
 many things to show and for your choice 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.739
 there will be an expansion of the underground base 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.140
 building industrial kinat learn a lot 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.480
 than you can build a passage 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.190
 quests we have only so far but you can 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.769
 say that the very beginning because 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.260
 that we are now only 29 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.730
 percent 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.269
 first branch getting started generally on 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.980
 this is a 161 quad map of all of them we 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.319
 passed 15 that kind of symbolizes 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.720
 great interesting way but i suppose so 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.180
 that as we had successfully passed thefts 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.160
 landing attack this map we will pass I 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.829
 I hope that is not cooked here 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.170
 surprises and type prepare us 64 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.239
 million kabul 100th on that's why 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.940
 if you are interested in this assembly then 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.560
 It is possible too, or is built or 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.690
 complete quests or go to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 adventures because yes we have there 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.370
 revenge all that will be we there by 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.320
 fought of course but we are full of desire 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.540
 go back and continue 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.799
 that's why if you like blasts 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.840
 write about it in the comments 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.680
 suggest that you want to see it 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.680
 also possible 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.920
 Well, these are friends, too, do not say in words 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.250
 this is over mega epic ultra long term 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.510
 to glory radiant longest project 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.860
 in the history of civilization 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.680
 the gigantic gulf he is shorter in the world 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.280
 friends are agrarian Skies yes yes the very 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.670
 brutal complex assembly that we 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.650
 We have been going through several years already 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.650
 years that we are not yet so 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.480
 the vest will pass lightning beat you 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.490
 the eyes are actually destroying our base 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.130
 our industrial co plows for 100 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.930
 percent card tosses 30 fps in 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.460

 final we have already closed a lot with us than 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.920
 brag but we still have 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.120

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.190
 especially signed shook us there promised 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.760

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.800
 250000 forest drones whether even more 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.990
