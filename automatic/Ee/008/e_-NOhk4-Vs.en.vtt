host<00:01:09.840> migrations<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.799> game<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.369> my

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
host migrations in one game this is my

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.800 
host migrations in one game this is my
first<00:01:11.790> every<00:01:12.180> time<00:01:12.360> having<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> host

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
first every time having the host

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.359 
first every time having the host
migration<00:01:13.020> after<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.740> patch<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.189> get

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
three of them and then after that I kept

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.710 
three of them and then after that I kept
lagging<00:01:17.369> everywhere<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> last<00:01:18.450> five

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
lagging everywhere if like the last five

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.660 
lagging everywhere if like the last five
matches<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:19.530> my<00:01:19.650> search<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> best<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
matches I put my search is the best I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.219

was<00:01:20.790> still<00:01:21.000> lagging<00:01:21.210> absolutely<00:01:21.840> everywhere

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
was still lagging absolutely everywhere

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.780 
was still lagging absolutely everywhere
and<00:01:22.799> I'm<00:01:22.860> pretty<00:01:22.979> sure<00:01:23.130> I've<00:01:23.250> never<00:01:23.280> three

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and I'm pretty sure I've never three

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
and I'm pretty sure I've never three
barred<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.299> anything<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.990> ps3<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.710> and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
off this game was incredibly easy at the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.720 
off this game was incredibly easy at the
beginning<00:02:21.470> people<00:02:21.950> were<00:02:22.160> dropping<00:02:22.280> toner

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
beginning people were dropping toner

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.760

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
are thinking that's the standard

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.820 
are thinking that's the standard
nowadays<00:02:26.720> cuz<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> lot<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.350> people<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.710> playing

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
200-plus is what we're playing two

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.240 
200-plus is what we're playing two
hundred<00:02:29.780> pluses<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.620> that's<00:02:30.770> pretty<00:02:30.950> much<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
hundred pluses so that's pretty much the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.890 
hundred pluses so that's pretty much the
standard<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.700> YouTube<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.510> moment

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
standard of YouTube it at the moment

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.350

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
right now so now since total pluses are

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.850 
right now so now since total pluses are
pretty<00:02:35.570> much<00:02:35.660> impossible<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.440> don't<00:02:36.590> even<00:02:36.680> know

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860

anymore I know everyone that had a 200

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.720 
anymore I know everyone that had a 200
plus<00:03:18.170> record<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.709> guy<00:03:18.830> had<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> highest<00:03:19.160> kts

like<00:03:20.000> here<00:03:20.180> as<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.420> world's<00:03:20.690> highest<00:03:20.780> kills<00:03:21.200> I

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
like here as the world's highest kills I

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.140 
like here as the world's highest kills I
don't<00:03:22.250> think<00:03:22.459> those<00:03:22.550> are<00:03:22.610> ever<00:03:22.880> gonna<00:03:23.030> be

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
don't think those are ever gonna be

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.940 
don't think those are ever gonna be
broken<00:03:23.600> any<00:03:23.750> more<00:03:23.930> since<00:03:24.140> this<00:03:24.290> nerf<00:03:24.620> because

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
broken any more since this nerf because

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.590 
broken any more since this nerf because
you<00:03:25.070> can't<00:03:25.280> even<00:03:25.459> get<00:03:25.580> tumor<00:03:25.880> plusses<00:03:26.240> anymore

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
you can't even get tumor plusses anymore

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.660 
you can't even get tumor plusses anymore
so<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.020> guess<00:03:27.560> that's<00:03:27.770> pretty<00:03:27.890> good<00:03:28.250> for<00:03:28.459> us<00:03:28.520> on

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
so I guess that's pretty good for us on

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.980 
so I guess that's pretty good for us on
our<00:03:28.700> records<00:03:29.120> on<00:03:29.209> can<00:03:29.360> be<00:03:29.450> broken<00:03:29.630> but<00:03:29.959> we

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
our records on can be broken but we

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.870 
our records on can be broken but we
can't<00:03:30.260> break<00:03:30.470> them<00:03:30.590> again<00:03:30.860> or<00:03:31.070> no<00:03:31.490> one<00:03:31.610> else's

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
can't break them again or no one else's

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.040 
can't break them again or no one else's
because<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> kill<00:03:32.300> streaks<00:03:32.510> are<00:03:32.660> nerfed<00:03:32.900> and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
because the kill streaks are nerfed and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.810 
because the kill streaks are nerfed and
all<00:03:33.200> this<00:03:33.320> stuff<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.800> don't<00:03:33.830> know<00:03:34.190> what<00:03:34.400> davon<00:03:34.790> I
