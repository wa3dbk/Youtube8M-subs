00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.770 
and that's gonna make the trash respawn
pretty<00:00:58.230> much<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
pretty much and if you don't do this the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240 
pretty much and if you don't do this the
trash<00:01:00.989> will<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.320> respond<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:01.949> at<00:01:02.010> least<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
trash will not respond or at least it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
trash will not respond or at least it
didn't<00:01:02.460> respond<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.910> me<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.320> how

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
didn't respond for me and so this is how

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.020 
didn't respond for me and so this is how
you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> trash<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.489> respawn<00:01:05.729> pretty

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you can get the trash to respawn pretty

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.760 
you can get the trash to respawn pretty
much<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.270> many<00:01:06.420> times<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> want<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.470> one

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
much as many times as you want now one

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.050 
much as many times as you want now one
thing<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.950> people<00:01:08.189> might<00:01:08.430> need<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> consider

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
thing that people might need to consider

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
thing that people might need to consider
that<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.360> might<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.830> can

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that you might not know is it you can

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
that you might not know is it you can
only<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> ten<00:01:11.729> times<00:01:11.970> per<00:01:12.060> hour<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
only do this ten times per hour and the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.359 
only do this ten times per hour and the
reason<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.680> an<00:01:13.950> instance

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
reason for that is it's just an instance

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
reason for that is it's just an instance
cap<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.000> Blizzard<00:01:15.299> made<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.259> can't

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
cap that Blizzard made and so you can't

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
cap that Blizzard made and so you can't
kill<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.009> thing<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.369> than<00:01:17.430> ten<00:01:17.700> times<00:01:17.880> an

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
kill this thing more than ten times an

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
kill this thing more than ten times an
hour<00:01:18.150> basically<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.979> it's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
hour basically and so if that's if it's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.490 
hour basically and so if that's if it's
not<00:01:20.250> letting<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.820> that's<00:01:21.270> why<00:01:21.509> also

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
not letting you back in that's why also

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
not letting you back in that's why also
as<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.920> said<00:01:23.130> make<00:01:23.369> sure<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> use<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
as I said make sure that you use on

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.609 
as I said make sure that you use on
normal<00:01:24.330> mode<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.720> heroic<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.470> also

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
normal mode not heroic because that also

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
normal mode not heroic because that also
creates<00:01:26.040> other<00:01:26.159> problems<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.299> terms<00:01:27.509> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
creates other problems now in terms of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
creates other problems now in terms of
actually<00:01:27.900> killing<00:01:28.080> precious<00:01:28.759> it<00:01:29.759> does<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
actually killing precious it does like a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.850 
actually killing precious it does like a
thing<00:01:30.630> called<00:01:30.869> decimate<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.530> takes<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
thing called decimate and it takes you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
thing called decimate and it takes you
down<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> ten<00:01:32.610> percent<00:01:32.790> health<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.810> honestly

anybody at level 100 even level 90
should<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.079> able<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> kill<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.530> without<00:01:37.799> even

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
should be able to kill this without even

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340 
should be able to kill this without even
really<00:01:38.220> any<00:01:38.549> knowledge<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.200> does

now the actual prescience is driven an

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.100 
now the actual prescience is driven an

item it has about a it seemed like the
one<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.409> two<00:01:46.560> percent<00:01:46.740> drop<00:01:47.130> chance<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.939> like

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
one to two percent drop chance and like

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
one to two percent drop chance and like
as<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
as you can see I see there's right a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.710 
as you can see I see there's right a
right<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.670> side<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.240> because

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
right on the side of them because

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
right on the side of them because
apparently<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.649> like

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
apparently this is like it's like

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.980 
apparently this is like it's like
Professor<00:01:53.490> Peter<00:01:53.790> side's<00:01:54.090> dog<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.659> something

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's best in show and so whenever you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.039 
it's best in show and so whenever you
kill<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.479> ahead<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.719> wear<00:02:00.930> the
