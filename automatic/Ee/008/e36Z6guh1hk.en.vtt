 our website that says tricks will

 called tricks for solar dotcom where 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.040
 is the full list all the videos 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.230
 that we have already done and the new ones that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.420
 we are doing and then to be able to see 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.950
 the battery percentage by default 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.739
 normally from the cell we buy it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.770
 new does not show us the percentage 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.690
 the battery appears just like that 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.240
 if we want to see the percentage the battery 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.830
 there are two options one is if the cell phone 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.140
 allows to do it through the options 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.630
 configuration and if the cell phone does not 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.640
 allows and without the need to root 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.100
 we can download an application that we 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.780
 allows to report the battery then 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.040
 this cell if it allows it so 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.860
 we enter here by the option of 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.080
 configuration after entering the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.660
 configuration option let's go here to the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.580
 battery option and we simply give it 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.430
 click here where percentage says the other 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.369
 and here we can see that the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.560
 battery is at 33 percent and so 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.690
 it's easy we can see what the level of 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.060
 cell battery in the case 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.720
 soon you will be seeing in this video 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.350
 and have another version of the wayne giga no 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.210
 the 6 not the ahe 6 10 but another version 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.300
 simple kiki and that they do not have the option of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.979
 configuration simply download the 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.490
 next application they get by the 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.490
 play store 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.850
 and here they write percentage 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 of the battery 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.730
 percentage of the battery as it appears 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.700
 there and back a pinpoint more or 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.980
 eliminate it percentage of the battery with 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.560
 search and here in the application that is 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.010
 very good this application has more than 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.190
 a million downloads that's why 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.810
 I recommend here there are two is above 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.000
 let's see how many downloads 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.340
 has also has a million oa 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.650
 give me back the one that always downloaded 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.410
 is this that is called show percentage 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.960
 of the battery we are going to install it 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.050
 quickly and this what he does is 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.510
 show here on the left side the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.880
 percentage of the battery is a 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.270
 very simple application simply makes 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.750
 what they say 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.190
 it does not do more nor does it less simply not 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.050
 it works in case we have a 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.800
 Huawei that does not show us as central 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.530
 battery we open it and ready 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.900
 we left and as you can see we have 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.260
 two percentages of the battery when the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.200
 left and another one to the right if they want 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.690
 get out of the left you can can 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.790
 disable the application or just 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.690
 enter this click here in the three 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.640
 lines below you have close and ready 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.650
 they only have the one since it's 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.090
