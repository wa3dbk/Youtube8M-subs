00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 so 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 4 Not in the middle in the middle in the middle in the middle in the middle in the middle in the middle in the middle in the middle 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100
 Strike 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 I would like to write that it would be right 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.260
 I say $ 2 because I believe it 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.920
 Then this 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.380
 Single and up to dollar 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
 I hope to be in the afternoon 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.740
 Next w is $ 2 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.940
 The first alternator that I got in Nagakawa is convinced 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:43.910
 is 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.180
 Right or left 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.450
 Furthermore 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.560
 It will be Nikko 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 I will try to play a little 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.080
 How much w is a local chicken 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.240
 If it was introduced now, everyone 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.900
 I would like to quote the same statistical announcement 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 At first please listen slowly each time 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.919
 It looks like this for jr and hi-hat 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.809
 Let's put it in, so please listen 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.280
 I played this way 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.440
 It sounds like noon, but if I do this in reverse 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.609
 Sounds like a beat 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.609
 It will try to play 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.809
 It was a bit strange like I was done this way 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.489
 It sounds like a beat 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.509
 I used the reason I got more 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:04.659
 I think it's good 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.079
 Ride the right hand and move the left hand in steps 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.230
 It sounds like a phrase like Rakuten when extended 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.869
 I will 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 Let's play 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.330
 This time also a slightly deformed version of the ball 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.879
 I want to go through this 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.879
 First of all try it slowly so please listen 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.049
 For example, to the left of what I did 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.989
 Become JAL 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.540
 It will be a rhythm that sounds like a store if you hit it 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.540
 I would like to check this a little early 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.259
 It sounds like this rhythm 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.259
 This time using double patterning 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.959
 But I want to play 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.819
 I would like to introduce 8 minutes 56 seconds to death this time 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.819
 Control equipment please 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.249
 good 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.469
 Woods 2nd 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.219
 Edit h 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.949
 Woods 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.490
 One and one match
