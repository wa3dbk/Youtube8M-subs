00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.900 

wineglass<00:03:04.910> Bay<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:06.130> basically<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.580> big

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
wineglass Bay is basically just a big

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.510 
wineglass Bay is basically just a big
bay<00:03:08.150> like<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.800> it's<00:03:09.980> shaped<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.400> a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
bay like this and it's shaped like a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.850 
bay like this and it's shaped like a
wine<00:03:10.850> guy<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:12.050> reason<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.710> was

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
wine guy and the reason that it was

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.160 
wine guy and the reason that it was
called<00:03:13.160> wine<00:03:13.460> glass<00:03:13.760> day<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.060> believe<00:03:14.480> is

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
called wine glass day I believe is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.410 
called wine glass day I believe is
because<00:03:15.380> when<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.860> early<00:03:16.550> people<00:03:16.940> got<00:03:17.150> here

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
because when the early people got here

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.900 
because when the early people got here
and<00:03:17.570> was<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.930> Whalers<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:19.100> water<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.700> there

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and was the Whalers the water in there

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.810 
and was the Whalers the water in there
was<00:03:20.120> wine<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:21.560> killed<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:22.040> many<00:03:22.160> whales

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
was wine that killed that many whales

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.970 
was wine that killed that many whales
the<00:03:23.060> water<00:03:23.330> turned<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.780> wine<00:03:24.050> and<00:03:24.710> that<00:03:24.860> was

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
the water turned to wine and that was

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
the water turned to wine and that was
why<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.190> was<00:03:25.280> called<00:03:25.550> wineglass<00:03:26.120> bay<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.850> Bay

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
why it was called wineglass bay the Bay

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.780 
why it was called wineglass bay the Bay
of<00:03:29.030> Fires<00:03:29.410> actually<00:03:30.410> goes<00:03:30.620> from<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:31.100> place<00:03:31.400> over

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
of Fires actually goes from a place over

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.030 
of Fires actually goes from a place over
on<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.000> point<00:03:32.240> called<00:03:32.510> Elephant<00:03:32.930> Rock<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.740> it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
on the point called Elephant Rock and it

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.420 
on the point called Elephant Rock and it
goes<00:03:34.220> all<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.490> way<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:36.130> Edison<00:03:37.130> lighthouse

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
goes all the way up to Edison lighthouse

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.090 
goes all the way up to Edison lighthouse
and<00:03:38.000> everywhere<00:03:38.660> in<00:03:38.840> between<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.560> called<00:03:39.740> the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
and everywhere in between is called the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.610 
and everywhere in between is called the
Bay<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.430> Fires<00:03:40.610> now<00:03:41.540> we're<00:03:41.720> within<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.290> Bay<00:03:42.470> of

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
Bay of Fires now we're within the Bay of

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.350 
Bay of Fires now we're within the Bay of
Fires<00:03:42.770> there<00:03:43.220> are<00:03:43.340> little<00:03:43.550> areas<00:03:43.940> called<00:03:44.209> the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
Fires there are little areas called the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.080 
Fires there are little areas called the
gardens<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.200> that's<00:03:45.410> where<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:45.800> are<00:03:45.830> here<00:03:46.370> all

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
gardens and that's where we are here all

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.810 
gardens and that's where we are here all
right<00:03:47.240> and<00:03:47.420> as<00:03:48.380> far<00:03:48.560> as<00:03:48.740> I<00:03:48.860> know<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.459> reason

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
right and as far as I know the reason

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.790 
right and as far as I know the reason
this<00:03:49.940> was<00:03:50.150> called<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.570> gardens<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.530> because

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
this was called the gardens is because

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.970 
this was called the gardens is because
when<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.100> first<00:03:52.310> people<00:03:53.030> came<00:03:53.480> down<00:03:53.980> there

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
when the first people came down there

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.890 
when the first people came down there
was<00:03:55.070> that<00:03:55.160> much<00:03:55.370> sea<00:03:55.730> were<00:03:55.910> floating<00:03:56.360> seaweeds

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
was that much sea were floating seaweeds

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.660 
was that much sea were floating seaweeds
with<00:03:57.140> cords<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.560> gardens<00:03:58.070> because<00:03:58.400> of<00:03:58.580> the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
with cords of gardens because of the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.210 
with cords of gardens because of the
floating<00:03:58.910> gardens<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.660> seaweed<00:04:00.020> that's<00:04:01.010> why

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
floating gardens and seaweed that's why

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.430 
floating gardens and seaweed that's why
and<00:04:02.030> then<00:04:02.150> they've<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:02.660> stripped<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.020> off<00:04:03.140> of

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
and then they've just stripped it off of

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.670 
and then they've just stripped it off of
old<00:04:03.650> units<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.580> then<00:04:04.940> never<00:04:05.060> come<00:04:05.240> back<00:04:05.680> but
