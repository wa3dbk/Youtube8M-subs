that<00:00:41.399> feeling<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:41.940> how<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.300> longer

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that feeling that you know how it longer

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.389 
that feeling that you know how it longer
hungry<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:43.379> absolutely<00:00:43.590> fine<00:00:43.949> to<00:00:44.010> stop

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
hungry that's absolutely fine to stop

eating<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:45.680> my<00:00:46.680> top<00:00:46.890> tip<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.250> about

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
processing one of the things we've got

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.099 
processing one of the things we've got
people<00:00:50.609> trying<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> lose<00:00:51.149> weight<00:00:51.359> is<00:00:51.840> they

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
they can lose perspective on their

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
they can lose perspective on their
achievement<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.230> may<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.440> lost<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.890> few

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039

pounds one week and maybe that slowed
down<00:00:58.039> it's<00:00:59.039> important<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.670> gain<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> overall
