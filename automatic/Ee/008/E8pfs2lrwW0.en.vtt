00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.340
 Hello and welcome to the weather first Knysna hope for sunshine 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.030
 but also to higher temperatures because from southwest comes warm air and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.179
 because that comes from the southwest one sees here for Hamburg on trend also one 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.289
 small scandals 2 humps 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.699
 The British schools go high but not quite as high 16 17 degrees on 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.630
 Weekend then comes a deep that brings a little cooler air again 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.320
 after that it's likely to be 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.290
 that a high-pressure area prevails that is on the one hand quite warm and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.090
 then more often the sun is shining and white comes from the southwest 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.930
 is turkey is that can also be slightly higher for coins slightly higher 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.150
 because even higher temperatures on the weekend already the 22 degrees then 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.070
 the deep 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.370
 but only if the high-pressure area really prevails 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.089
 because really once again a book writes warm air comes 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.920
 even goes up to 23 24 degrees and then there are some really nice ones 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.240
 Autumn days but it will not be that bad next day either 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.120
 otherwise the club could still be quite wet that is 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.239
 The rain of the heavy rains in the east is through it may still be a few 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.320
 Drops give but too much will not fall and in itself it will be tomorrow 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.180
 not so unfriendly now in the east after the East 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.259
 densest cloud fields with light rain neither for the center of Germany 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.620
 dry in the northwest there are the stars to see from time to time as well as 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.570
 in the southwest temperatures set early in the morning mostly at values ​​between 6 and 10 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.550
 Degree in the morning morning then quite often in the northwest 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.079
 Sunshine also south and southwest from and to sunny sections 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.450
 the densest still wanted from Lusatia to the Baltic Sea but 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.150
 just not too much rain in the afternoon is a maximum of a few 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.390
 Drop it should fall then it is always short and it will be 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.280
 especially towards the west quite friendly temperatures rise 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.200
 upgrades between 10 and Gazit the Rhine in the extreme southwest so 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.590
 Towards the Upper Rhine and Upper Rhine and winter is usually only weak 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.200
 from different directions on the Baltic Sea, he is still fresh that envy 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.800
 see what comes in then that brings rain the day after tomorrow comes from the west 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.410
 then one spreads further out of the front system but decays more and more 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.240
 accordingly only a few drops in the south will be 14 already 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.560
 to 18 degrees as I said on the weekend then even higher temperatures 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.839
 some days in the summary now continue with the topic 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.459
 Targets the tantrum and that go into people at Maischberger 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.989
 ending
