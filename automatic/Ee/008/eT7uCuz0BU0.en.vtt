00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
watched lesson number 41 yet I suggest

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.150 
watched lesson number 41 yet I suggest
that<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.110> so<00:00:22.320> before<00:00:22.500> continuing<00:00:23.070> with

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that you do so before continuing with

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
that you do so before continuing with
this<00:00:23.370> lesson<00:00:23.990> for<00:00:24.990> future<00:00:25.320> technical

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
this lesson for future technical

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.320 
this lesson for future technical
exercise<00:00:26.160> lessons<00:00:26.610> I<00:00:26.790> will<00:00:26.910> only<00:00:27.150> be

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
exercise lessons I will only be

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.880 
exercise lessons I will only be
demonstrating<00:00:27.870> through<00:00:28.020> one<00:00:28.230> type<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.500> scale

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
demonstrating through one type of scale

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.479 
demonstrating through one type of scale
by<00:00:29.820> mastering<00:00:30.300> exercises<00:00:30.870> 41<00:00:31.290> through<00:00:31.530> 43<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
by mastering exercises 41 through 43 you

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.799 
by mastering exercises 41 through 43 you
will<00:00:32.610> make<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> process<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.450> transposition

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
will make the process of transposition

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
will make the process of transposition
much<00:00:34.530> more<00:00:34.800> intuitive<00:00:35.249> for<00:00:35.579> future<00:00:35.879> lessons

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
much more intuitive for future lessons

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
much more intuitive for future lessons
first<00:00:37.079> let's<00:00:37.469> identify<00:00:37.589> the<00:00:38.010> harmonic<00:00:38.519> minor

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
first let's identify the harmonic minor

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.759 
first let's identify the harmonic minor
scale<00:00:39.089> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.289> the<00:00:40.410> harmonic

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
scale you can think of the harmonic

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.770 
scale you can think of the harmonic
minor<00:00:40.890> scale<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> major<00:00:41.999> scale<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
minor scale as a major scale with the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.079 
minor scale as a major scale with the
flat<00:00:43.050> third<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.589> a<00:00:43.620> flat<00:00:43.859> 6<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.429> that's<00:00:44.760> easier

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
flat third and a flat 6 if that's easier

00:00:45.089 --> 00:01:02.290 
flat third and a flat 6 if that's easier
for<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:46.640> here's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.760> C<00:00:48.059> harmonic<00:00:48.510> minor<00:00:48.629> scale

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.670 

we<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:03.540> take<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.810> pattern<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.290> practice

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
we will now take the pattern we practice

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
we will now take the pattern we practice
unless<00:01:04.860> number<00:01:05.280> 41<00:01:05.730> through<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.300> harmonic

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
unless number 41 through the harmonic

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.500 
unless number 41 through the harmonic
minor<00:01:06.870> scale<00:01:07.310> our<00:01:08.310> metronome<00:01:08.730> is<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.000> 80<00:01:09.240> beads

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
minor scale our metronome is at 80 beads

00:01:09.510 --> 00:02:08.770 
minor scale our metronome is at 80 beads
to<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.870> half<00:01:10.020> note
