custom<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:07.110> could<00:02:07.259> probably<00:02:07.290> change<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
custom one he could probably change that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.589 
custom one he could probably change that
but<00:02:08.220> we're<00:02:08.700> gonna<00:02:08.849> leave<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.509> now

faithful<00:02:26.069> texture<00:02:26.579> I<00:02:26.760> don't<00:02:26.879> know<00:02:26.939> I<00:02:26.969> used

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
faithful texture I don't know I used

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.209 
faithful texture I don't know I used
that<00:02:27.239> one<00:02:27.420> before<00:02:27.450> because<00:02:28.109> fire<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.010> stuff

that one before because fire and stuff

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.970 
that one before because fire and stuff
like<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.599> it's<00:02:30.599> smaller<00:02:31.469> so<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.769> doesn't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
like that it's smaller so it doesn't

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.170 
like that it's smaller so it doesn't
take<00:02:32.069> up<00:02:32.159> your<00:02:32.280> whole<00:02:32.340> screen<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.000> its

towers so I all right now this one

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.140 
towers so I all right now this one
doesn't<00:02:54.689> work<00:02:55.400> like<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:56.879> then<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.000> was

doesn't work like this and then I was
gonna<00:02:57.269> set<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:57.689> up<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.989> a<00:03:00.290> tee<00:03:01.290> flip-flop<00:03:01.769> and

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
gonna set it up to a tee flip-flop and

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.099 
gonna set it up to a tee flip-flop and
stuff<00:03:02.099> like<00:03:02.219> that<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.629> don't<00:03:03.629> worry<00:03:03.780> about<00:03:03.840> it

I<00:03:04.709> was<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.219> cover<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.549> video<00:03:05.760> that's

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
I was going to cover the video that's

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.170 
I was going to cover the video that's
bit<00:03:06.120> too<00:03:06.239> complicated<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.930> anyways<00:03:07.379> um<00:03:08.180> it's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
bit too complicated so anyways um it's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.399 
bit too complicated so anyways um it's
probably<00:03:09.419> not<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.689> call<00:03:09.840> me<00:03:09.959> headforemost<00:03:10.139> you

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
probably not to call me headforemost you

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.949 
probably not to call me headforemost you
this<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.950> texture<00:03:11.280> pack<00:03:11.549> basic<00:03:12.510> faithful

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
this is the texture pack basic faithful

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.740 
this is the texture pack basic faithful
these<00:03:13.469> are<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:13.709> new<00:03:13.950> fish<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:15.389> new<00:03:15.540> wood

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
these are so new fish the new wood

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.439 
these are so new fish the new wood
planks<00:03:16.169> and<00:03:16.319> stuff<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.829> just<00:03:17.449> basic

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
planks and stuff like that just basic

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.360 
planks and stuff like that just basic
faithful<00:03:18.930> pretty<00:03:19.169> much<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.829> swords<00:03:20.190> are<00:03:20.340> a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
faithful pretty much the swords are a

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.610 
faithful pretty much the swords are a
bit<00:03:20.699> different<00:03:20.729> this<00:03:21.419> was<00:03:21.599> from<00:03:21.810> spiffy

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
bit different this was from spiffy

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.280 
bit different this was from spiffy
waffle<00:03:22.949> man's<00:03:23.129> tetra<00:03:23.489> pak<00:03:23.930> glass<00:03:24.930> panes

waffle man's tetra pak glass panes

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.119 
waffle man's tetra pak glass panes
that's<00:03:25.650> probably<00:03:25.919> just<00:03:26.099> normal<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:28.129> what's

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
that's probably just normal for what's

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.479 
that's probably just normal for what's
called<00:03:29.280> faithful<00:03:30.590> stuff<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.310> yeah

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
called faithful stuff like that so yeah

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.089 
called faithful stuff like that so yeah
these<00:03:32.669> are<00:03:32.729> most<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.239> textures<00:03:33.689> here<00:03:34.109> also

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
these are most of the textures here also

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.809 
these are most of the textures here also
if<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:36.060> into<00:03:36.359> fire<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:38.430> not<00:03:38.579> going<00:03:38.729> to

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
if you go into fire it's not going to

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.009 
if you go into fire it's not going to
take<00:03:38.970> up<00:03:39.000> your<00:03:39.120> whole<00:03:39.239> screen<00:03:39.659> so<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:39.900> you're

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
take up your whole screen so if you're

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.539 
take up your whole screen so if you're
pvping<00:03:40.439> and<00:03:40.590> stuff<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.370> has<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
pvping and stuff like that it has the

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.110 
pvping and stuff like that it has the
bow<00:03:42.389> when<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.199> charge<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.590> back<00:03:43.819> it<00:03:44.819> goes<00:03:44.970> from

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
bow when you charge it back it goes from

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.270 
bow when you charge it back it goes from
green<00:03:45.509> to<00:03:45.780> yellow<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.139> red<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.829> know<00:03:47.040> I

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
green to yellow to red so you know I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.059 
green to yellow to red so you know I
really<00:03:47.669> honestly<00:03:47.909> don't<00:03:48.509> look<00:03:48.689> at<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:49.069> it's

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
really honestly don't look at that it's

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.939 
really honestly don't look at that it's
cool<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:51.319> also<00:03:52.319> like<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.620> skinnier
