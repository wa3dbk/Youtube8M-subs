good it is once you know I've tested it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.140 
good it is once you know I've tested it
out<00:01:07.369> more<00:01:07.990> wow<00:01:08.990> that's<00:01:09.170> interesting<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:10.790> rolls

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
out more wow that's interesting it rolls

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.240 
out more wow that's interesting it rolls
out<00:01:11.390> like<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.780> that's<00:01:12.110> kind<00:01:12.799> of<00:01:12.830> neat<00:01:16.000> but

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
out like that that's kind of neat but

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.980 
out like that that's kind of neat but
let<00:01:19.250> us<00:01:20.200> peel<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:21.500> open<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.720> there<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.840> is

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
let us peel this open and there it is

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.520 
let us peel this open and there it is
there<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.220> motion<00:01:25.579> sensor<00:01:26.090> or<00:01:26.540> Kinect

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
there is the motion sensor or Kinect

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.730 
there is the motion sensor or Kinect
device<00:01:28.180> it's<00:01:29.180> actually<00:01:30.310> surprisingly<00:01:31.310> light

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
device it's actually surprisingly light

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.350 
device it's actually surprisingly light
it<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.890> surprisingly<00:01:34.460> light<00:01:34.790> there<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:37.360> want

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
it is surprisingly light there is want

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.569 
it is surprisingly light there is want
to<00:01:38.450> make<00:01:38.600> sure<00:01:38.810> I'm<00:01:39.110> not<00:01:39.290> gonna<00:01:39.470> just<00:01:39.710> break

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
to make sure I'm not gonna just break

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.260 
to make sure I'm not gonna just break
this<00:01:40.880> as<00:01:41.149> I<00:01:41.299> pull<00:01:41.329> this<00:01:41.689> out<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:42.380> case<00:01:43.270> to

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
this as I pull this out of this case to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.730 
this as I pull this out of this case to
lay<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.720> down<00:01:44.810> right<00:01:45.020> there<00:01:45.470> real<00:01:45.680> quick

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.660 

so<00:01:54.740> this<00:01:54.980> just<00:01:55.280> looks<00:01:55.550> like<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.670> actual

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
so this just looks like the actual

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.960 
so this just looks like the actual
adapter<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.300> plugs<00:01:59.360> into<00:01:59.990> your<00:02:02.110> Xbox<00:02:03.110> 360

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
adapter that plugs into your Xbox 360

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.660 
adapter that plugs into your Xbox 360
slim<00:02:04.970> or<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:06.970> let's<00:02:07.970> see<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:10.190> looks<00:02:10.430> like<00:02:10.520> it's

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
slim or and let's see it looks like it's

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.570 
slim or and let's see it looks like it's
got<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:12.430> power<00:02:13.430> adapter<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.740> sensor<00:02:16.310> as

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
got a power adapter for the sensor as

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.440 
got a power adapter for the sensor as
well<00:02:16.970> as<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.870> connector<00:02:18.790> proprietary<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:20.060> not

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
well as the connector proprietary or not

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.700 
well as the connector proprietary or not
proprietary<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.170> USB

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
proprietary so USB

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.840 
proprietary so USB
looks<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> connector<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.700> goes

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
looks like the connector that goes

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.760 
looks like the connector that goes
straight<00:02:23.210> into<00:02:23.480> your<00:02:24.460> Xbox<00:02:25.460> 360<00:02:26.270> oh<00:02:26.770> I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
straight into your Xbox 360 oh I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.500 
straight into your Xbox 360 oh I
understand<00:02:28.400> now<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.120> essentially

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
understand now so this is essentially

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.070 
understand now so this is essentially
the<00:02:30.380> cable<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.220> have<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.840> expo

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
the cable if you have the not the expo

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.200 
the cable if you have the not the expo
Xbox<00:02:33.680> 360<00:02:34.220> slim<00:02:34.520> but<00:02:34.820> if<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:34.970> have<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
Xbox 360 slim but if you have the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.420 
Xbox 360 slim but if you have the
original<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:36.230> can<00:02:36.380> use<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.860> convert<00:02:37.220> and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
original you can use this to convert and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.190 
original you can use this to convert and
power<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.970> or<00:02:39.880> use<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.480> proprietary

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
power it or use the proprietary

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.420 
power it or use the proprietary
connector<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.750> know<00:02:44.840> Microsoft<00:02:45.430> has
