00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.879
 [music] 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.360
 Hello everyone, sports shop with you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.480
 with Beeline and I whistling Arseny and today to 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.830
 we got the expected new 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 namely controversial nike kobe 9 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 the truth is that the first wave came in children 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 sizes gs or differently great cheekbones 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.980
 that is, on the little leg of knowledge 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.289
 dawn in my hands are confined to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 All Star Game 2014 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.109
 which is about to take place in new in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.309
 new orleans 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.140
 of course between adult children 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.870
 variants of sneakers are present 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.780
 some differences but as soon as 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.449
 us with the size I once again about everything 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.359
 I will tell for example impressions after 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.629
 fitting and materials used 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.640
 but of course in comparison immediately 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.460
 I will say that the main visible differences will be 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.400
 be in the materials of the example of this 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.860
 versions of the example in this version refused 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.180
 from fly not and use only 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.700
 engineers PNS 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 that is, this one from the mesh which you 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 now showing closer is already decent 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.780
 time this material is used by the company 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 nike 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.490
 well and it makes sneakers light and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.400
 durable as well as provide ventilation 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.530
 black film still visible 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 now I will show him closer 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.290
 printed in the front of the sneaker 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.080
 to protect our fingers from injury yet 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.570
 similar material is observed behind but 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.110
 here it is much denser than it is 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.930
 I think you can say everything for fixing 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.520
 that these elements are on both sides 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.870
 I will pull with the laces and fix our 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.940
 foot on top 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.280
 here we are still seeing such here cut out 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.540
 under the bones 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.260
 the back of this model is no less 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.930
 interesting 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.660
 Well, from myself add that in general, and I remember 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.570
 i am so flexible good sense 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.660
 sneaker now you'll see it all 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.840
 how soft and I drag you with my finger 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.030
 This cutout is probably well 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.570
 present here for comfort so we 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.910
 do not rub our feet still here 9 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.680
 red stripes 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.190
 a little bit higher which is unlikely in this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.770
 version is used to fix or 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.800
 something like that to me is just a hint 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.459
 on the fact that the cab mercs say damaged 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.800
 I 'll add my tendon 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.500
 tech flywire cost you 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.450
 see without her 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.709
 lace hole then only 7 each 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.500
 pieces on each side 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.720
 Now I show you this from the eyelet on 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.100
 language things themselves as you see painted 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.180
 put your sneaker inside 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.430
 Now here you see many styles 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.130
 second set of marmots but he's already with 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.920
 such specks droplets match 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.070
 the sole now take the laced 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.600
 sneakers on it you can clearly see that the tongue 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.730
 not an inner boot and what is it 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.950
 oddly it helps with ventilation 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.910
 think you see this hole here 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.540
 which is covered with a mesh on top 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.090
 top of uvula 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.170
 padding material present 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.950
 actually as inside this 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.920
 models all this as always for comfort 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.920
 now show you the insole if in normal 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.800
 version it will be made from lunarlon a 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.200
 then here I am personally tormented by doubts 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.140
 what is material and in any case 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.660
 she is from the foam that answers 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.800
 Of course, for the mortgage put 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.630
 The trend of the sneaker is of course kept 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.040
 they still undoubtedly have 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.430
 great feeling card 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.130
 since they have a very thin sole 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.800
 actually like the whole series of kobi and all 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.020
 just sneakers are required enough 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.500
 fix leg well and is achieved 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.600
 it is no doubt the height of that model already 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.130
 I think long ago they realized that they are very high 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.380
 Well, I also think that you have not done it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.350
 play similar ones here and 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.840
 this fixing is achieved due to such 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.700
 here are the overlaps that are present as 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.810
 you see them from God from all sides 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.600
 now with your finger all this and even 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.900
 the sole because its green is responsible for 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.900
 fixation 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.500
 mice will be seen such here 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.530
 plates which also fix the whole 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.510
 the result is well and the sole as stated in 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.060
 manufacturing companies lit up in 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.130
 darkness it's own to be observed and 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.390
 the entire collection dedicated to the match of all 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.210
 stars I of course 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.960
 it will start the night light and he checked well 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.510
 and agree 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.290
 even adding it was that the soles are very bright 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.450
 glows done she in my from 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.650
 soft rubber 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.280
 drawing as you see imitates 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.160
 footprint well what to some extent 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.930
 may hint at ease and 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.190
 naturalness in movements when these 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.510
 sneakers shod 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:27.100
 us on the foot of the logos by the way is not so 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:31.130
 a lot can be because it 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.310
 graph version of sneakers but one of them 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:40.340
 and there icon saves on the sole now you 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.110
 see from the back still on the tongue yet 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.080
 are present see from above 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.230
 there is still painting kobi still seeing 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.720
 golden swoosh on both sides outwardly from 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.810
 internal well still seen so 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.530
 called cobie code which is well for me personally 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.360
 difficult transmitted transferable yet 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.590
 once I remind you that before you was 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.100
 only great cheekbones 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.630
 version divide them into peace for cob 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.860
 which replaced of course the series 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.120
 material well, apparently Technology 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.180
 Well, there is actually nothing new. 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.770
 always happened and as soon as I promise 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.840
 to you as soon as we get an adult 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.970
 already wait for the full review 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.430
 of course with the history of the creatures 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.960
 creation and other facts than 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.960
