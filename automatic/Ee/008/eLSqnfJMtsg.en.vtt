originally<00:00:21.060> came<00:00:21.270> out<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.810> thought<00:00:21.960> they

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
originally came out with I thought they

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
originally came out with I thought they
were<00:00:22.170> gonna<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> same<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.369> they're

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
were gonna be the same thing but they're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
were gonna be the same thing but they're
actually<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.359> lot<00:00:24.720> different<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.350> opinion

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
actually a lot different in my opinion

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.189 
actually a lot different in my opinion
anyway<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:27.269> tried<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
anyway I have tried this this is the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.140 
anyway I have tried this this is the
only<00:00:28.230> shade<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.070> these<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
only shade of these I have because I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420 
only shade of these I have because I
returned<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.779> other<00:00:30.960> ones<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.470> really

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
returned all my other ones I really

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.889 
returned all my other ones I really
don't<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> formula<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.719> on

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
don't like the formula that much on

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.450 
don't like the formula that much on
these<00:00:34.079> they're<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.350> very<00:00:34.680> moisturizing<00:00:35.370> at

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and I feel like these pop bombs are a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.490 
and I feel like these pop bombs are a
lot<00:00:38.430> more<00:00:38.460> moisturizing<00:00:39.390> than<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> original

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
lot more moisturizing than the original

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.590 
lot more moisturizing than the original

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
going to the beach you don't want

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.380 
lipstick you don't want gloss this is
something<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.160> would<00:03:05.340> definitely<00:03:05.850> wear<00:03:06.030> for

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
something I would definitely wear for

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.180 
something I would definitely wear for
any<00:03:06.600> occasion<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.650> next<00:03:07.950> one<00:03:08.160> is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
any occasion like that this next one is

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.280 
any occasion like that this next one is
called<00:03:08.550> wild<00:03:08.790> Lily<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.390> here's<00:03:09.630> one<00:03:09.900> layer<00:03:10.110> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
called wild Lily and here's one layer of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.780 
called wild Lily and here's one layer of
it<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.500> my<00:03:10.590> lips<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.010> doesn't<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.400> get<00:03:11.610> more

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
it on my lips it doesn't really get more

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.120 
it on my lips it doesn't really get more
pigmented<00:03:12.300> than<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.740> kind<00:03:14.010> of

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
pigmented than this you can kind of

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.370 
pigmented than this you can kind of
layer<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.460> but<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:15.180> don't<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:15.990> think<00:03:16.050> it

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
layer it but I don't really think it

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.230 
layer it but I don't really think it
gets<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.890> much<00:03:17.250> stronger<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.760> pigmentation

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
gets that much stronger of pigmentation

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.030 
gets that much stronger of pigmentation
so<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> would<00:03:19.080> just<00:03:19.110> leave<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.530> after<00:03:19.680> one<00:03:20.010> or

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
so I would just leave it after one or

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.430 
so I would just leave it after one or
two<00:03:20.190> swipes<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.270> yeah<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.170> as

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
two swipes so yeah it's not really as

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.990 
two swipes so yeah it's not really as
bright<00:03:22.740> as<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.010> shows<00:03:23.190> up<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.550> tube<00:03:23.730> like

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
bright as it shows up in the tube like

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.280 
bright as it shows up in the tube like
you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.330> see<00:03:24.480> right<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.960> looks<00:03:24.990> like

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
you can see right there it looks like

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.270 
you can see right there it looks like
it's<00:03:25.410> gonna<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.650> crazy

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
it's gonna be crazy

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.130 
it's gonna be crazy

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.210 
definitely are
last<00:04:23.479> but<00:04:23.690> not<00:04:23.780> least<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.110> have<00:04:24.139> fiery<00:04:24.620> red<00:04:25.009> this

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
last but not least I have fiery red this

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.680 
last but not least I have fiery red this
one<00:04:25.400> it's<00:04:25.580> also<00:04:25.729> a<00:04:25.880> favorite<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.330> mine<00:04:26.509> just

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
one it's also a favorite of mine just

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.990 
one it's also a favorite of mine just
because<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.470> red<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.490> does<00:04:28.669> kind<00:04:28.910> of

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
because it is a red and it does kind of

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.820 
because it is a red and it does kind of
come<00:04:29.210> off<00:04:29.240> as<00:04:29.539> a<00:04:29.569> bright<00:04:29.930> cherry<00:04:30.259> red<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.770> think

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
come off as a bright cherry red I think

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.140 
come off as a bright cherry red I think
this<00:04:31.100> will<00:04:31.250> look<00:04:31.400> different<00:04:31.759> depending<00:04:31.849> on

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
this will look different depending on

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.689 
this will look different depending on
what<00:04:32.330> skin<00:04:32.599> tone<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:33.949> me<00:04:34.130> these<00:04:34.460> all

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
what skin tone you have to me these all

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.610 
what skin tone you have to me these all
come<00:04:34.940> off<00:04:34.970> as<00:04:35.270> vibrant<00:04:35.780> but<00:04:35.900> soft<00:04:36.289> at<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.560> same

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
come off as vibrant but soft at the same

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.950 
come off as vibrant but soft at the same
time<00:04:37.069> and<00:04:37.400> that's<00:04:37.940> another<00:04:38.270> reason<00:04:38.810> why<00:04:38.930> I

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
time and that's another reason why I

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.719 
time and that's another reason why I
really<00:04:39.080> like<00:04:39.440> these<00:04:39.620> just<00:04:39.830> because<00:04:40.220> they're

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
really like these just because they're

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.159 
really like these just because they're
wearable<00:04:41.240> but<00:04:41.389> they're<00:04:41.539> noticeable<00:04:42.020> they're

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
wearable but they're noticeable they're

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.629 
wearable but they're noticeable they're
not<00:04:42.349> like<00:04:42.530> those<00:04:42.770> tinted<00:04:43.190> lip<00:04:43.340> balms<00:04:43.520> that

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
not like those tinted lip balms that

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.070 
not like those tinted lip balms that
look<00:04:43.849> like<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.090> don't<00:04:44.210> have<00:04:44.449> anything<00:04:44.660> on

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
look like you don't have anything on

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.409 
look like you don't have anything on
so<00:04:45.349> that's<00:04:45.530> fiery<00:04:45.889> red<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.060> will<00:04:47.210> do<00:04:47.389> a
