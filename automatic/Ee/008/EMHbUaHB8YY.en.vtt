you<00:04:20.280> know<00:04:20.400> one<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.669> day<00:04:21.000> at<00:04:21.299> most<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:22.380> mean<00:04:22.410> that's

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
you know one a day at most I mean that's

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.469 
you know one a day at most I mean that's
still<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.070> pretty<00:04:23.220> good<00:04:23.580> amount<00:04:23.790> should<00:04:24.330> have

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
still a pretty good amount should have

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.330 
still a pretty good amount should have
it<00:04:24.570> like<00:04:24.690> once<00:04:24.930> every<00:04:25.260> couple<00:04:25.380> days<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.950> it's

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
it like once every couple days and it's

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.530 
it like once every couple days and it's
not<00:04:26.490> gonna<00:04:26.610> be<00:04:26.700> bad<00:04:26.850> for<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.060> at<00:04:27.150> all

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
not gonna be bad for you at all

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.240 
not gonna be bad for you at all
there's<00:04:27.690> no<00:04:27.930> like<00:04:28.230> side<00:04:28.530> effects<00:04:28.830> or<00:04:28.980> anything

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
there's no like side effects or anything

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.980 
there's no like side effects or anything
if<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.460> have<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.670> in<00:04:29.760> moderation<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.480> that's

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
if you have it in moderation and that's

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.990

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
why everything in my opinion is great

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000 
why everything in my opinion is great
moderation<00:04:33.420> other<00:04:33.900> than<00:04:34.080> heroin<00:04:34.320> that's<00:04:34.860> it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
moderation other than heroin that's it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.380 
moderation other than heroin that's it
