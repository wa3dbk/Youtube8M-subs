00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
test using your castle link now I'm not

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.860 
test using your castle link now I'm not
sure<00:00:09.360> if<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.599> see<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.900> too<00:00:10.230> well<00:00:10.469> but<00:00:10.800> uh

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
alright let's start with the first step

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.740 
alright let's start with the first step
most<00:00:14.820> important<00:00:15.299> step

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
most important step

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.250 
most important step
removing<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:16.590> pinion<00:00:17.220> gear<00:00:18.260> definitely

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
removing your pinion gear definitely

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.769 
removing your pinion gear definitely
remove<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.490> pinion<00:00:20.850> gear<00:00:21.029> first<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
remove your pinion gear first and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.290 
remove your pinion gear first and
foremost<00:00:22.350> your<00:00:23.039> motor<00:00:23.460> has<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.730> be<00:00:23.939> able<00:00:24.029> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
foremost your motor has to be able to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
foremost your motor has to be able to
run<00:00:24.510> freely<00:00:24.869> without<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.529> wheels<00:00:25.740> spinning

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
run freely without the wheels spinning

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.820 
run freely without the wheels spinning
or<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.480> slide<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.720> motor<00:00:28.019> over<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.529> me

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
or you can slide your motor over for me

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.430 
or you can slide your motor over for me
it<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.160> easier<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.849> remove<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> gear<00:00:30.650> no

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
it was easier just to remove the gear no

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.810 
it was easier just to remove the gear no
obviously<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.920> point<00:00:35.250> I've<00:00:35.370> already<00:00:35.489> got

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
obviously at this point I've already got

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.249 

and<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:53.040> stops<00:01:53.820> automatically<00:01:54.479> once<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> stops

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and it stops automatically once it stops

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.530 
and it stops automatically once it stops
you<00:01:55.560> let<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.829> your<00:01:56.040> full<00:01:56.159> throttle<00:01:56.700> shut<00:01:57.420> off

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
you let off your full throttle shut off

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.270 
you let off your full throttle shut off
your<00:01:57.719> car<00:01:58.159> shut<00:01:59.159> off<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.490> radio<00:02:01.070> then<00:02:02.070> we

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
will unplug from our receiver and back

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.570 
will unplug from our receiver and back
in<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.860> our<00:02:07.890> castle<00:02:08.310> week

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.160 

now<00:02:15.769> it's<00:02:16.769> coming<00:02:17.010> back<00:02:17.129> up<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.750> main<00:02:18.930> page

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
now it's coming back up to the main page

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.410 
now it's coming back up to the main page
so<00:02:19.709> we<00:02:19.920> will<00:02:20.069> go<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.280> power<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.030> see<00:02:24.299> it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
so we will go to power and as you see it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.339 
so we will go to power and as you see it
says<00:02:24.590> motor<00:02:25.590> test<00:02:25.950> data<00:02:26.340> has<00:02:26.700> been<00:02:27.000> acquired

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
says motor test data has been acquired

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.190 
says motor test data has been acquired
now<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.409> are<00:02:28.829> able<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.400> adjust<00:02:30.150> our<00:02:30.629> torque

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
now we are able to adjust our torque

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.729 
now we are able to adjust our torque
limit<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:33.390> was<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.840> quick<00:02:34.019> how-to
