get<00:02:21.080> my<00:02:21.260> guess<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.950> system<00:02:22.340> will<00:02:22.490> be

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
get my guess is that the system will be

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.930 
get my guess is that the system will be
able<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:22.910> play<00:02:23.030> wii<00:02:23.780> games<00:02:24.490> but<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.520> mean<00:02:25.700> you

more<00:02:30.680> expensive<00:02:30.709> nintendo<00:02:31.459> system<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.940> think

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
more expensive nintendo system I think

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.360 
more expensive nintendo system I think
it's<00:02:32.930> gonna<00:02:33.020> have<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.230> go<00:02:33.380> beyond<00:02:33.680> waggled<00:02:34.220> of

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
it's gonna have to go beyond waggled of

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.040 
it's gonna have to go beyond waggled of
is<00:02:34.640> look<00:02:34.820> at<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:34.970> connect<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.660> mean<00:02:35.870> that's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
is look at the connect I mean that's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.140 
is look at the connect I mean that's
people<00:02:36.680> are<00:02:37.190> starting<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.610> compare<00:02:38.000> to

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
people are starting to compare to

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.060 
people are starting to compare to
connect<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.660> wii<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.680> wii<00:02:39.800> doesn't

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070

have<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.280> they're<00:02:40.670> converting<00:02:41.209> we<00:02:41.420> owners<00:02:41.810> to

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
have it they're converting we owners to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.990 
have it they're converting we owners to
the<00:02:42.140> kinect<00:02:42.500> at<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.980> very<00:02:43.250> rapid<00:02:43.459> rate<00:02:43.670> so

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
the kinect at a very rapid rate so

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.860 
the kinect at a very rapid rate so
they're<00:02:44.150> definitely<00:02:44.270> gonna<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.720> move

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
they're definitely gonna have to move

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.320 
they're definitely gonna have to move
beyond<00:02:45.140> waggle<00:02:46.100> i'm<00:02:46.310> thinking<00:02:47.000> i<00:02:47.120> don't<00:02:47.150> know
