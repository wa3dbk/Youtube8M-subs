00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
information about the game he was very

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.730 
information about the game he was very
careful<00:01:05.070> though<00:01:05.810> he's<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:06.869> careful<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
careful though he's very careful to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.130 
careful though he's very careful to
select<00:01:07.890> his<00:01:08.220> words<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:09.330> wasn't<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:09.780> clear

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
select his words it wasn't very clear

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.609 
select his words it wasn't very clear
initially<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> tell<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
initially but we can tell now that the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.130 
initially but we can tell now that the
game<00:01:14.240> mechanics<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.420> weather<00:01:15.630> won't<00:01:15.930> be

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
game mechanics for weather won't be

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
game mechanics for weather won't be
dynamic<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.820> example<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
dynamic like they are for example and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.010 
dynamic like they are for example and
project<00:01:18.570> cars<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.250> four<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> six<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.869> will

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
project cars so in four to six you will

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.340 
project cars so in four to six you will
just<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.290> either<00:01:22.890> dry<00:01:23.820> weather<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.229> will

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
just have either dry weather or you will

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
just have either dry weather or you will
have<00:01:25.380> wet<00:01:25.770> weather<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.280> there<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.270> only<00:01:27.360> be

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
have wet weather and there are only be

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.569 
have wet weather and there are only be
honest<00:01:27.750> electric<00:01:28.170> circuits<00:01:28.770> from<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.430> we

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
honest electric circuits from what we

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
honest electric circuits from what we
can<00:01:29.700> tell<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> moment<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
can tell at the moment the one of the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.030 
can tell at the moment the one of the
main<00:01:32.280> reasons<00:01:32.670> why<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.750> weather<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.500> not

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
main reasons why the weather is not

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.830 
main reasons why the weather is not
dynamic<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> time<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> day<00:01:36.540> isn't

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
dynamic all the time of day isn't

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.710 
dynamic all the time of day isn't
dynamic<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.490> preserve<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.329> 1080p<00:01:39.979> 60fps

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
dynamic is to preserve the 1080p 60fps

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.940 
dynamic is to preserve the 1080p 60fps
mantra<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.310> turn<00:01:44.310> 10<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.939> maintain<00:01:45.950> so

weather all the time it would drain

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
circuits will provide wet weather and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.720 
circuits will provide wet weather and
nighttime<00:02:22.300> at<00:02:23.230> least<00:02:23.410> that's<00:02:23.650> what<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.280> can

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
nighttime at least that's what I can

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.940 
nighttime at least that's what I can
gather<00:02:24.910> leaves<00:02:25.510> us<00:02:25.750> what<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.019> can<00:02:26.290> tell<00:02:26.590> from

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
gather leaves us what I can tell from

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.559 
gather leaves us what I can tell from
the<00:02:27.250> interviews<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.030> videos<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.480> I've

the interviews and the videos that I've

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.330 
the interviews and the videos that I've
seen<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.220> tracks<00:02:30.880> are<00:02:31.060> i<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.330> seen<00:02:31.690> in

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
seen so the tracks are i have seen in

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.539

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
i've seen that in the rain seen Sebring

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.330 
i've seen that in the rain seen Sebring
a<00:02:39.280> train<00:02:39.670> with<00:02:40.420> rain<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.870> at<00:02:41.350> night<00:02:41.560> although

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
a train with rain and at night although

a train with rain and at night although
not<00:02:42.549> at<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.700> same<00:02:42.880> time<00:02:43.380> that's<00:02:44.380> quite

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
not at the same time that's quite

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.490 
not at the same time that's quite
important<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.420> point<00:02:46.600> out<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:46.930> i<00:02:47.230> don't

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
important to point out that i don't

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.559 
important to point out that i don't
think<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:48.040> do<00:02:48.220> rain<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.970> night<00:02:49.330> at<00:02:49.480> the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
think you can do rain and night at the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.680 
think you can do rain and night at the
same<00:02:49.780> time<00:02:50.489> also<00:02:51.489> i've<00:02:51.700> seen<00:02:51.910> LaVon<00:02:52.090> at<00:02:52.450> night

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690

Nurburgring<00:03:00.549> I've<00:03:00.640> seen<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.120> rain<00:03:01.359> and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
Nurburgring I've seen in the rain and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.890 
Nurburgring I've seen in the rain and
I've<00:03:01.930> seen<00:03:02.109> Silverstone<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.010> rain<00:03:03.190> so

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
I've seen Silverstone in the rain so

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.660 
I've seen Silverstone in the rain so
those<00:03:04.900> are<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.140> tracks<00:03:05.470> which<00:03:05.799> I've<00:03:05.980> seen<00:03:06.340> so

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
those are the tracks which I've seen so

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.449 
those are the tracks which I've seen so
far<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:07.329> those<00:03:07.660> configurations<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:09.070> course

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
far in those configurations of course

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.190 
far in those configurations of course
we'll<00:03:09.700> have<00:03:09.880> all<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.180> circuits<00:03:10.780> during<00:03:11.109> the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
we'll have all the circuits during the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.370 
we'll have all the circuits during the
day<00:03:11.380> as<00:03:11.590> well<00:03:11.769> as<00:03:12.070> standard<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:14.019> then<00:03:14.140> some<00:03:14.350> of

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
day as well as standard but then some of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.319 
day as well as standard but then some of
these<00:03:14.500> circuits<00:03:14.980> will<00:03:15.190> feature<00:03:15.400> rain

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
these circuits will feature rain

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.020 
these circuits will feature rain
gameplay<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.560> some<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.400> each<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.790> nights

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
gameplay and some of each and nights

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.020 
gameplay and some of each and nights
maybe<00:03:19.870> rain<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.859> night<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.670> reason<00:03:21.820> they

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
maybe rain and night so the reason they

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.259 
maybe rain and night so the reason they
provide<00:03:22.540> for<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:24.070> it's<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:25.000> bit<00:03:25.150> more

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
provide for this is that it's a bit more

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.789 
provide for this is that it's a bit more
realistic<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.519> pulley<00:03:27.760> wooden<00:03:28.799> you

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
realistic that you you pulley wooden you

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.650 
realistic that you you pulley wooden you
pulley<00:03:30.010> wouldn't<00:03:30.430> turn<00:03:30.609> up<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.239> don't<00:03:31.570> know

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
pulley wouldn't turn up to I don't know

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.270 
pulley wouldn't turn up to I don't know
let's<00:03:31.959> say<00:03:32.019> Brands<00:03:32.470> Hatch<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.920> night<00:03:33.130> they

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
let's say Brands Hatch that night they

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280 
let's say Brands Hatch that night they
don't<00:03:33.489> do<00:03:33.700> night<00:03:34.000> racing<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.930> there<00:03:35.049> isn't

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
don't do night racing so there isn't

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.400 
don't do night racing so there isn't
much<00:03:35.410> need<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.209> argue<00:03:37.420> there<00:03:38.019> isn't<00:03:38.230> much

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
much need you can argue there isn't much

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.720 
much need you can argue there isn't much
need<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.980> do<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:40.720> create<00:03:41.130> night<00:03:42.130> racing<00:03:42.519> in<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
need to do to create night racing in the

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.309 
need to do to create night racing in the
game<00:03:42.940> well<00:03:43.480> though<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.690> would<00:03:43.780> be<00:03:43.900> nice<00:03:44.079> I

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
game well though it would be nice I

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.650 
game well though it would be nice I
suppose<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.890> be<00:03:45.280> able<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.489> do<00:03:45.609> any<00:03:45.790> circuit<00:03:46.359> in

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
suppose to be able to do any circuit in

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.920 
suppose to be able to do any circuit in
the<00:03:47.170> rain<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.829> at<00:03:48.010> night<00:03:48.220> or<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:49.720> or<00:03:49.840> the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the rain and at night or one or the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.349 
the rain and at night or one or the
other<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:51.250> when<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.459> comes<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.880> rainfall

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
other so when it comes to the rainfall

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.420 
other so when it comes to the rainfall
you<00:03:53.139> won't<00:03:53.319> just<00:03:53.500> be<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.859> track<00:03:54.040> won't<00:03:54.250> just

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
you won't just be the track won't just

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.270 
you won't just be the track won't just
be<00:03:54.519> wet<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.970> will<00:03:55.150> actually<00:03:55.359> be<00:03:55.750> raining<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:57.160> in

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
be wet it will actually be raining so in

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.129 
be wet it will actually be raining so in
that<00:03:57.400> sense<00:03:57.670> it's<00:03:58.090> quite<00:03:58.510> unusual<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:59.019> it

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
that sense it's quite unusual that it

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.750 
that sense it's quite unusual that it
isn't<00:03:59.350> dynamic<00:03:59.739> because<00:04:00.040> if<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.430> raining

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
isn't dynamic because if it is raining

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.490 
isn't dynamic because if it is raining
and<00:04:01.239> surely<00:04:01.720> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
and surely the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.350 
and surely the
the<00:04:02.830> track<00:04:03.130> should<00:04:03.520> change<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.030> puddle

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
the track should change the puddle

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.900 
the track should change the puddle
should<00:04:04.540> get<00:04:04.660> bigger<00:04:04.930> if<00:04:05.260> it's<00:04:05.710> raining<00:04:05.910> but

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
should get bigger if it's raining but

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.460 
should get bigger if it's raining but
that's<00:04:07.510> not<00:04:07.690> that's<00:04:07.900> not<00:04:08.020> going<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.290> be<00:04:08.320> the

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
that's not that's not going to be the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.340 
that's not that's not going to be the
case<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:09.060> suppose<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.450> if<00:04:10.780> you're<00:04:11.200> only

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
case I suppose is that if you're only

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.870 
case I suppose is that if you're only
going<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.620> be<00:04:11.710> racing<00:04:12.040> for<00:04:12.070> five<00:04:12.220> minutes<00:04:12.610> then

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
going to be racing for five minutes then

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.830 
going to be racing for five minutes then
they<00:04:12.910> probably<00:04:13.150> won't<00:04:13.300> change<00:04:13.570> too<00:04:13.810> much

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
they probably won't change too much

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.569 
they probably won't change too much
anyway<00:04:14.460> but<00:04:16.470> they've<00:04:17.470> been<00:04:17.859> modeling<00:04:18.310> the

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
anyway but they've been modeling the

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.030 
anyway but they've been modeling the
hydroplaning<00:04:19.329> quite<00:04:19.989> carefully<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.920> they've

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
hydroplaning quite carefully and they've

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.280 
hydroplaning quite carefully and they've
modeled<00:04:21.459> all<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.910> puddles<00:04:22.330> very<00:04:22.900> carefully

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
modeled all the puddles very carefully

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.840 
modeled all the puddles very carefully
so<00:04:23.350> obviously<00:04:23.860> done<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.130> lot<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.370> research<00:04:24.820> into

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
so obviously done a lot of research into

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.820 
so obviously done a lot of research into
exactly<00:04:25.480> where<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.990> rain<00:04:26.170> falls<00:04:26.500> on<00:04:26.650> its

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
exactly where the rain falls on its

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.360 
exactly where the rain falls on its
circuit<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.430> they<00:04:28.390> know<00:04:28.980> when<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.100> when<00:04:30.340> it

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
circuit and they know when it when it

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.070 
circuit and they know when it when it
falls<00:04:30.670> they<00:04:31.060> know<00:04:31.240> where<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.600> puddles<00:04:31.960> will

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
falls they know where the puddles will

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.650 
falls they know where the puddles will
be<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:32.950> try<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.190> recreate<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.270> the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
be and I try to recreate that in the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.100 
be and I try to recreate that in the
game<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.890> obviously<00:04:36.340> have<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.120> win<00:04:37.930> you'll

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
game so you obviously have to win you'll

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.600 
game so you obviously have to win you'll
be<00:04:38.169> playing<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.530> game<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.740> have<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.010> try<00:04:39.550> and

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
be playing the game you have to try and

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.090 
be playing the game you have to try and
choose<00:04:40.030> very<00:04:40.540> carefully<00:04:40.980> it's<00:04:41.980> actually

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
choose very carefully it's actually

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.130 
choose very carefully it's actually
exactly<00:04:42.550> which<00:04:43.210> line<00:04:43.540> you're<00:04:43.720> going<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.900> take

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
exactly which line you're going to take

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.909 
exactly which line you're going to take
because<00:04:45.040> taking<00:04:45.810> taking<00:04:46.810> lines<00:04:47.200> in<00:04:47.560> wet

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
because taking taking lines in wet

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.070 
because taking taking lines in wet
weather<00:04:47.950> is<00:04:48.370> isn't<00:04:48.850> very<00:04:49.060> sim<00:04:49.450> is<00:04:49.660> not<00:04:49.900> very

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
weather is isn't very sim is not very

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.330 
weather is isn't very sim is not very
simple<00:04:50.940> art<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:52.600> let's<00:04:52.990> put<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.260> that<00:04:53.290> way<00:04:53.410> so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
simple art is let's put it that way so

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.220 
simple art is let's put it that way so
you<00:04:54.430> can<00:04:54.550> have<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.700> be<00:04:54.790> very<00:04:54.910> careful<00:04:55.360> where

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
you can have to be very careful where

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.409 
you can have to be very careful where
exactly<00:04:56.440> we<00:04:56.860> drive<00:04:57.160> because<00:04:57.580> sometimes<00:04:58.360> you

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
exactly we drive because sometimes you

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.570 
exactly we drive because sometimes you
can't<00:04:58.660> see<00:04:58.870> what<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.440> grip<00:04:59.620> is<00:04:59.800> sometimes

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
can't see what the grip is sometimes

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.270 
can't see what the grip is sometimes
there's<00:05:01.540> invisible<00:05:02.140> rivers<00:05:02.500> forming<00:05:03.010> across

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
there's invisible rivers forming across

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.100 
there's invisible rivers forming across
the<00:05:03.430> track<00:05:03.669> you<00:05:04.240> can't<00:05:04.419> always<00:05:04.570> see<00:05:04.840> where<00:05:05.050> the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
the track you can't always see where the

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.920 
the track you can't always see where the
grip<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.380> so<00:05:05.530> be<00:05:05.680> interesting<00:05:06.100> to<00:05:06.250> drive<00:05:06.930> and

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
grip is so be interesting to drive and

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.040 
grip is so be interesting to drive and
see<00:05:08.290> what<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.680> grip<00:05:09.040> will<00:05:09.280> be<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:09.780> as<00:05:10.780> for

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
see what the grip will be like as for

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.040 
see what the grip will be like as for
nighttime<00:05:12.660> that<00:05:13.660> would<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.870> very

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
nighttime that would be a very

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.150 
nighttime that would be a very
interesting<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.590> play<00:05:14.740> I'm<00:05:15.550> not<00:05:15.729> sure<00:05:15.790> exactly

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
interesting to play I'm not sure exactly

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.040 
interesting to play I'm not sure exactly
how<00:05:18.160> it's<00:05:18.340> going<00:05:18.520> to<00:05:18.550> pan<00:05:18.760> out<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.300> can't

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
how it's going to pan out I can't

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.670 
how it's going to pan out I can't
imagine<00:05:20.169> myself<00:05:20.590> playing<00:05:21.100> it<00:05:21.310> too<00:05:21.520> much<00:05:21.790> I<00:05:22.680> i

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
imagine myself playing it too much I i

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.310 
imagine myself playing it too much I i
I've<00:05:24.490> a<00:05:24.520> feeling<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.410> this<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:28.840> expand

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
I've a feeling that this this expand

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.810 
I've a feeling that this this expand
that's<00:05:29.710> called<00:05:29.919> an<00:05:30.040> expansion<00:05:30.580> this

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
that's called an expansion this

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.530 
that's called an expansion this
expansion<00:05:31.450> of<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.810> series<00:05:33.000> is<00:05:34.000> really<00:05:34.390> just

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
expansion of the series is really just

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.870 
expansion of the series is really just
to<00:05:34.600> keep<00:05:34.810> pace<00:05:35.229> with<00:05:35.590> competitors<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:36.729> you've

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
to keep pace with competitors so you've

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.840 
to keep pace with competitors so you've
had<00:05:37.030> other<00:05:37.270> series<00:05:37.870> which<00:05:38.140> can<00:05:38.350> boast<00:05:38.850> by

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
had other series which can boast by

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.520 
had other series which can boast by
project<00:05:40.240> cars<00:05:40.390> I<00:05:40.600> know<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:41.050> lot<00:05:41.380> of<00:05:41.440> people

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
project cars I know a lot of people

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.030 
project cars I know a lot of people
don't<00:05:41.860> like<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.190> game<00:05:42.400> but<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:43.120> can<00:05:43.360> do<00:05:44.040> they

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
don't like the game but it can do they

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.960 
don't like the game but it can do they
can<00:05:45.280> do<00:05:45.550> dynamic<00:05:46.419> weather<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.760> dynamic<00:05:48.760> time

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
can do dynamic weather and dynamic time

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.020 
can do dynamic weather and dynamic time
of<00:05:49.150> day<00:05:49.330> so<00:05:50.250> wars<00:05:51.250> are<00:05:51.370> probably<00:05:51.640> has<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.880> keep

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
of day so wars are probably has to keep

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.080 
of day so wars are probably has to keep
up<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.630> an<00:05:52.720> extent<00:05:53.140> just<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.470> show<00:05:53.620> they<00:05:53.830> can

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
up to an extent just to show they can

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.760 
up to an extent just to show they can
keep<00:05:55.090> pace<00:05:55.360> with<00:05:55.390> its<00:05:55.750> competitors<00:05:56.380> in<00:05:56.560> the

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
keep pace with its competitors in the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.460 
keep pace with its competitors in the
gaming<00:05:56.979> market<00:05:57.630> which

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
gaming market which

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.950 
gaming market which
we've<00:06:00.220> probably<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.670> right<00:06:00.790> thing<00:06:00.850> to<00:06:01.180> do<00:06:01.360> but

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
we've probably the right thing to do but

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.750 
we've probably the right thing to do but
to<00:06:02.170> be<00:06:02.320> honest<00:06:02.590> I<00:06:02.740> probably<00:06:03.070> won't<00:06:03.340> be<00:06:03.520> playing

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
to be honest I probably won't be playing

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.710 
to be honest I probably won't be playing
in<00:06:04.150> night<00:06:04.780> for<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.350> rain<00:06:05.890> to<00:06:06.040> much<00:06:06.420> to<00:06:07.420> me<00:06:07.450> is

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
in night for the rain to much to me is

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.090 
in night for the rain to much to me is
probably<00:06:07.960> just<00:06:08.200> a<00:06:08.320> little<00:06:08.410> bit<00:06:08.620> of<00:06:08.680> a<00:06:08.740> gimmick

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
probably just a little bit of a gimmick

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.480 
probably just a little bit of a gimmick
and<00:06:09.390> I<00:06:10.390> probably<00:06:10.600> won't<00:06:10.870> really<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:12.160> plate

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
and I probably won't really a plate

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.700 
and I probably won't really a plate
straight<00:06:13.060> away<00:06:13.150> just<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.170> see<00:06:14.320> what<00:06:14.470> it's<00:06:14.560> like

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
straight away just to see what it's like

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.170 
straight away just to see what it's like
but<00:06:14.980> then<00:06:15.100> after<00:06:15.400> that<00:06:15.490> bully<00:06:15.760> won't<00:06:15.970> play<00:06:16.120> too

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
but then after that bully won't play too

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.870 
but then after that bully won't play too
much<00:06:16.630> I<00:06:16.960> just<00:06:17.710> rather<00:06:17.890> stick<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.490> the<00:06:18.670> dry

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
much I just rather stick to the dry

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.050 
much I just rather stick to the dry
weather<00:06:19.090> racing<00:06:19.690> where<00:06:20.620> you<00:06:20.980> have<00:06:21.310> a<00:06:21.580> decent

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
weather racing where you have a decent

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.280 
weather racing where you have a decent
amount<00:06:22.240> of<00:06:22.420> grip<00:06:22.570> and<00:06:22.750> you<00:06:22.810> can<00:06:22.960> see<00:06:23.110> where

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
amount of grip and you can see where

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.500 
amount of grip and you can see where
you're<00:06:23.320> going<00:06:23.610> but<00:06:24.610> that's<00:06:24.850> just<00:06:24.970> my<00:06:25.210> thoughts

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
you're going but that's just my thoughts

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
on the game of course you might have

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.070 
on the game of course you might have
different<00:06:27.220> opinion<00:06:27.790> on<00:06:27.910> that<00:06:28.060> which<00:06:28.930> of

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
weather the fact that it's not going to

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.890 
weather the fact that it's not going to
be<00:06:38.170> on<00:06:38.350> all<00:06:38.590> circuits<00:06:39.220> and<00:06:39.750> just<00:06:40.750> your

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
thoughts on it in general so we're going

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.880

to<00:06:43.330> go<00:06:43.420> over<00:06:43.450> the<00:06:43.780> line<00:06:43.930> here<00:06:44.230> and<00:06:44.410> finish<00:06:44.680> the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
to go over the line here and finish the

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.420 
to go over the line here and finish the
race<00:06:45.070> it<00:06:46.060> was<00:06:46.210> a<00:06:46.240> quite<00:06:46.510> closely<00:06:46.810> for<00:06:47.140> race

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
race it was a quite closely for race

that<00:06:48.430> Ferrari<00:06:48.820> Enzo<00:06:49.060> is<00:06:49.300> free<00:06:49.570> down<00:06:49.750> quickly

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
that Ferrari Enzo is free down quickly

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.870 
that Ferrari Enzo is free down quickly
as<00:06:50.320> an<00:06:50.410> s-class<00:06:50.740> so<00:06:51.190> it's<00:06:51.310> a<00:06:51.370> bit<00:06:51.490> quicker<00:06:51.730> than

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
as an s-class so it's a bit quicker than

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.940 
as an s-class so it's a bit quicker than
my<00:06:52.030> car<00:06:52.270> but<00:06:53.230> that's<00:06:53.380> going<00:06:53.500> to<00:06:53.560> be<00:06:53.650> the<00:06:53.740> end<00:06:53.860> of
