00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
was thinking foul Calvin bath article

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.490 
was thinking foul Calvin bath article
Madrid<00:00:53.180> also<00:00:54.180> Cavani<00:00:54.629> maybe<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.140> Napoli

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
Madrid also Cavani maybe from Napoli

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
Madrid also Cavani maybe from Napoli
because<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:56.039> you've<00:00:56.550> seen<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> next<00:00:57.030> episode

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
because as you've seen the next episode

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.639 
because as you've seen the next episode
we<00:00:57.449> are<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> play<00:00:57.899> Napoli<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.410> he<00:00:58.530> was

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
we are going to play Napoli and he was

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
we are going to play Napoli and he was
absolutely<00:00:58.859> fantastic<00:00:59.160> but<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.300> gonna

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
absolutely fantastic but I'm not gonna

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.970 
absolutely fantastic but I'm not gonna
win<00:01:00.600> anymore<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.710> also<00:01:01.829> thinking

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
win anymore so I was also thinking

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.709 
win anymore so I was also thinking
Ibrahimovic<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.239> doesn't<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.539> much

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
Ibrahimovic I know it doesn't have much

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.600 
Ibrahimovic I know it doesn't have much
left<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.110> him<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.409> he'll<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> good<00:01:05.070> enough<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
left in him but he'll be good enough and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
left in him but he'll be good enough and
and<00:01:05.820> maybe<00:01:06.150> two<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.990> three<00:01:07.020> seasons<00:01:07.650> maybe

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and maybe two to three seasons maybe

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.830 
and maybe two to three seasons maybe

really<00:01:36.479> shame<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> midfield<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.950> good

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
really shame think the midfield is good

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.590 
really shame think the midfield is good
enough<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:38.549> I've<00:01:38.759> bought<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.119> boring<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
enough for now I've bought a boring a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.270 
enough for now I've bought a boring a
lot<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.840> good<00:01:39.869> players<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.439> likes<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.799> Pogba

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and Verratti so I'm also thinking of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
and Verratti so I'm also thinking of

Hummels<00:01:57.810> from<00:01:58.020> Borussia<00:01:58.409> Dortmund<00:01:58.649> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
Hummels from Borussia Dortmund so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
Hummels from Borussia Dortmund so
they're<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.159> two<00:01:59.219> favorite<00:01:59.700> defenders<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
they're my two favorite defenders on the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
they're my two favorite defenders on the
game<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.590> i'll<00:02:01.649> definitely<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> bring

game so i'll definitely like to bring
them<00:02:02.490> into<00:02:02.610> team<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
them into team so in that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.260 
them into team so in that
game<00:02:04.320> 2<00:02:05.159> stayed<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.549> got<00:02:05.670> man<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.909> match<00:02:06.060> so

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
game 2 stayed and got man the match so

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119 
game 2 stayed and got man the match so
moving<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.689> into<00:02:06.990> our<00:02:07.259> next<00:02:07.500> game<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.710> against

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
moving on into our next game is against

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.279 
moving on into our next game is against
Palmer<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.209> key<00:02:09.360> player<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.750> brb<00:02:10.140> ani

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
Palmer and that key player is brb ani

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.199 
Palmer and that key player is brb ani
because<00:02:10.709> he's<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> serial<00:02:11.670> version<00:02:11.819> of

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
because he's like the serial version of

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.240 
because he's like the serial version of
theo<00:02:12.569> walcott<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.680> are<00:02:13.769> currently<00:02:13.920> third

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
theo walcott so we are currently third

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.949 
theo walcott so we are currently third
in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> table<00:02:14.790> four<00:02:15.030> points<00:02:15.060> off<00:02:15.420> Inter<00:02:15.870> Milan

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
in the table four points off Inter Milan

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.479 
in the table four points off Inter Milan
and<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.470> our<00:02:16.560> next<00:02:16.739> game<00:02:17.040> after<00:02:17.340> this

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
and that is our next game after this

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.670 
and that is our next game after this
game<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.629> we<00:02:18.660> win<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:18.930> game<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.349> we<00:02:19.530> went

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
game so if we win this game and we went

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.740 
game so if we win this game and we went
against<00:02:20.099> Inter<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.519> might<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:20.849> top<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.300> depends

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
against Inter we might go top it depends

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.960 
against Inter we might go top it depends
on<00:02:21.840> how<00:02:21.989> Inter<00:02:22.290> Milan<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.739> not<00:02:23.160> top<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:23.610> second

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
on how Inter Milan do not top but second

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.000 
on how Inter Milan do not top but second
I<00:02:24.030> meant<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.019> start<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.319> game<00:02:25.470> as<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> better

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
I meant so we start the game as a better

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.800 
I meant so we start the game as a better
team<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.459> boating<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.330> ball<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.780> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
team and boating on the ball here and

good<00:02:29.880> position<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.390> smashing<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> past<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
good position and smashing it past the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.990 
good position and smashing it past the
goalkeeper<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:32.190> make<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.459> one<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.819> in<00:02:32.910> the
