noon<00:00:24.670> just<00:00:25.000> seemed<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:25.210> work<00:00:25.330> better<00:00:25.390> for<00:00:25.780> me

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
noon just seemed to work better for me

there<00:00:26.020> on<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:26.949> inside<00:00:27.400> of<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.580> box<00:00:27.789> there<00:00:28.210> is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
there on the inside of the box there is

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.460 
there on the inside of the box there is
a<00:00:28.449> switch<00:00:28.720> that<00:00:28.750> allows<00:00:28.960> you<00:00:29.199> to<00:00:29.320> toggle

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
a switch that allows you to toggle

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.920 
a switch that allows you to toggle
between<00:00:29.650> true<00:00:30.430> bypass<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.119> buffered<00:00:31.570> bypass

between true bypass and buffered bypass

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.599 
between true bypass and buffered bypass
mode<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.499> keep<00:00:33.039> in<00:00:33.159> mind<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:33.399> if<00:00:33.519> you're

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:33.609 
mode and keep in mind that if you're

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.889 
mode and keep in mind that if you're
going<00:00:33.699> to<00:00:33.760> use<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.059> buffered<00:00:34.359> bypass<00:00:34.719> you

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
going to use the buffered bypass you

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.299 
going to use the buffered bypass you
always<00:00:35.289> have<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.559> have<00:00:35.589> power<00:00:35.920> going<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.249> the

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
always have to have power going to the

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.450 
always have to have power going to the
pedal<00:00:36.609> even<00:00:37.210> in<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.390> off<00:00:37.510> mode<00:00:38.069> okay<00:00:39.069> now<00:00:39.249> at

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
pedal even in the off mode okay now at

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.759 
pedal even in the off mode okay now at
lower<00:00:39.879> gain<00:00:40.179> settings<00:00:40.659> the<00:00:41.109> pedal<00:00:41.440> just<00:00:41.620> has

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
lower gain settings the pedal just has

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.559 
lower gain settings the pedal just has
all<00:00:41.800> sorts<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.460> great<00:00:42.670> jangle<00:00:43.120> almost<00:00:43.390> kind<00:00:43.539> of

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
all sorts of great jangle almost kind of

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.799 
all sorts of great jangle almost kind of
like<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:43.719> ac30<00:00:44.589> in<00:00:44.859> a<00:00:45.280> box<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:46.239> higher<00:00:46.539> gain

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
like a ac30 in a box and the higher gain

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.079 
like a ac30 in a box and the higher gain
settings<00:00:47.229> it's<00:00:47.379> just<00:00:47.559> wonderfully<00:00:48.100> emotive

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
settings it's just wonderfully emotive

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.059 
settings it's just wonderfully emotive
touch<00:00:49.329> sensitive<00:00:49.839> lots<00:00:50.139> of<00:00:50.350> sustained<00:00:50.739> and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
touch sensitive lots of sustained and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.000 
touch sensitive lots of sustained and
again<00:00:51.579> no<00:00:51.760> blanket<00:00:52.149> over<00:00:52.299> the<00:00:52.389> top<00:00:52.569> your<00:00:52.749> tone

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
again no blanket over the top your tone

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.169 
again no blanket over the top your tone
alright<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.129> first<00:00:54.159> demo<00:00:54.699> is<00:00:54.819> really<00:00:55.059> going

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
alright the first demo is really going

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.189 
alright the first demo is really going
to<00:00:55.269> give<00:00:55.359> you<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.510> chance<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:55.899> kind<00:00:56.049> of<00:00:56.079> hear

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
to give you a chance to kind of hear

to give you a chance to kind of hear
that<00:00:56.379> jangly<00:00:56.799> quality<00:00:57.219> let's<00:00:57.579> check<00:00:57.729> it<00:00:57.850> out

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
that jangly quality let's check it out

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:12.480 
that jangly quality let's check it out
you

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.470 

so<00:01:13.490> for<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.700> second<00:01:14.060> demo<00:01:14.240> I'm<00:01:14.300> actually

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
so for the second demo I'm actually

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.330 
so for the second demo I'm actually
playing<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.960> same<00:01:15.140> part<00:01:15.440> but<00:01:15.950> I've<00:01:16.130> moved

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
playing the same part but I've moved

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.920 
playing the same part but I've moved
from<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.670> neck<00:01:16.880> position<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.690> middle

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
from the neck position to the middle

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.480 
from the neck position to the middle
position<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.470> i've<00:01:18.740> added<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:19.160> stereo

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
position and i've added the stereo

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.760 
position and i've added the stereo
memory<00:01:19.820> mat<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.270> what's<00:01:21.170> really<00:01:21.470> great<00:01:21.710> about

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
memory mat and what's really great about

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.830 
memory mat and what's really great about
this<00:01:22.190> is<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:22.490> allows<00:01:22.730> you<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.000> kind<00:01:23.120> of<00:01:23.270> just

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
this is it allows you to kind of just

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.390 
this is it allows you to kind of just
depending<00:01:24.200> on<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.320> hard<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:24.830> hit<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.070> strings

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
depending on a hard you hit the strings

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.760 
depending on a hard you hit the strings
really<00:01:26.000> emote<00:01:26.570> different<00:01:27.050> types<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.410> textures

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
really emote different types of textures

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.020 
really emote different types of textures
depending<00:01:28.280> on<00:01:28.370> what<00:01:28.520> you're<00:01:28.670> doing<00:01:28.820> with<00:01:28.940> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
depending on what you're doing with the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:45.920 
depending on what you're doing with the
pickup<00:01:29.270> selection<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.870> your<00:01:30.380> pick

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.789 

originally<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:46.960> was<00:01:47.080> thinking<00:01:47.350> about<00:01:47.409> doing<00:01:47.530> a

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
originally I was thinking about doing a

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.020 
originally I was thinking about doing a
base<00:01:47.979> demo<00:01:48.250> because<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:48.640> could<00:01:48.790> tell<00:01:48.909> this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
base demo because I could tell this

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.789 
base demo because I could tell this
would<00:01:49.180> be<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.270> great<00:01:49.540> pedal<00:01:49.869> on<00:01:49.990> base<00:01:50.590> but

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
would be a great pedal on base but

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.190 
would be a great pedal on base but
instead<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.400> pulled<00:01:51.909> out<00:01:52.000> my<00:01:52.060> ibanez<00:01:52.479> 8<00:01:52.810> string

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
instead I pulled out my ibanez 8 string

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.020 
instead I pulled out my ibanez 8 string
and<00:01:53.380> what's<00:01:54.010> neat<00:01:54.190> is<00:01:54.220> adds<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.670> little<00:01:54.790> bit<00:01:54.940> of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
and what's neat is adds a little bit of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.520 
and what's neat is adds a little bit of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and also just a little bit of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.920 
and also just a little bit of
compression<00:01:58.060> when<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.450> hit<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.659> strings
