have in total if you found find all of
them<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:46.430> or<00:03:47.430> in<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.180> case<00:03:48.260> we<00:03:49.260> want<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.650> catch

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
them so or in this case we want to catch

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.850 
them so or in this case we want to catch
a<00:03:50.100> meal<00:03:51.740> so<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.800> got<00:03:52.950> pokédex<00:03:54.080> search<00:03:56.090> go<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
a meal so you got pokédex search go to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.570 
a meal so you got pokédex search go to
name<00:03:59.990> new<00:04:02.840> all<00:04:03.840> right<00:04:04.110> let's<00:04:04.590> see<00:04:04.860> take<00:04:05.550> a

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
name new all right let's see take a

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.980 
name new all right let's see take a
while

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:18.229 

meet<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:13.300> says<00:04:14.550> it's<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.850> one<00:04:16.060> hundred<00:04:16.680> 151

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
meet it says it's that one hundred 151

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:28.260 
meet it says it's that one hundred 151
so<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:23.800> have<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.420> go<00:04:25.420> down<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:28.180> have

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
so you you have to go down to you have

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.260 
so you you have to go down to you have
to<00:04:28.390> subtract<00:04:29.700> you<00:04:30.700> have<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.940> go<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.150> the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
to subtract you have to go to the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:41.700 
to subtract you have to go to the
calculator<00:04:31.450> first<00:04:31.990> one<00:04:39.960> all<00:04:40.960> right<00:04:41.110> here<00:04:41.680> we

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
calculator first one all right here we

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:56.280 
calculator first one all right here we
go<00:04:42.300> here<00:04:44.580> 493<00:04:46.200> minus<00:04:47.550> minus<00:04:48.550> sign<00:04:52.260> 151<00:04:55.290> equals

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
go here 493 minus minus sign 151 equals

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.320 
go here 493 minus minus sign 151 equals
and<00:04:56.620> 151<00:04:57.610> is<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.720> MU<00:04:59.010> so<00:05:00.010> when<00:05:00.640> you<00:05:00.730> equal<00:05:01.180> it

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
and 151 is the MU so when you equal it

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.160 
and 151 is the MU so when you equal it
it's<00:05:01.740> 342<00:05:02.880> so<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:04.030> have<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.270> go<00:05:04.540> down<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
it's 342 so you have to go down to the

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:15.060 
it's 342 so you have to go down to the
bag<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:06.960> toss<00:05:08.250> 342<00:05:09.540> master<00:05:10.540> bowls<00:05:14.070> make

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
bag and toss 342 master bowls make

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.050 
bag and toss 342 master bowls make
things<00:05:15.340> faster<00:05:16.830> don't<00:05:17.830> afford<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.610> master

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
things faster don't afford it to master

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.260 
things faster don't afford it to master
bones

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:34.750
