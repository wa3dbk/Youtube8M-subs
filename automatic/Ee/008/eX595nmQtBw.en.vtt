00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.960 
mind don't worry about it
we're<00:02:18.270> getting<00:02:18.480> about<00:02:18.690> 15<00:02:19.349> 20<00:02:19.890> feet<00:02:20.130> tops<00:02:20.489> out

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
we're getting about 15 20 feet tops out

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630 
we're getting about 15 20 feet tops out
of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> blaster<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.140> suction<00:02:22.620> darts<00:02:22.800> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
of the blaster with the suction darts so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.030 
of the blaster with the suction darts so
let's<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:24.500> firing<00:02:26.090> at<00:02:27.090> our<00:02:27.540> target<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.830> can

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
let's see firing at our target if we can

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.020 
let's see firing at our target if we can
connect<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.910> would<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.810> sweet<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.670> we'll

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
connect that would be sweet and we'll

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.680 
connect that would be sweet and we'll
line<00:02:33.360> up<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.630> shot<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.080> fire<00:02:35.510> definitely<00:02:36.510> have

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
line up a shot and fire definitely have

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.589 
line up a shot and fire definitely have
to<00:02:36.870> calibrate<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.099> pretty<00:02:38.819> severe<00:02:39.269> drop

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599

out<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.230> barrel<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:41.069> is<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> concept

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
out of the barrel there is a concept

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.250 
out of the barrel there is a concept

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
called barrel drag since I'm pretty sure

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.289 
called barrel drag since I'm pretty sure
the<00:02:43.470> effect<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.920> barrel<00:02:44.190> length<00:02:44.370> ends<00:02:44.880> here

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
the effect of barrel length ends here

the effect of barrel length ends here
for<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.870> blaster<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.130> has<00:02:47.340> two<00:02:48.060> feet

a<00:02:53.190> sawed-off<00:02:53.549> blaster<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.780> would<00:02:55.049> have<00:02:55.319> much

a sawed-off blaster it would have much
more<00:02:55.700> efficiency<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.239> we're<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> aim<00:02:57.660> up

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
more efficiency so we're going to aim up

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.020 
more efficiency so we're going to aim up
this<00:02:58.110> time<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.739> there<00:02:59.040> we<00:02:59.160> go<00:02:59.280> we<00:02:59.430> got<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.580> stick

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
this time and there we go we got a stick

this time and there we go we got a stick
so<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.930> one<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.319> not<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.819> performance<00:03:02.819> piece

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
so this one is not a performance piece

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.410 
so this one is not a performance piece
by<00:03:03.780> any<00:03:04.019> means<00:03:04.319> but<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:04.799> very<00:03:05.489> realistic<00:03:06.330> in

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420

it's<00:03:16.260> got<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.440> great<00:03:16.980> design<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.790> terms<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.269> like

a<00:03:23.820> very<00:03:24.150> nice<00:03:24.329> touch<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.840> wonder<00:03:25.109> if<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.350> is

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
a very nice touch I wonder if this is

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.910 
a very nice touch I wonder if this is
actual<00:03:25.859> storage<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:27.090> anything<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:28.319> does<00:03:28.890> not

actual storage for anything it does not

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.740 
actual storage for anything it does not
appear<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.030> let's<00:03:30.209> come<00:03:30.480> back

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
appear that it is so let's come back

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.470 
appear that it is so let's come back
over<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.560> just<00:03:32.459> take<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> quick<00:03:32.940> look<00:03:33.209> see<00:03:33.390> if

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
over here just take a quick look see if

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.780 
over here just take a quick look see if
there<00:03:33.660> are<00:03:33.690> any<00:03:33.750> extra<00:03:34.260> features<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.670> am

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
there are any extra features that I am

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.539 
there are any extra features that I am
not<00:03:36.030> covering<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.750> don't<00:03:37.380> believe<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:38.069> there

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
not covering I don't believe that there

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.300 
not covering I don't believe that there
are<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:39.079> hmm<00:03:40.079> that's<00:03:40.290> interesting<00:03:41.160> there

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
are and hmm that's interesting there

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.449 
are and hmm that's interesting there
doesn't<00:03:41.700> seem<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:42.000> be<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.540> range<00:03:43.230> claim<00:03:43.650> on<00:03:43.920> this

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
doesn't seem to be a range claim on this

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.460 
doesn't seem to be a range claim on this
blaster<00:03:44.940> which<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.209> probably<00:03:45.600> for<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.290> best

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
blaster which is probably for the best

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.349 
blaster which is probably for the best
given<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.130> its<00:03:48.090> ranges<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.900> rather<00:03:49.620> short

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
given that its ranges are rather short

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.930 
given that its ranges are rather short
so<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.889> short<00:03:52.889> range<00:03:53.100> for<00:03:53.430> firing<00:03:53.639> at<00:03:53.910> targets

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
so a short range for firing at targets

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.080 
so a short range for firing at targets
this<00:03:54.389> would<00:03:54.540> be<00:03:54.660> great<00:03:55.410> for<00:03:55.950> playing<00:03:56.220> inside<00:03:56.730> I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
this would be great for playing inside I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.449 
this would be great for playing inside I
think<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.600> it's<00:03:58.079> virtually<00:03:58.380> harmless<00:03:58.980> which

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
think that it's virtually harmless which

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.009 
think that it's virtually harmless which
is<00:03:59.609> awesome<00:04:01.220> if<00:04:02.220> you're<00:04:02.970> ducking<00:04:03.540> around<00:04:03.810> like

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
is awesome if you're ducking around like

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.660 
is awesome if you're ducking around like
lamps<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.530> stuff<00:04:04.650> similar<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.220> how<00:04:05.340> like<00:04:05.519> the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
lamps and stuff similar to how like the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.229 
lamps and stuff similar to how like the
old<00:04:05.819> NRF<00:04:06.780> balls<00:04:07.079> were<00:04:07.380> none<00:04:08.040> Rick<00:04:08.549> or<00:04:08.790> non

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
old NRF balls were none Rick or non

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.620 
old NRF balls were none Rick or non

expanding recreational foam and their
big<00:04:12.780> marketing<00:04:13.260> strategy<00:04:13.709> was<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:14.010> they

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
big marketing strategy was that they

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.789 
big marketing strategy was that they
were<00:04:14.190> safe<00:04:14.459> for<00:04:14.639> indoor<00:04:14.940> play<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.260> my

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
were safe for indoor play so that is my

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
like that again I don't really think

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.020 
like that again I don't really think
that<00:04:31.830> that's<00:04:31.919> what<00:04:32.039> this<00:04:32.280> company<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.639> going

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that that's what this company is going

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.149 
that that's what this company is going
for<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:33.479> it<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> big<00:04:34.259> focal<00:04:34.710> point<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:35.099> my

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
for but it is a big focal point of my

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.360 
for but it is a big focal point of my
channel<00:04:35.580> is<00:04:35.909> making<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:37.370> displaying

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370

performance<00:04:39.090> piece<00:04:39.300> blasters<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.349> wanted

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
performance piece blasters so I wanted

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.740 
performance piece blasters so I wanted
to<00:04:41.069> cover<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.669> all<00:04:42.090> in<00:04:42.300> all<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.449> think<00:04:42.569> that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
to cover that all in all I think that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.629 
to cover that all in all I think that
it's<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.139> fine<00:04:43.740> product<00:04:44.099> for<00:04:44.400> what<00:04:44.520> it's

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
it's a a fine product for what it's

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.570 
it's a a fine product for what it's
trying<00:04:44.849> to<00:04:44.970> accomplish<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.720> its<00:04:46.530> form<00:04:47.400> and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
trying to accomplish and its form and

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.149 
trying to accomplish and its form and
function<00:04:48.090> is<00:04:48.389> is<00:04:48.750> very<00:04:49.020> nice<00:04:49.319> I<00:04:49.590> really<00:04:49.949> like

this<00:04:50.819> system<00:04:51.360> of<00:04:51.479> breach<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:51.930> just<00:04:52.110> wish<00:04:52.349> that

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
this system of breach I just wish that

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.980 
this system of breach I just wish that
it<00:04:53.099> was<00:04:53.280> an<00:04:53.460> actual<00:04:53.909> airtight<00:04:54.419> breach<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:54.870> it

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
it was an actual airtight breach and it

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.839 
it was an actual airtight breach and it
was<00:04:55.080> getting<00:04:55.379> that<00:04:55.560> kind<00:04:56.159> of<00:04:56.280> performance

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
was getting that kind of performance

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.450 
was getting that kind of performance
that<00:04:56.909> I'd<00:04:57.090> expect<00:04:57.539> out<00:04:58.139> of<00:04:58.199> another<00:04:58.830> kind<00:04:59.250> of

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
that I'd expect out of another kind of

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.210 
that I'd expect out of another kind of
blaster<00:04:59.970> so<00:05:00.750> that's<00:05:01.229> my<00:05:01.380> review<00:05:01.650> as<00:05:01.889> always
