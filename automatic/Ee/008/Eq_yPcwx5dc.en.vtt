00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.220 
going for I'm going to add a few
highlights<00:00:23.910> around<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> front<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
highlights around the front just to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.560 
highlights around the front just to
frame<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.680> face<00:00:25.939> because<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.270> already

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
frame the face because there is already

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
frame the face because there is already
colored<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> think<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> most<00:00:28.439> important<00:00:28.949> thing

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
colored I think the most important thing

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.340 
colored I think the most important thing
to<00:00:29.310> remember<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.850> that<00:00:30.060> tint<00:00:30.630> won't<00:00:30.900> light<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
to remember is that tint won't light and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.780 
to remember is that tint won't light and
tint<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.039> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> need<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> use<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
tint so we're going to need to use a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.270 
tint so we're going to need to use a
bleach<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.540> lighten<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> hair<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:35.220> to
