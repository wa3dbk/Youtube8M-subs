00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
my exploits I posted this video mainly

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.580 
my exploits I posted this video mainly
because<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.810> main<00:00:30.929> point<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.529> show

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
because it's the main point is to show

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560 
because it's the main point is to show
you<00:00:31.710> guys<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.700> don't<00:00:32.880> necessarily<00:00:33.030> have

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you guys that you don't necessarily have

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.350 
you guys that you don't necessarily have
to<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.200> greatest<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.920> or<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to be the greatest of or have the

to be the greatest of or have the
greatest<00:00:36.540> skill<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:38.040> play<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.370> game<00:00:38.579> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
greatest skill to play this game you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
greatest skill to play this game you
just<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.629> good<00:00:39.750> tactics<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just have to have good tactics and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.590 
just have to have good tactics and
you'll<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> bunch<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.969> times<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.420> this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you'll see a bunch of times in this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
you'll see a bunch of times in this
video<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.079> aim<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.920> ridiculously<00:00:44.550> off

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
video my aim is like ridiculously off

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.810 
video my aim is like ridiculously off
and<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.899> main<00:00:46.020> reason<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.010> uh<00:00:47.039> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and the main reason for that is uh this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
and the main reason for that is uh this
was<00:00:48.059> why<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.239> think<00:00:48.690> first<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.350> second<00:00:49.680> game

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
was why I think first or second game

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.580 
was why I think first or second game
back<00:00:49.829> after<00:00:50.520> playing<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.690> couple<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> days<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
back after playing a couple of days of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.330 
back after playing a couple of days of
the<00:00:53.070> halo<00:00:53.250> reach<00:00:53.579> beta<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.890> always<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the halo reach beta and always see the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
the halo reach beta and always see the
controls<00:00:56.789> physics<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> dynamics<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
controls physics and dynamics of that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.910 
controls physics and dynamics of that
game<00:00:58.920> arc<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.309> especially<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> controller

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
game arc and especially the controller

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.729 
game arc and especially the controller
360<00:01:01.920> controller<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.460> ps3<00:01:02.730> controller<00:01:03.300> are

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
360 controller to ps3 controller are

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.560 
360 controller to ps3 controller are
completely<00:01:04.739> different<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:06.060> aim<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> kind

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
completely different so my aim is kind

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690 
completely different so my aim is kind
of<00:01:06.659> off<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> first<00:01:07.530> couple<00:01:07.650> games<00:01:07.830> but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
of off for the first couple games but

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
of off for the first couple games but
this<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.810> goes<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> show<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this just goes to show you that you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
this just goes to show you that you
don't<00:01:10.920> necessarily<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.810> best

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
don't necessarily have to have the best

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.440 
don't necessarily have to have the best
shot<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> game<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.490> successful<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
shot in the game to be successful at it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.630 
shot in the game to be successful at it
you<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.890> general

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you just have to have good general

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.070 
you just have to have good general
tactics<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> map<00:01:18.720> knowledge<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.540> we'll

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
tactics and map knowledge so so we'll

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.179 
tactics and map knowledge so so we'll
get<00:01:22.290> started<00:01:23.090> first<00:01:24.090> tip<00:01:24.390> an<00:01:24.540> overgrown<00:01:25.189> don't

so carrier stingers and shoot down your

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.589 
so carrier stingers and shoot down your
support<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.819> off<00:01:48.969> comes<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.240> sequence

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
support and this off comes the sequence

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.120 
support and this off comes the sequence
is<00:01:49.719> pretty<00:01:49.899> bad<00:01:50.079> as<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.409> can<00:01:50.530> see<00:01:50.649> with<00:01:50.770> my<00:01:50.920> aim

Rothko's which are always lovely which
is<00:01:59.319> in<00:01:59.709> long<00:02:00.039> run<00:02:00.310> with<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> bad<00:02:00.670> move<00:02:00.880> because<00:02:01.000> I

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
is in long run with a bad move because I

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.459 
is in long run with a bad move because I
had<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.479> waste<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.780> predator<00:02:02.049> missile<00:02:02.319> to

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
had to waste the predator missile to

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.100 
had to waste the predator missile to
shoot<00:02:02.649> down<00:02:02.739> by<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.009> Harrier<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:04.119> back<00:02:04.959> on
