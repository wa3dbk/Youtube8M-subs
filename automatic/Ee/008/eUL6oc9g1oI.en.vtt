this<00:00:46.260> new<00:00:46.590> motorcycle<00:00:47.630> starting<00:00:48.630> off<00:00:48.780> with

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
this new motorcycle starting off with

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860 
this new motorcycle starting off with
the<00:00:49.080> motor<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.760> rips<00:00:50.760> off<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.360> bottom<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the motor it rips off the bottom it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
the motor it rips off the bottom it
literally<00:00:52.380> has<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> ton<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> snap<00:00:53.700> it's<00:00:54.060> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
literally has a ton of snap it's the

literally has a ton of snap it's the
most<00:00:54.600> I've<00:00:54.870> felt<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.470> 250f<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.970> in<00:00:57.330> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
most I've felt on the 250f and in a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
most I've felt on the 250f and in a
while<00:00:57.600> since<00:00:58.020> carbureted<00:00:58.620> bikes<00:00:58.800> rips

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
while since carbureted bikes rips

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
while since carbureted bikes rips
through<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.700> mid<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.559> top

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
through the mid all the way into the top

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.420 
through the mid all the way into the top
it<00:01:02.129> does<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.120> slight<00:01:04.080> flat<00:01:04.680> spot<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.339> if

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it does have a slight flat spot but if

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.010 
it does have a slight flat spot but if
you're<00:01:05.610> revving<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.210> bar<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.660> need<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
you're revving that bar you need to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.630 
you're revving that bar you need to
shift<00:01:07.229> anyways<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:07.979> say<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> little

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
shift anyways I will say it's a little

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
shift anyways I will say it's a little
loud<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.510> muffler<00:01:09.869> definitely<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.440> loud<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
loud the muffler definitely is loud if I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.249 
loud the muffler definitely is loud if I
had<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.280> pick<00:01:11.430> something<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.910> it's<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.960> short

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
had to pick something out it's so short

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.010 
had to pick something out it's so short
seems<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.040> better<00:01:14.910> for<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.450> case<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> crash

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
seems to be better for a case you crash

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
seems to be better for a case you crash
it's<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.440> so<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.649> there<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.399> slammed<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it's not so out there to get slammed the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's not so out there to get slammed the
cockpit<00:01:18.780> feels<00:01:19.050> good<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.649> will<00:01:20.250> say<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> bike

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
cockpit feels good I will say the bike

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.020 
cockpit feels good I will say the bike
feels<00:01:21.450> slightly<00:01:22.130> wide<00:01:23.130> compared<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.940> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
feels slightly wide compared to the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.550 
feels slightly wide compared to the
other<00:01:24.180> two<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.540> DF<00:01:24.750> sitting<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.410> it's

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
other two bit DF sitting on it it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.680 
other two bit DF sitting on it it's
still<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.800> little<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.430> wide<00:01:26.640> bike<00:01:26.910> but<00:01:27.540> as

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
still a little bit of a wide bike but as

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.170 
still a little bit of a wide bike but as
for<00:01:27.960> turning<00:01:28.440> we<00:01:29.190> stiffened<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.940> front

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
for turning we stiffened up the front

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.430 
for turning we stiffened up the front
end<00:01:30.360> -<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:31.100> stock<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:33.180> felt<00:01:34.020> good<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
end - from stock and it felt good in the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.570 
end - from stock and it felt good in the
bum

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.580 

I'm<00:01:38.120> glad<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.630> Yamaha<00:01:38.960> stuck<00:01:39.320> with<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
I'm glad that Yamaha stuck with the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.380 
I'm glad that Yamaha stuck with the
spring<00:01:39.920> fork<00:01:40.220> instead<00:01:40.550> of<00:01:40.730> going<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.240> air

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
spring fork instead of going to the air

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.090 
spring fork instead of going to the air
because<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.080> personally<00:01:42.590> don't<00:01:42.800> think<00:01:42.980> that

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
because I personally don't think that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.090 
because I personally don't think that
the<00:01:43.190> air<00:01:43.370> is<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:44.210> proven<00:01:44.810> yet<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.620> suspension

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the air is is proven yet this suspension

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.760 
the air is is proven yet this suspension

I'm not a huge fan of had to nitpick the
bars<00:01:53.450> that's<00:01:54.200> strictly<00:01:54.800> just<00:01:55.130> me<00:01:55.370> not<00:01:55.610> like

him<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.780> bike<00:01:57.020> shifted<00:01:57.800> well<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.280> new

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
him this bike shifted well the new

him this bike shifted well the new
transmission<00:01:59.240> for<00:01:59.750> valve<00:02:00.020> head<00:02:00.410> the

transmission for valve head the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.770 
transmission for valve head the
wraparound<00:02:01.430> pipe<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.970> all<00:02:02.210> seems<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.660> be<00:02:02.750> a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
wraparound pipe it all seems to be a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.480 
wraparound pipe it all seems to be a
great<00:02:03.080> package<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.800> worked<00:02:03.980> well<00:02:04.190> together

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
great package and worked well together

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.840 
great package and worked well together
comparing<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.650> 2014<00:02:06.650> Yamaha<00:02:07.040> 250<00:02:07.340> F<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:07.730> the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
comparing the 2014 Yamaha 250 F to the

comparing the 2014 Yamaha 250 F to the
2013<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.050> really<00:02:10.040> have<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.310> say<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.850> overall

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
2013 I really have to say that overall

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.020 
2013 I really have to say that overall
package<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.620> worth<00:02:12.890> spending<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.760> money<00:02:13.940> that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
package is worth spending the money that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.180
