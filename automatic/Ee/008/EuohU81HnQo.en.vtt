alright<00:00:02.070> I'm<00:00:02.190> about<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.520> do<00:00:02.639> one<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.939> the

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
alright I'm about to do one of the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.559 
alright I'm about to do one of the
things<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.419> absolutely<00:00:04.009> hate<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.160> do<00:00:05.569> cutting

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
things I absolutely hate to do cutting

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.030 
things I absolutely hate to do cutting
into<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.810> harness<00:00:07.970> but<00:00:09.200> actually<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> TSB

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
into the harness but actually have a TSB

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.410 
into the harness but actually have a TSB
from<00:00:11.690> KMA<00:00:12.690> for<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.250> DTC<00:00:14.250> pl0<00:00:15.030> 3-0<00:00:16.279> got<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
from KMA for this DTC pl0 3-0 got a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.269 
from KMA for this DTC pl0 3-0 got a
little<00:00:18.420> terminal<00:00:18.810> kit<00:00:19.279> from<00:00:20.279> from<00:00:21.090> Korea<00:00:22.279> some

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
little terminal kit from from Korea some

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.519 
little terminal kit from from Korea some
heat-shrink<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> old<00:00:24.779> soldering<00:00:25.230> iron

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
heat-shrink got the old soldering iron

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.300 
heat-shrink got the old soldering iron
out<00:00:26.060> stripped<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> harness<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.310> got

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
out stripped the harness out and got

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.669 
out stripped the harness out and got
these<00:00:29.490> two<00:00:29.820> wires<00:00:30.779> pulled<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
these two wires pulled out of the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.400 
these two wires pulled out of the
terminal<00:00:32.130> block<00:00:32.780> with<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> couple<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.230> tools

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
terminal block with a couple of tools

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.950 
terminal block with a couple of tools
and<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:36.300> TSB<00:00:36.750> wants<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> cut<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:38.010> off

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
and the TSB wants you to cut these off

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.139 
and the TSB wants you to cut these off
heat<00:00:39.960> shrink<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.410> solder<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:42.000> they

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
heat shrink and solder and then they

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
heat shrink and solder and then they
have<00:00:42.360> obviously<00:00:43.260> they've<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> different

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
have obviously they've got a different

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.860 
have obviously they've got a different
connector<00:00:45.530> terminal<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:46.950> that

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
connector terminal on here that

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.150 
connector terminal on here that
hopefully<00:00:48.870> has<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.410> more<00:00:49.440> mechanical

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
hopefully has a lot more mechanical

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
hopefully has a lot more mechanical
tension<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.670> that'll<00:00:51.420> keep<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.780> check

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
tension on it that'll keep that check

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
tension on it that'll keep that check
engine<00:00:52.559> light<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.890> coming<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.250> popping<00:00:53.640> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
engine light from coming on popping that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.010 
engine light from coming on popping that
code<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.370> hate<00:00:57.120> cutting<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
code so I hate cutting into the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
code so I hate cutting into the
harnesses<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.800> especially<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.399> o2

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
harnesses like this especially the o2

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.900 
harnesses like this especially the o2
sensor<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:01.649> feed<00:01:02.010> line<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
sensor that feed line going back to the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
sensor that feed line going back to the
ECU<00:01:03.329> has<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> open<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:05.010> can't<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.430> any

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
ECU has to be open they can't be any

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.929 
ECU has to be open they can't be any
solder<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.390> anything<00:01:06.570> blocking<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
solder or anything blocking the

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.250 
solder or anything blocking the
conductors<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> air<00:01:09.750> sample<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
conductors for that air sample to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.370 
conductors for that air sample to
breathe<00:01:10.470> through<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> sensor<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.659> that's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
breathe through that sensor so that's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.490 
breathe through that sensor so that's
why<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.830> hate<00:01:14.340> doing<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
why I hate doing this but this is the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
why I hate doing this but this is the
heater<00:01:16.740> circuit<00:01:17.600> it's<00:01:19.340> not<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> sensor<00:01:20.729> line

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
heater circuit it's not the sensor line

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.990 
heater circuit it's not the sensor line
going<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> PCM<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.610> shouldn't<00:01:23.939> be

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
going back to the PCM so it shouldn't be

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.160 
going back to the PCM so it shouldn't be
an<00:01:24.090> issue<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> heater<00:01:24.900> circuit

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
an issue here with the heater circuit

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.219 
an issue here with the heater circuit
just<00:01:25.470> twelve<00:01:25.740> volts<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.720> current<00:01:27.750> from

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
just twelve volts and the current from

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:28.880 
just twelve volts and the current from
the<00:01:28.350> ECU

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the ECU

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.249 
the ECU
or<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> PCM<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.180> run<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> o2<00:01:30.750> sensor<00:01:31.049> heater

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
or the PCM to run the o2 sensor heater

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.330 
or the PCM to run the o2 sensor heater
and<00:01:32.270> hopefully<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.420> terminal<00:01:33.900> ends<00:01:34.049> here

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
and hopefully these terminal ends here

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.469 
and hopefully these terminal ends here
will<00:01:35.340> take<00:01:35.610> care<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> problem<00:01:36.360> I've<00:01:36.450> got

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
will take care of the problem I've got

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870 
will take care of the problem I've got
two<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> o2<00:01:37.770> sensor<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.759> in

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
two for the o2 sensor and out here in

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
two for the o2 sensor and out here in
the<00:01:38.970> engine<00:01:39.270> bay<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> I've<00:01:40.259> got<00:01:40.470> two<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.340> for

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the engine bay and I've got two more for

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.920 
the engine bay and I've got two more for
the<00:01:41.729> PCM<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.509> ECU<00:01:42.840> connector<00:01:43.369> up<00:01:44.369> inside<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
the PCM the ECU connector up inside the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.969 
the PCM the ECU connector up inside the
passenger<00:01:45.930> compartment<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.619> end<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
passenger compartment on the end of the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.460 
passenger compartment on the end of the
harness<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.600> we'll<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> first

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
harness but so we'll do this and first

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.370 
harness but so we'll do this and first
and<00:01:50.030> see<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.090> she<00:01:51.240> snaps<00:01:51.540> another<00:01:51.840> coat<00:01:52.079> or<00:01:52.259> not

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and see if she snaps another coat or not

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
and see if she snaps another coat or not
I<00:01:52.560> hope<00:01:52.710> she<00:01:52.920> doesn't<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.700> really

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I hope she doesn't because I really

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.219 
I hope she doesn't because I really
don't<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> go<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.869> cut<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
don't want to go in there and cut the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.080 
don't want to go in there and cut the
other<00:01:55.350> end<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> harness<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.159> that's<00:01:56.880> one

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
other end of the harness up that's one

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.649 
other end of the harness up that's one
thing<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.420> absolutely<00:01:57.810> hate<00:01:58.200> doing<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> well

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
thing I absolutely hate doing so well

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.980 
thing I absolutely hate doing so well
we'll<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> done<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.479> watch<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.719> check

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
we'll get it done and watch that check

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.149 
we'll get it done and watch that check
engine<00:02:04.140> light<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.590> she<00:02:04.710> snaps<00:02:04.950> off

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
engine light see if she snaps off

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.920 
engine light see if she snaps off
another<00:02:05.399> o2<00:02:05.700> sensor<00:02:06.000> heater<00:02:06.180> circuit<00:02:06.659> coat

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
pl0 3-0 hopefully no been a great little

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.530 
pl0 3-0 hopefully no been a great little
car<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.489> almost<00:02:11.670> two<00:02:11.819> hundred<00:02:11.879> thousand<00:02:12.450> on

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
car it's almost two hundred thousand on

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.520 
car it's almost two hundred thousand on
it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.120 
it
once<00:02:14.490> every<00:02:14.880> few<00:02:15.690> months<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.320> light<00:02:16.890> will<00:02:17.040> come

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
once every few months it light will come

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.010 
once every few months it light will come
on<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:19.080> already<00:02:19.260> had<00:02:19.470> another<00:02:19.680> o2<00:02:20.040> sensor

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
on so it's already had another o2 sensor

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.850 
on so it's already had another o2 sensor
so<00:02:22.020> we're<00:02:22.230> not<00:02:22.320> going<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.530> throw<00:02:22.710> any<00:02:22.830> more

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
so we're not going to throw any more

time<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.970> TSB<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:25.350> gonna<00:02:25.470> knock<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:26.010> Z

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
time to TSB we're gonna knock it out Z
