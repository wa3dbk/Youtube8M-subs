the looks at the moment it's got the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.020 
the looks at the moment it's got the

same grid layout of content and news

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.330 
same grid layout of content and news
printed<00:01:58.420> across<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.899> window<00:01:59.259> but<00:01:59.920> is<00:02:00.070> lacking

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
printed across the window but is lacking

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.010 
printed across the window but is lacking
the<00:02:00.610> ability<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:01.210> view<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.600> relevant

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
the ability to view the relevant

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.380 
the ability to view the relevant
information<00:02:02.289> in<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.979> client<00:02:03.399> unlike<00:02:04.179> the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
information in the client unlike the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.710 
information in the client unlike the
patcher<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:06.189> as<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.429> mentioned<00:02:06.460> earlier<00:02:07.030> riot

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
patcher but as I mentioned earlier riot

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.839 
patcher but as I mentioned earlier riot
will<00:02:07.899> be<00:02:08.019> working<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.500> client<00:02:08.860> later<00:02:08.979> so

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
will be working on the client later so

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.610 
will be working on the client later so
all<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.149> other<00:02:10.300> pages<00:02:10.599> may<00:02:10.899> look<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.140> same<00:02:11.290> at

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
all the other pages may look the same at

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.350 
all the other pages may look the same at
the<00:02:11.650> moment<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:12.519> it's<00:02:12.700> probably<00:02:13.000> going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.269> be

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
the moment but it's probably going to be

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.600 
the moment but it's probably going to be
changed<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.930> lot<00:02:14.230> when<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.709> gets<00:02:14.980> released<00:02:15.190> onto

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
changed a lot when it gets released onto

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.410 
changed a lot when it gets released onto
the<00:02:15.849> live<00:02:16.030> servers<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.760> only<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.120> sneak

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the live servers so this is only a sneak

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.210 
the live servers so this is only a sneak
peek<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.959> new<00:02:20.170> patcher<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.739> client<00:02:21.069> right

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
now so we haven't seen the full

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.500 
now so we haven't seen the full
potential<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.890> capabilities<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.150> client
