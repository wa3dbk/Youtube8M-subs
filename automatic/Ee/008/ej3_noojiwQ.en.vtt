verizon<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.319> would<00:03:15.769> say<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.920> charge<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.370> the

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
verizon I would say the charge is the

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.099 
verizon I would say the charge is the
best<00:03:16.700> battery<00:03:16.940> life<00:03:17.239> but<00:03:17.720> you're<00:03:17.840> getting<00:03:18.049> a

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
best battery life but you're getting a

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.190 
best battery life but you're getting a
fifteen<00:03:18.829> hundred<00:03:19.040> million<00:03:19.190> battery<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.959> it's

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
fifteen hundred million battery so it's

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.710 
fifteen hundred million battery so it's
probably<00:03:21.290> good<00:03:21.680> for<00:03:21.739> about<00:03:21.950> 5-6<00:03:22.670> hours<00:03:22.790> you

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
probably good for about 5-6 hours you

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440 
probably good for about 5-6 hours you
get<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.870> 16<00:03:24.290> gigabyte<00:03:24.470> SD<00:03:24.980> card<00:03:25.340> included<00:03:26.269> and

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
of course you get your LD the 4g LTE sim

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.890 
of course you get your LD the 4g LTE sim
