this before this is the first pineapple
I've<00:00:14.880> tried<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> let's<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.160> how<00:00:17.310> it

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I've tried it on so let's see how it

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.510 
I've tried it on so let's see how it
goes<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.470> first<00:00:19.650> thing<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.949> tells<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> do

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
goes the first thing it tells you to do

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.550 
goes the first thing it tells you to do
is<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.910> cut<00:00:21.119> off<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> top<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.990> pineapple

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.630 

that's<00:00:31.560> done<00:00:33.440> then<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.890> measure<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> height

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's done then to measure the height

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.150 
that's done then to measure the height
of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.940> pineapple<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> markings<00:00:37.829> on

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the shaft of the slicer step 2 is to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
the shaft of the slicer step 2 is to
hold<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.430> pineapple<00:00:48.210> while<00:00:48.539> pushing<00:00:49.020> firmly

done<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:54.970> it<00:03:55.970> comes<00:03:57.310> okay<00:03:59.650> well<00:04:00.650> it's<00:04:01.310> a

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
done this it comes okay well it's a

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.860 
done this it comes okay well it's a
little<00:04:02.090> bit<00:04:02.299> messy<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.610> suspect<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.480> me

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
little bit messy but I suspect that me

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.559 
little bit messy but I suspect that me
rather<00:04:06.409> than<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.920> machine<00:04:07.670> but<00:04:07.939> actually<00:04:08.450> you

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
rather than the machine but actually you

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.690 
rather than the machine but actually you
can<00:04:08.720> see<00:04:08.930> exactly<00:04:09.260> what<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.680> does<00:04:09.860> look<00:04:10.549> at

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
can see exactly what it does look at

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.250 
can see exactly what it does look at
that<00:04:10.879> isn't<00:04:11.420> that<00:04:11.599> fabulous

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
that isn't that fabulous

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.740 
that isn't that fabulous
and<00:04:12.620> probably<00:04:13.489> be<00:04:13.819> pushed<00:04:14.030> in<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.209> bit<00:04:14.360> harder

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
and probably be pushed in a bit harder

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.310 
and probably be pushed in a bit harder
you<00:04:14.780> get<00:04:15.019> thicker<00:04:15.290> thicker<00:04:16.039> rings<00:04:17.140> okay<00:04:18.140> I

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
you get thicker thicker rings okay I

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.340 
you get thicker thicker rings okay I
need<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.769> clean<00:04:18.979> up<00:04:19.099> now
