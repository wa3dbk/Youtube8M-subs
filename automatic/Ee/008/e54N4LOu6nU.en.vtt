the ambient temperature and humidity so

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.860 
the ambient temperature and humidity so
is<00:00:37.180> probably<00:00:37.960> one<00:00:38.380> of<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:39.070> most<00:00:39.220> critical

performance for qualifying race finally
it<00:02:24.790> has<00:02:24.940> now<00:02:25.390> become<00:02:25.599> quite<00:02:26.200> apparent<00:02:26.530> that

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
it has now become quite apparent that

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.300 
it has now become quite apparent that
prepared<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.400> last<00:02:27.610> year<00:02:27.849> a<00:02:28.030> Ferrari<00:02:28.390> has<00:02:28.569> made

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
prepared to last year a Ferrari has made

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.410 
prepared to last year a Ferrari has made
significant<00:02:30.310> step<00:02:30.489> forward<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:31.090> terms<00:02:31.239> of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
significant step forward in terms of

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.259 
significant step forward in terms of
power<00:02:31.659> unit<00:02:31.989> performance<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.180> think

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
power unit performance so do you think

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.449 
power unit performance so do you think
the<00:02:34.690> podium<00:02:35.379> finishing<00:02:35.829> Melba<00:02:36.159> would<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:36.430> a

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
the podium finishing Melba would be a

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.170 
the podium finishing Melba would be a
feasible<00:02:37.019> achievement<00:02:38.019> in<00:02:38.319> this<00:02:38.560> track<00:02:38.799> also

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
feasible achievement in this track also

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.089 
feasible achievement in this track also
we<00:02:40.180> think<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.690> performance<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.950> hog

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
we think that the performance of the hog

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.610 
we think that the performance of the hog
we're<00:02:42.250> doing<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:42.700> also<00:02:42.879> of<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.180> car<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:44.230> at

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
we're doing but also of the car is at

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.479 
we're doing but also of the car is at
the<00:02:44.709> moment<00:02:45.360> able<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.599> guarantee<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:48.069> maintain

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
the moment able to guarantee to maintain

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.420 
the moment able to guarantee to maintain
the<00:02:48.670> second<00:02:49.000> position<00:02:49.890> for<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> first<00:02:51.250> part

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
the second position for the first part

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.460 
the second position for the first part
of<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.760> season<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.480> think<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.989> also<00:02:53.319> i

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
of the season so I think that also i

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.869 
of the season so I think that also i
think<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.859> i<00:02:53.920> hope<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.099> also<00:02:54.519> in<00:02:54.609> malaysia

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
think and i hope that also in malaysia

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.009 
think and i hope that also in malaysia
we<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.859> reach<00:02:56.859> the<00:02:57.160> podium<00:02:57.540> visit<00:02:58.540> anyway<00:02:58.810> for

we can reach the podium visit anyway for

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.509 
we can reach the podium visit anyway for
us<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.349> starting<00:02:59.829> point<00:03:00.010> because<00:03:00.400> our

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
us is a starting point because our

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.220 
us is a starting point because our
target<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.239> second<00:03:01.510> part<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.930> season

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
target in the second part of the season

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.229 
target in the second part of the season
or<00:03:02.290> as<00:03:02.410> soon<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:02.650> possible<00:03:03.099> is<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.220> arrive<00:03:03.549> in

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
or as soon as possible is to arrive in

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.259 
or as soon as possible is to arrive in
as<00:03:05.019> close<00:03:05.739> as<00:03:05.950> possible<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.400> my<00:03:06.609> channel<00:03:06.909> so<00:03:07.060> i

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
as close as possible to my channel so i

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.030 
as close as possible to my channel so i
think<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:08.019> can<00:03:08.140> maintain<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.739> second

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
think that we can maintain the second

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.009 
think that we can maintain the second
position<00:03:09.220> also<00:03:09.760> for<00:03:10.000> malaysia<00:03:10.299> but<00:03:10.599> we<00:03:10.900> have

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
position also for malaysia but we have

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.960 
position also for malaysia but we have
to<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.530> take<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.859> future<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.430> provide<00:03:12.849> as

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
to to take to the future to provide as

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.430 
to to take to the future to provide as
soon<00:03:13.090> as<00:03:13.209> possible<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.750> first

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.500
