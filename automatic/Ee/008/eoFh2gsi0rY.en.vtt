I'm very accurate to need a couple of
times<00:00:14.190> we've<00:00:14.370> seen<00:00:14.549> him<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.790> screen<00:00:17.779> one<00:00:18.779> thing

times we've seen him on screen one thing
to<00:00:19.050> note<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.250> modified<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.119> axe<00:00:21.330> on

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
to note is I have modified the axe on

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.150 
to note is I have modified the axe on
mine<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.500> shorter<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.039> more

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
mine to be a little shorter and more

mine to be a little shorter and more
show<00:00:23.430> accurate<00:00:23.640> normally<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> would<00:00:24.500> come<00:00:25.500> up

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
show accurate normally it would come up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.349 
show accurate normally it would come up
under<00:00:26.010> his<00:00:26.099> fist<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> handle<00:00:27.060> would<00:00:27.119> fold

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
under his fist and the handle would fold

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.670 
under his fist and the handle would fold
back<00:00:27.630> around<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> through<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.560> I've<00:00:28.619> just

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
back around and through but I've just

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.600 
back around and through but I've just
got<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> plugged<00:00:29.250> straight<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.610> that

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
got it plugged straight in like so that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.979 
got it plugged straight in like so that
you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:32.969> normally<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.420> piece<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.809> much

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you can see normally this piece is much

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.270 
you can see normally this piece is much
longer<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.590> would<00:00:34.710> flip<00:00:34.920> around<00:00:35.040> like

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
longer and it would flip around like

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.430 
longer and it would flip around like
this<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:36.420> actually<00:00:36.570> come<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:37.020> about<00:00:37.110> here

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this that actually come out about here

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.530 
this that actually come out about here
and<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> would<00:00:37.739> plug<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:41.540> but

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and it would plug in like that but

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.700 
and it would plug in like that but
there's<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> axe<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:45.559> set<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
there's the axe that I use I set that to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.910 
there's the axe that I use I set that to
the<00:00:46.800> side<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.340> transform<00:00:47.940> him<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:49.230> pop<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the side to transform him you pop up the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.510 
the side to transform him you pop up the
top<00:00:51.379> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.410> pull<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.800> off<00:00:52.980> or<00:00:53.219> leave<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> on

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
top you can pull this off or leave it on

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.709 
top you can pull this off or leave it on
doesn't<00:00:53.940> matter<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> take<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.629> off

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
doesn't matter I like to take it off

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.410 
doesn't matter I like to take it off
makes<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.230> easier<00:00:55.820> flip<00:00:56.820> his<00:00:56.940> arms<00:00:57.239> up

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
makes a little easier flip his arms up

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.590 
makes a little easier flip his arms up
like<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.890> flip<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.210> red<00:01:00.359> pieces

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
like so flip these little red pieces

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.750 
like so flip these little red pieces
down<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:02.270> then<00:01:03.270> pop<00:01:03.930> his<00:01:04.110> legs<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.610> put<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

down and then pop his legs out put this
feet<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.000> flaps<00:01:09.270> fold<00:01:09.570> up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
feet up and these little flaps fold up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
feet up and these little flaps fold up
and<00:01:10.110> around<00:01:10.640> on<00:01:11.640> both<00:01:11.909> sides<00:01:13.580> cover<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and around on both sides cover the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
and around on both sides cover the
wheels<00:01:14.900> what<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.380> usually<00:01:16.500> right<00:01:16.830> here

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
wheels what I do is I usually right here

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.410 
wheels what I do is I usually right here
there's<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> little<00:01:17.460> divot<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.970> used<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.330> my

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420

thumb<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.280> that's<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
thumb right in there that's how I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.710 
thumb right in there that's how I
thought<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:21.799> flip<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.479> front

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
thought then flip this up and this front

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
thought then flip this up and this front
piece<00:01:24.900> folds<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.490> there's<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
piece folds down you can see there's a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.149 
piece folds down you can see there's a
little<00:01:26.909> tab<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.860> slot

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
little tab right there and a little slot

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
little tab right there and a little slot
right<00:01:29.189> there<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> flip<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
right there and you just kind of flip it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.380 
right there and you just kind of flip it
around<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> tab<00:01:32.490> plugs<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:33.119> into

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
around so that tab plugs right into

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170 
around so that tab plugs right into
there<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.130> locks<00:01:35.369> his<00:01:35.579> waste<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.970> place

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
there and that locks his waste in place

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.219 
there and that locks his waste in place
you<00:01:36.360> flip<00:01:36.570> his<00:01:36.689> legs<00:01:36.900> around<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you flip his legs around and then you

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.230 
you flip his legs around and then you
take<00:01:40.380> his<00:01:40.500> arms<00:01:41.420> pull<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:44.030> flip<00:01:45.030> them

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
take his arms pull them down flip them

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.080 
take his arms pull them down flip them
around<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.750> put<00:01:46.079> your<00:01:46.200> neck<00:01:46.470> up

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.570 

he's<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.930> wrong<00:01:50.110> way<00:01:50.260> he<00:01:50.380> should<00:01:50.440> be<00:01:50.770> facing

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
he's the wrong way he should be facing

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.570 
he's the wrong way he should be facing
backwards<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.979> for<00:01:54.520> the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
backwards and then for the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.910

transformation his left fist slides up
from<00:01:59.920> where<00:02:00.100> was<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.500> have

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
from where was and there you have

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.040 
from where was and there you have
optimists<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:04.960> plug<00:02:05.259> his<00:02:06.690> shield<00:02:07.690> into
