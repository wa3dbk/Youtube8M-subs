bit of tarkir watercolor style drawing

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:06.429 
bit of tarkir watercolor style drawing
in<00:00:57.650> design<00:00:59.590> and<00:01:01.810> that's<00:01:02.810> it<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:05.439> that's

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
in design and that's it and that's

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.459 
in design and that's it and that's
enough<00:01:06.799> for<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.250> box<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.299> it's<00:01:08.929> a<00:01:09.049> small<00:01:09.289> box

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
enough for the box so it's a small box

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.719 
enough for the box so it's a small box
nothing<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:10.100> talk<00:01:10.250> about

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
nothing to talk about

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.410 
nothing to talk about
so<00:01:11.179> let's<00:01:11.719> take<00:01:12.229> her<00:01:12.439> out<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.369> show<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.060> what

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
so let's take her out and show you what

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:24.700 
so let's take her out and show you what
it<00:01:14.479> is<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:20.649> here<00:01:21.649> we<00:01:21.740> oh<00:01:21.920> wait<00:01:22.789> a<00:01:22.850> minute<00:01:23.710> there

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
it is and here we oh wait a minute there

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.810 
it is and here we oh wait a minute there
is<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.130> bit<00:01:25.429> odd<00:01:26.049> so<00:01:27.049> where<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.740> figure<00:01:28.039> well

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
is a bit odd so where is the figure well

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.099 
is a bit odd so where is the figure well
that's<00:01:29.539> the<00:01:29.689> thing

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
that's the thing

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.819 
that's the thing
this<00:01:30.439> is<00:01:30.679> a<00:01:30.890> e^x<00:01:31.460> figure<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.659> exit<00:01:33.170> never<00:01:33.560> come

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
this is a e^x figure the exit never come

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.959 
this is a e^x figure the exit never come
with<00:01:34.069> any<00:01:34.600> base<00:01:35.600> figure<00:01:35.899> at<00:01:36.109> all<00:01:36.759> what<00:01:37.759> you

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
with any base figure at all what you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.130 
with any base figure at all what you
need<00:01:38.229> when<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.319> add<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:39.590> buy<00:01:39.859> eggs<00:01:40.280> set<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.840> one

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
need when you add to buy eggs set is one

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.029 
need when you add to buy eggs set is one
of<00:01:42.229> these<00:01:42.439> a<00:01:42.729> MMS<00:01:43.729> naked<00:01:44.270> as<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:45.319> a<00:01:45.530> bear<00:01:45.770> body

on its basic go onto here like this and
hope<00:03:53.950> upside<00:03:54.790> down<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:56.200> way<00:03:56.640> just<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:57.760> that

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.830 

and<00:04:00.970> now<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.300> funny<00:04:01.960> colour<00:04:02.170> cat<00:04:02.860> Mouse<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.840> she
