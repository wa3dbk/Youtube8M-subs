will I think especially after this

really<00:01:44.399> make<00:01:44.700> sense<00:01:45.170> either<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.130> mean

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
really make sense either way like I mean

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.649 
really make sense either way like I mean
even<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.579> she<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.060> better<00:01:48.149> she<00:01:48.479> wouldn't

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
even if she did get better she wouldn't

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.480 
even if she did get better she wouldn't
really<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:49.110> able<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.189> way<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
really be able to go all the way to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
really be able to go all the way to
where<00:01:50.790> gray<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.630> only<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.049> she'll

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
where gray is the only way that she'll

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.170 
where gray is the only way that she'll
get<00:01:52.590> involved<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.220> whole<00:01:53.369> gray<00:01:53.700> thing<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
get involved in this whole gray thing is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.569 
get involved in this whole gray thing is
if<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.290> whole<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.070> settled<00:01:56.460> at

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
if this whole thing is not settled at

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
if this whole thing is not settled at
avatar<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:59.850> lot<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.600> people<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
avatar and I think a lot of people I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
avatar and I think a lot of people I
think<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.040> avatar<00:02:02.219> thing<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.030> be

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
think the avatar thing is going to be

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
think the avatar thing is going to be
settled<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.869> might<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> very

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
settled I think there might be a very

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.929 
settled I think there might be a very
good<00:02:04.560> chance<00:02:04.740> though<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.130> gray<00:02:05.340> getting<00:02:05.670> away

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
good chance though of gray getting away

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.300 
good chance though of gray getting away
at<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> end<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.750> arc<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.259> us<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.740> saving

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
at the end of this arc and us not saving

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.639 
at the end of this arc and us not saving
him<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.550> fact<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.140> people<00:02:10.440> have

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
him in fact because a lot of people have

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.860 
him in fact because a lot of people have
pointed<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.520> not<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.000> avatar<00:02:12.540> arc

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
pointed out this is not the avatar arc

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.580 
pointed out this is not the avatar arc
although<00:02:13.379> it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
although it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.900 
although it
so<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.739> looks<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.250> turning<00:02:14.459> into<00:02:14.670> it

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so it looks like it's turning into it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.670 
so it looks like it's turning into it
this<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.690> brain<00:02:15.930> theory<00:02:16.170> tale<00:02:16.440> back

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
this is the brain theory tale back

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.670 
this is the brain theory tale back
together<00:02:16.920> arc<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.810> don't<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.230> how<00:02:19.440> much

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
together arc so I don't know how much

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.290 
together arc so I don't know how much
longer<00:02:19.980> we're<00:02:20.190> gonna<00:02:20.250> put<00:02:20.489> our<00:02:20.580> focus<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.120> this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
longer we're gonna put our focus on this

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.740 
longer we're gonna put our focus on this
guilt<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:22.080> as<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.879> those<00:02:23.879> one<00:02:24.120> shots<00:02:24.420> from

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
guilt but as we see those one shots from

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.350 
guilt but as we see those one shots from
last<00:02:24.959> chapter<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.500> drove<00:02:25.739> me<00:02:25.890> insane<00:02:26.360> they

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
last chapter that drove me insane they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.259 
last chapter that drove me insane they
weren't<00:02:27.629> exactly<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:28.440> shots<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.760> don't

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
weren't exactly one shots so I don't

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.059 
weren't exactly one shots so I don't
know<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.720> much<00:02:30.930> more<00:02:31.110> time<00:02:31.319> we<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.530> spend<00:02:31.860> on

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
know how much more time we can spend on

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.800 
know how much more time we can spend on
like<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.730> actually<00:02:32.879> turn<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.360> into<00:02:33.599> an

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
like and actually turn this into an

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.869 
like and actually turn this into an
avatar<00:02:34.080> arc<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.650> these<00:02:34.950> guys<00:02:35.129> are<00:02:35.430> good<00:02:35.670> enough

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.850 
can admit that you saw the Twilight
movies<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.569> reminded<00:03:10.079> me<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.230> lot<00:03:10.379> of<00:03:10.440> Jane's

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
movies it reminded me a lot of Jane's

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.069 
movies it reminded me a lot of Jane's
power<00:03:11.250> if<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:11.970> even<00:03:12.180> remember<00:03:12.360> who<00:03:12.750> she<00:03:12.959> is

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
power if you even remember who she is

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.619 
power if you even remember who she is
she's<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.709> chick<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.099> think<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.239> might<00:03:15.569> be

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
she's the chick I think that it might be

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.539 
she's the chick I think that it might be
similar<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.110> hers<00:03:16.379> and<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:17.099> not

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
similar to hers and that it's not

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.180 
similar to hers and that it's not
actually<00:03:18.209> causing<00:03:18.450> pain<00:03:18.900> she<00:03:19.680> attacks<00:03:19.980> your

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
actually causing pain she attacks your

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.830 
actually causing pain she attacks your
mind<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.760> makes<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.120> think<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.810> are

oh but seriously it looks like it's

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.869 
oh but seriously it looks like it's
gotten<00:04:36.779> harder<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.439> we<00:04:38.159> might<00:04:38.340> even<00:04:38.550> be<00:04:38.699> able

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
the purification project and gray could

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.739 
the purification project and gray could
get<00:04:43.889> away<00:04:44.009> in<00:04:44.279> the<00:04:44.370> end<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.729> us<00:04:45.210> just<00:04:45.270> not

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
change his mind I think the biggest

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.510

trouble<00:04:48.150> with<00:04:48.689> grey<00:04:48.900> at<00:04:48.960> this<00:04:49.110> point<00:04:49.349> is<00:04:49.560> if<00:04:49.860> he

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
trouble with grey at this point is if he

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.899 
trouble with grey at this point is if he
was<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:51.090> get<00:04:51.749> his<00:04:51.990> shot<00:04:52.259> at<00:04:52.379> revenge<00:04:52.909> and

was to get his shot at revenge and

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.689 
was to get his shot at revenge and
learned<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.659> Natsu<00:04:55.259> was<00:04:55.439> end<00:04:55.740> in<00:04:55.979> this<00:04:56.370> state

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
learned that Natsu was end in this state

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.700 
learned that Natsu was end in this state
it<00:04:57.029> could<00:04:57.210> be<00:04:57.389> very<00:04:57.719> very<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.259> could<00:04:58.409> be<00:04:58.499> a<00:04:58.529> very

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
it could be very very it could be a very

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.409 
it could be very very it could be a very
bad<00:04:58.949> fight<00:04:59.249> and<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.580> don't<00:04:59.639> see<00:05:00.060> how<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.389> would

learns<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.199> Natsu<00:05:10.529> is<00:05:10.620> end<00:05:10.860> in<00:05:11.009> this<00:05:11.159> state

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
learns that Natsu is end in this state

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.040 
learns that Natsu is end in this state
although<00:05:11.939> I<00:05:11.969> think<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.419> really<00:05:12.659> good<00:05:12.779> shot

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
although I think it's a really good shot

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.309 
although I think it's a really good shot
of<00:05:13.080> happening<00:05:13.789> but<00:05:14.930> yeah<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.139> looks<00:05:16.289> like

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
of happening but yeah it looks like

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.300 
of happening but yeah it looks like
we're<00:05:16.469> gonna<00:05:16.560> see<00:05:16.770> gajeel<00:05:17.099> enter<00:05:17.819> soon<00:05:18.090> and

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
we're gonna see gajeel enter soon and

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.670 
we're gonna see gajeel enter soon and
looks<00:05:20.310> like<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.849> guild<00:05:21.479> isn't<00:05:21.839> quite<00:05:22.319> as<00:05:22.439> bad

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
looks like the guild isn't quite as bad

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.309 
looks like the guild isn't quite as bad
as<00:05:22.710> we<00:05:23.039> thought<00:05:23.430> they<00:05:23.490> were<00:05:24.150> I<00:05:24.839> mean<00:05:24.900> they

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
as we thought they were I mean they

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.920 
as we thought they were I mean they
still<00:05:25.589> got<00:05:25.830> one<00:05:26.069> shotted<00:05:26.520> but<00:05:26.879> they<00:05:27.419> recovered

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
still got one shotted but they recovered

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.399 
still got one shotted but they recovered
fast<00:05:28.490> they<00:05:29.490> recovered<00:05:29.879> quickly<00:05:30.089> so<00:05:30.810> we'll

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
fast they recovered quickly so we'll

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.740 
fast they recovered quickly so we'll
just<00:05:31.650> have<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.009> see<00:05:32.189> yeah<00:05:32.629> originally<00:05:33.629> I'd

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
just have to see yeah originally I'd

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.110 
just have to see yeah originally I'd
wanted<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.289> like<00:05:35.039> even<00:05:35.250> numbers<00:05:35.819> fight

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
wanted that like even numbers fight

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.119 
wanted that like even numbers fight
rather<00:05:36.750> than<00:05:36.960> like<00:05:37.080> Natsu<00:05:37.500> taking<00:05:37.800> on<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:37.979> whole

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
rather than like Natsu taking on a whole

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.820 
rather than like Natsu taking on a whole
bunch<00:05:38.370> of<00:05:38.460> people<00:05:39.229> but<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.319> only<00:05:40.469> way<00:05:40.589> I<00:05:40.650> saw

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
bunch of people but the only way I saw

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.209 
bunch of people but the only way I saw
that<00:05:41.009> coming<00:05:41.370> in<00:05:41.610> was<00:05:42.000> if<00:05:42.360> we<00:05:42.810> had<00:05:42.839> like<00:05:43.229> Wendy

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
that coming in was if we had like Wendy

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.260 
that coming in was if we had like Wendy
and<00:05:44.339> Juvia<00:05:44.669> and<00:05:44.789> I<00:05:44.819> don't<00:05:44.909> think<00:05:45.060> that's

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
and Juvia and I don't think that's

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.290 
and Juvia and I don't think that's
coming<00:05:45.539> at<00:05:45.629> this<00:05:45.750> point<00:05:46.020> so<00:05:46.439> either<00:05:46.740> way<00:05:47.009> uh<00:05:47.460> I
