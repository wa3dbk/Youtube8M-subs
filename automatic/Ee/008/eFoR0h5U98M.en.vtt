00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.980
 the predictions they have for ur 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.740
 sleman and 32 on that list obviously not 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.020
 could steam miss versus undertaker in 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.420
 the description will leave you the link on 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.180
 champion of nx of kevin owens was 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.550
 interviewed here the highlights of the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.120
 interview of this heavy fighter about 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.520
 the ww being in this company is a dream 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.309
 come true my parents know that 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560
 since I was 11 years old this was my dream and 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.690
 I managed to make it come true another of the 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.880
 dreams come true is to converse with 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.010
 shawn michaels he is one of the reasons 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.260
 why I'm here when I saw it 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 fight on lehman websites since 11 was when 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.730
 I decided that I wanted to be a fighter 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.860
 tell him in person I could speak half 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.040
 hour with him on a stream on his 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.350
 injury my knee goes well I'm going ahead 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.619
 to the deadlines set in a couple of 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.330
 I'll be 100% week is great because 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.610
 Since I arrived, I have not been able to fight 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.310
 100% was an injury that had me 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.680
 bothered since my debut when I get back 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.240
 I will be better than ever another novel that 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280
 apparently it was closed 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.770
 but that's so very informative 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.110
 q interesting as told in no 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.630
 moment he spoke with vince mcmahon but that 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.790
 he always spoke with triple h this was what 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.979
 who said triple h is who is in charge 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.950
 I discovered it when I got in touch 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.320
 with vince I've always had a good 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.659
 relationship with triple h so I was 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.659
 somewhat confident but apparently I 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.880
 I made a mistake because he canceled our meeting 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.710
 I never had the opportunity to see them or 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.130
 they even sat down and talked with me 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.319
 when I found out that wwf was not 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.899
 interested in my return I was shocked 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.840
 it was as if I were a me seeing as álex 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.479
 tyler dna approached me they gave me everything 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.530
 I wanted the dates the money and time 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.690
 free 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.990
 from that moment I said I will not insist 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.970
 to triple h nor to vince anymore when 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.310
 you get to this you have to continue with the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.170
 people who want to take care of you one of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.390
 my dreamed fights if I had returned 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.880
 it would have been kurt anglais versus 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.769
 daniel bryan good at least understood that 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.920
 can not betray the company that 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.900
 gave the recognition first with ww 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.090
 then you wanted to go tn 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.730
 to make more money let's see if at 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.890
 final cut is true or not true 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.019
 is that I do not think kurt annul is left 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.569
 in the company yes vince just for fuck 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.540
 offers you a contract I was happy 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.970
 with the idea of ​​seeing kurt and le in ww 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.620
 but tn has helped a lot I am 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.989
 aware that the company also 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.299
 it comes out winning but it would be unfair 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.670
 let's go good guys we start with 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.890
 another elimination on this occasion will be in 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.870
 Spanish so comment in the box 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.120
 comments the name of the event, 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.639
 wrestlers and the recommended year put 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.829
 from 2005 onwards it may be that 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.750
 find some older ones but if you 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.940
 comment has several little hands 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.459
 up and does not appear in the deletion anymore 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.109
 you know what the reason is finally I want 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.629
 thank those nine thousand people 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.670
 subscribed to the channel we are close to 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.370
 add one more digit to the numbers of 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.930
 subscribers I do not know what rays to do for 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.299
