00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.410
 player I can get the two influence 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 picks of these i really thought there was 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 5 value are the name it is better that 10 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 are more likely to be good players 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.989
 second 83 reason player 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.969

 re pack number three column clover 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 it is not four leaf clover so it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.670
 actually does not succeed 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.710
 fucking bullshit and we get ruffles 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.989
 that cheeky how the fuck is a gay 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.270
 skin spray fascinates may be one bag but this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.220
 is really quite sthe number 4 pack 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.710
 well and chicken menus and it looked pretty 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.010
 number 5 the tender is already on the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.950
 half and we don't get one at all 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.930
 bag of ammonia grim one more time 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 reasonable games i have had none for so long 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.770
 good players had more look open 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.540
 do have gun you for that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.829
 do not always think split-second per model 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.619
 you that always very life is short here 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.770

 another us well and scrip 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.460
 again nothing at all no, incredible 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.710
 this 15 or capex really just started with 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.899
 joe hart it started reasonably but now now 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.710
 they are really just dramatically like it 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.179
 hell 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.929
 one the last pack I'm curious 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.459
 another fucking who the more you like this 77 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.610
 drove the idea this is really just 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.430
 you already after the very last 25th pack 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.260
 j oh my fucking tim curl in google for 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.330
 the second time just from the bullshit 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.700
 really incredible this where we go or 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.230
 open the seventh or carfax for this 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.200
 was really dramatic, you can apparently 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.660
 so there are still 15d effects that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.459
 about which you place a 7 0 k effect from 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.110
 here now counts more than many you know 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.599
 never believe yes 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.140
 never and the so green player bleed 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.170
 play 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.849
 it excites him beyond pocket so you can get them at 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.160
 the this card where I have this training 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.430
 the effect you are here by chance and now 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.660
 pack just come light up okay yes enter 90 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.690
 he was still in my pocket 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.430
 really for 20 it can be had in idea asia 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.319
 moment people may buy this for eight 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.849
 point where you are eight point 6 but you can 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.859
 this car the for 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.019
 9k I don't think I want to change 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.239
 you can sell 9 tickets so why 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.700
 she was he despised can sale sandisk 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.769
 eye-fi no well second 15 times a Sunday 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.359
 I'm pretty nice playing the same green 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.540
 nor do they deliver much more 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.370
 but this was really just typing CJ 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.650
 pack that just doesn't make sense well we 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.389
 go have a look see 3 pack 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.090
 open then it has been nice he has 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.519
 not quÃ©bec and cheese by an online john 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.590
 those four so quiet so maybe me whole 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.660
 nice to use what we want at 4k 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.459
 not really hook with the portuguese lieke 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.530
 but my brother might come on 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.600
 path well but something valuable 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.760
 impractical not valuable that is real 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.980
 just play a shit shit shit post on 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.140
 could see sea ice that penny but lives in it 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.240
 can make 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.700
 an extra places over a little trees 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.060
 animals green hoppakee the green is many 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.280
 group either way I didn't have one 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 better but it's nice green cards 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.360
 yes, he wants that one last pack 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.010
 and we had chicken again and this time 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.870
 no green play names remember it 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.700
 not sure and because then you can always end 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.380
 something special down slightly in March and 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.850
 willems that is your less one 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.459
 fall in love pack but from rest 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.350
 ok the last 15 pp I'm wondering if 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.430
 there still at least 580 ever the plus 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.709
 play 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.750
 no it's not about you 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.100
 best for tendon but shooting is surprise 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.150
 you could do it four skills and 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.370
 Left behind 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.220
 american 80p for the rest was according to 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.130
 me travel you shit also a 7 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.350
 capek and then the feedback and skip 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.120
 and that was pretty bullshit a thousand 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.100
 cage in which feedback also just go 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.210
 just opening and then this pack opening 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.160
 I'm curious 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.840
 that one rare play it would be one 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.430
 but how crazy would you be 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.320
 I am curious I think it will be 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.610
 free shet and we get lucas 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.070
 how that is still quite it is 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.930
 actually 380 does not know the best cut 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.940
 best players have already known on e83 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.560
 lucas games was certainly not wrong 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.669
 but guys this was the episode like 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.530
