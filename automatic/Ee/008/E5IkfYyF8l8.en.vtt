00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.140
 the eur 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 yes there was the elder but it ended but 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.590
 when we arrive at the last minute sea that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 what we are walking is a fault of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.410
 his late nights 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430

 mandolin and Chinese make photos then 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:17.229
 other clichés but stop it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.200

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.070

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.640
 of a woman believing towards the counter 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:36.819

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.970
 undertaken before it will bring ours 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:44.060

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.060

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.890
