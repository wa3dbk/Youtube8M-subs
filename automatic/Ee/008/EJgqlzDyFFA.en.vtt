the espa deck is pretty weak at the
early<00:00:38.190> game<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:39.420> strong<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
early game it's really strong in the

early game it's really strong in the
layer<00:00:40.440> mid<00:00:40.950> game<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.640> carries<00:00:42.120> over<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
layer mid game and it carries over to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.920 
layer mid game and it carries over to
late<00:00:42.809> game<00:00:43.050> basically<00:00:44.239> but<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.390> deck<00:00:45.660> has

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
late game basically but this deck has

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
late game basically but this deck has

the main to help help the deck reach mid
game<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:57.090> hopefully<00:00:58.070> something<00:00:59.070> like

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
game where hopefully something like

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.180 
game where hopefully something like
ender<00:01:00.059> still<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.420> ease<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:01.140> Elspeth<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.949> just

ender still at ease into Elspeth is just

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.810 
ender still at ease into Elspeth is just
game<00:01:02.550> breaking<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.439> tech<00:01:04.650> runs<00:01:04.890> 25<00:01:05.400> lands

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

as<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.070> probably<00:01:20.939> knows<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:23.090> have<00:01:24.090> not

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
as you probably knows but I have not

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.350 
as you probably knows but I have not

tried more than this to get because I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
tried more than this to get because I
don't<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.869> deck<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.890> much

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759

need them a singleton steam or gray or
only<00:02:13.430> for<00:02:13.640> drop<00:02:14.800> basically<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.580> how<00:02:16.880> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
only for drop basically this is how the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.460 
only for drop basically this is how the
decks<00:02:17.290> used<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.470> look<00:02:20.019> something<00:02:21.019> like<00:02:21.290> this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
decks used to look something like this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.210 
decks used to look something like this
maybe<00:02:22.120> something<00:02:23.120> else<00:02:23.239> down<00:02:23.630> here<00:02:23.830> but<00:02:24.830> now

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
maybe something else down here but now

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.030 
maybe something else down here but now
when<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.730> sweepers<00:02:26.540> cost<00:02:26.900> five<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.920> how

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
when the sweepers cost five this is how

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.410 
when the sweepers cost five this is how
it<00:02:28.190> will<00:02:28.280> look<00:02:28.420> steam<00:02:29.420> augury<00:02:30.019> gives<00:02:30.530> you

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
it will look steam augury gives you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.620 
it will look steam augury gives you
basically<00:02:32.420> two<00:02:32.690> cards<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:34.519> second<00:02:35.090> best<00:02:35.239> card

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
basically two cards the second best card

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.520 
basically two cards the second best card
and<00:02:36.430> Al<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.900> usually<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.760> Mills<00:02:41.360> three<00:02:41.900> which

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
and Al and usually and Mills three which

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.830 
and Al and usually and Mills three which
powers<00:02:43.010> up<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.430> day<00:02:43.549> through<00:02:43.819> time<00:02:44.030> basically

and then we have the full four and still

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.850 
and then we have the full four and still
it<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.930> pretty<00:02:51.170> good<00:02:51.410> at<00:02:51.590> sweeping

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
it is so it's pretty good at sweeping

time<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.269> code<00:02:56.510> rules<00:02:56.750> then<00:02:57.019> we<00:02:57.110> have<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.500> sarkan

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
time is code rules then we have a sarkan

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.120 
time is code rules then we have a sarkan
