really doubt it but I've been fooled

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.680 
really doubt it but I've been fooled
before<00:00:46.219> first<00:00:47.219> thing<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.059> pump

strength

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.819 

just<00:01:30.540> blurt<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.840> out

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829

you talk about a miracle this thing

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.179 
you talk about a miracle this thing
started<00:01:49.399> by<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.670> cranky<00:01:50.270> she<00:01:50.600> started<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.470> got

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
started by a cranky she started I got

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.249 
started by a cranky she started I got
the<00:01:52.310> sweet<00:01:52.549> spot<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.090> she<00:01:53.270> fired<00:01:53.569> up<00:01:53.840> don't

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
the sweet spot and she fired up don't

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.510 
the sweet spot and she fired up don't
ask<00:01:54.500> me<00:01:54.740> how<00:01:55.569> she's<00:01:56.569> are<00:01:56.750> running<00:01:57.520> supplies

glue<00:01:59.060> blasted<00:01:59.630> miracle<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.289> she's<00:02:00.439> around

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
glue blasted miracle but she's around

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.580 
glue blasted miracle but she's around
so<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.330> guess<00:02:02.600> well<00:02:02.780> they<00:02:02.870> didn't<00:02:03.080> warm<00:02:03.260> up<00:02:03.440> in

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
so I guess well they didn't warm up in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.010 
so I guess well they didn't warm up in
case<00:02:03.740> we<00:02:03.950> need<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.390> this<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.600> truck<00:02:05.840> I'd

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
case we need it this is a truck I'd

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.720 
case we need it this is a truck I'd
rather<00:02:06.200> drive<00:02:06.530> if<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.980> had<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.190> get<00:02:07.310> out<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.640> do

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
rather drive if I had to get out to do

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.400 
rather drive if I had to get out to do

pull somebody out the ditch or something

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.670 
pull somebody out the ditch or something
I'd<00:02:11.210> rather<00:02:11.360> drive<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.930> instead<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.470> driving

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
I'd rather drive this instead of driving

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.370 
I'd rather drive this instead of driving
something<00:02:13.210> newer<00:02:14.210> or<00:02:14.630> something<00:02:14.960> like<00:02:15.050> mater

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
something newer or something like mater

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.310 
something newer or something like mater
just<00:02:15.950> something<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.510> honestly<00:02:17.510> tore<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.200> up

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
just something that honestly tore it up

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.500 
just something that honestly tore it up
it<00:02:18.500> would<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.800> really<00:02:19.610> really<00:02:19.760> hard<00:02:20.210> broke

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
it would be really really hard broke

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.230 
it would be really really hard broke
over<00:02:21.010> let's<00:02:22.010> let<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.310> warm<00:02:22.640> up<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.030> we'll<00:02:23.120> go

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
over let's let this warm up and we'll go

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.350 
over let's let this warm up and we'll go
code<00:02:23.570> search<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.350> forward<00:02:24.760> it's<00:02:25.760> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
code search it's the forward it's the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.390 
code search it's the forward it's the
other<00:02:26.480> port<00:02:26.780> blue<00:02:27.050> one<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.040> know<00:02:28.100> it'll

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
other port blue one but I know it'll

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.220 
other port blue one but I know it'll
start<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:29.000> it'll<00:02:29.270> start<00:02:29.510> easy<00:02:29.720> because<00:02:30.020> it's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
start but it'll start easy because it's

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.460 
start but it'll start easy because it's
plugged<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.090> mean<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:32.960> just<00:02:33.080> really

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
plugged in so I mean it's just really

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.910 
plugged in so I mean it's just really
cold<00:02:33.770> there
