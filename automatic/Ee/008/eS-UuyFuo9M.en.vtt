00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello welcome scully fans yes 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 It is so far the next scandal 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.200
 seems has arrived and indeed the hot 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.139
 heat 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:21.930
 That's the packaging looks right 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:27.720
 not big brother of raptor 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.279
 I'm curious how long it will be 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.870
 are take to the cottage sold out 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.870
 and will be sold out here 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.559
 there comes the 1 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.070
 then probably next year 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.850
 Although to know already know 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.420
 Comeback probably only in the new 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.070
 We already know about building 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.070
 us is actually not bad going 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.140
 that is mostly always for endfights 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 because always nice rockets from above 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:10.770
 can throw 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:13.220
 But back to the hot heat is on fire times 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.220
 brought out 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 Of course, as always well packaged 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.679
 because no case damage 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:01.860
 yes, so you can really nice 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 rausholen 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:34.239
 there is a new york seems matching card 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:36.780
 this was accompanied by a guide for the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.780
 computer 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.080
 and that's why everyone wants it 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:54.050
 have 150 in the madness 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.020
 then I have to give you a short break afterwards 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.480
 the BE REDUCED portal 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.770
 I hope that then also shines 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.770
 if I put the same time on the portal 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.000
 120 quickness 60 ok lucky 80s is 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.000
 fast and has a strong attack 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 hot 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.940
 that's her or him 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.420
 So put it right on it 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.690
 Now I will shine once 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.690
 drauflegen 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:58.689
 so now I will shine once 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:04:03.549
 put the profit of the lights up 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:08.340
 A controller vibrates on the head 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:10.290
 is already put on it again 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.950
 not bad 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.950
 I hope it will be fine 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.729
 so directly from my monitor 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.370
 so 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.350
 So I hope you liked it 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.350
 buy the start 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.110
 Here is hot heat in action 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:58.350
 I saw the boxing earlier 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.350
 150 strength or damage can do that 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:10.530
 really fight all change 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.060
 and then I'm on level four 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:25.660
 played up just a few inches 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.660
 played flamethrower 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.720
 stromboli 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.850
 so my real fight scene is like 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.450
 quickly I flatten you now and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.450
 again step up 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.400
 so I am looking forward to the coming 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.260
 game scenes 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.260
 So thumbs up
