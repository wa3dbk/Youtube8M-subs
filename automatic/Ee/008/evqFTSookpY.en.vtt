00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
think it's a lot of fun even though in

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.860 
think it's a lot of fun even though in
the<00:05:00.229> real-life<00:05:00.440> situation<00:05:01.219> at<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.610> altitude

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
the real-life situation at that altitude

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.689 
the real-life situation at that altitude
the<00:05:02.870> snakes<00:05:03.199> will<00:05:03.349> eventually<00:05:03.800> either<00:05:03.979> die<00:05:04.370> or

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
the snakes will eventually either die or

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.450 
the snakes will eventually either die or
be<00:05:05.360> in<00:05:05.449> a<00:05:05.569> comatose<00:05:05.960> state<00:05:06.379> throughout<00:05:07.190> that

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
be in a comatose state throughout that

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.180 
be in a comatose state throughout that
whole<00:05:07.520> flight<00:05:08.090> because<00:05:08.740> Coppola<00:05:09.740> creatures

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
whole flight because Coppola creatures

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.860 
whole flight because Coppola creatures
like<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.400> when<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:10.879> survived<00:05:11.270> high

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
like that when that survived high

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.260 
like that when that survived high
altitudes<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.039> that<00:05:13.310> wouldn't<00:05:13.639> make

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
altitudes like that that wouldn't make

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.830 
altitudes like that that wouldn't make
sense<00:05:14.469> but<00:05:15.469> again<00:05:15.770> it's<00:05:15.949> a<00:05:16.039> movie<00:05:16.460> it's<00:05:17.360> it's
