00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
can kind of control my body first have

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.250 
can kind of control my body first have
to<00:02:10.369> be<00:02:10.580> afraid<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.269> I<00:02:11.750> have<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.989> be<00:02:12.110> like

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
to be afraid of and I have to be like

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.410 
to be afraid of and I have to be like
completely<00:02:12.560> terrorized<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.970> then<00:02:14.390> I

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
completely terrorized and and then I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.120 
completely terrorized and and then I
know<00:02:14.540> I'm<00:02:14.780> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.079> have<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.410> do<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.799> mean

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
know I'm going to have to do it I mean

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.250 
know I'm going to have to do it I mean
nobody<00:02:16.190> ever<00:02:16.700> been<00:02:16.940> change<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.510> doing<00:02:17.840> things

it's<00:02:44.510> very<00:02:44.750> fascinating<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.590> me<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.010> I'm

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
it's very fascinating to me and I'm

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.390 
it's very fascinating to me and I'm
drawn<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.470> has<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.340> know

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
drawn to that in it has you know

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.640 
drawn to that in it has you know
vitality<00:02:50.060> because<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.049> also<00:02:51.079> told

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
vitality because of that you also told

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.110 
vitality because of that you also told
me<00:02:51.859> that<00:02:52.220> when<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:53.000> are<00:02:53.410> performing<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.910> can

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
me that when you are performing you can

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.759 
me that when you are performing you can
do<00:02:56.329> things<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:57.680> normally<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.880> can't<00:02:59.810> do<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
do things that normally you can't do the

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.500 
do things that normally you can't do the
moment<00:03:01.190> when<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.459> really<00:03:01.820> get<00:03:02.120> into<00:03:02.180> that

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
moment when you really get into that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.539 
moment when you really get into that
kind<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.019> performative<00:03:03.560> space<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:04.400> are

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
kind of performative space you are

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.030 
kind of performative space you are
leaving<00:03:04.970> your<00:03:05.390> low<00:03:06.019> self<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.709> you're

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
leaving your low self and you're

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.030 
leaving your low self and you're
transforming<00:03:07.760> into<00:03:08.090> your<00:03:08.319> higher<00:03:09.319> self<00:03:09.350> I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
transforming into your higher self I

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.640 
transforming into your higher self I
just<00:03:10.549> can<00:03:10.700> say<00:03:10.880> higher<00:03:11.150> self<00:03:11.540> some<00:03:11.959> kind<00:03:12.530> of

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
just can say higher self some kind of

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.620 
just can say higher self some kind of
strange<00:03:13.040> things<00:03:13.370> take<00:03:13.700> place<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.329> this

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
strange things take place and this

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.840 
strange things take place and this
higher<00:03:14.930> self<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.100> all<00:03:16.280> energy<00:03:16.699> or

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
higher self is the is the all energy or

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.939 
higher self is the is the all energy or
have<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.180> put<00:03:17.389> into<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.079> then<00:03:18.560> when<00:03:18.799> the

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
have you put into that and then when the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.350 
have you put into that and then when the
really<00:03:19.130> thing<00:03:19.400> happened<00:03:19.820> we

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
really thing happened we

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.540 
really thing happened we
every<00:03:20.800> circumstances<00:03:21.800> are<00:03:22.010> there<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.430> have

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
every circumstances are there you have

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.430 
every circumstances are there you have
to<00:03:22.670> accept<00:03:22.940> them<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.300> they<00:03:23.510> let<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.810> go<00:03:23.960> and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
to accept them and they let it go and

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.290 
to accept them and they let it go and
not<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.950> idea<00:03:25.430> plays<00:03:25.730> into<00:03:26.000> all<00:03:26.030> your

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
not that idea plays into all your

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.490 
not that idea plays into all your
performance<00:03:26.810> why<00:03:27.200> because<00:03:27.680> there<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.490> a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
performance why because there is a

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.050 
performance why because there is a
certain<00:03:30.500> amount<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.680> uncertainty<00:03:31.060> yeah

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
certain amount of uncertainty yeah

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.670 
certain amount of uncertainty yeah
because<00:03:32.270> everything<00:03:32.900> would<00:03:33.110> happen<00:03:33.530> in<00:03:33.650> that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
because everything would happen in that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.650 
because everything would happen in that
period<00:03:34.250> can<00:03:34.790> be<00:03:34.820> earthquake<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:35.570> with

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
period can be earthquake and with

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.580 
period can be earthquake and with
electricity<00:03:36.020> stop

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
electricity stop

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.960 
electricity stop
everything's<00:03:37.010> part<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.490> piece<00:03:37.670> because

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
everything's part of the piece because

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.490 
everything's part of the piece because
you<00:03:38.090> can't<00:03:38.330> predict<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.840> oh<00:03:38.930> wait<00:03:39.110> wait<00:03:39.320> wait

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
you can't predict it oh wait wait wait

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.350 
you can't predict it oh wait wait wait
that<00:03:39.680> now<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.610> now<00:03:40.700> you're<00:03:40.850> going<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.090> do<00:03:41.210> your

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
that now so now you're going to do your

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.800 
that now so now you're going to do your
goal

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
goal

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.620 
goal
put<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.200> ball<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.710> middle<00:03:43.240> okay<00:03:44.240> and<00:03:44.450> then

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
put the ball in the middle okay and then

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.620 
put the ball in the middle okay and then
rub<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.080> gold<00:03:45.290> around<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:46.520> ball<00:03:46.700> look<00:03:47.480> at

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
rub the gold around the ball look at

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.920 
rub the gold around the ball look at
that<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.830> now<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.250> want<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.880> eat<00:03:49.910> I<00:03:50.300> close

that and now I want you to eat I close

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.990 
that and now I want you to eat I close
your<00:03:51.080> eyes<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.530> think<00:03:52.280> it's<00:03:52.400> very<00:03:52.520> important

those eyes because it's really then you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.040 
those eyes because it's really then you
are<00:03:54.620> there<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.100> then<00:03:56.090> eat<00:03:56.300> it<00:03:56.330> slowly<00:03:56.750> and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
are there and then eat it slowly and
