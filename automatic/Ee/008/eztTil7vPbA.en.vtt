or something you will see that it has

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.580 
or something you will see that it has
like<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:43.980> orange<00:03:44.640> undertone<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:46.230> that

there<00:03:50.190> will<00:03:50.519> help<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:51.470> cancel<00:03:52.470> out<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> lot<00:03:53.010> of

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
there will help to cancel out a lot of

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.300 
there will help to cancel out a lot of
that<00:03:53.310> darkness<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.420> normally<00:03:55.170> there<00:03:55.410> but

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
that darkness that is normally there but

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.660 
that darkness that is normally there but
you<00:03:56.519> can<00:03:56.670> see<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:57.810> basically<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.890> gone

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
you can see that just basically is gone

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.820 
you can see that just basically is gone
just<00:04:00.090> by<00:04:00.299> using<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.290> I'm<00:04:01.380> gonna<00:04:01.590> show

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
just by using this but I'm gonna show

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.949 
just by using this but I'm gonna show
you<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.130> difference<00:04:02.519> between<00:04:02.599> just<00:04:03.599> using

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
you the difference between just using

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.190 
you the difference between just using
this<00:04:04.140> by<00:04:04.440> itself<00:04:05.060> versus<00:04:06.060> using<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.900> color

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
this by itself versus using a color

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.460 
this by itself versus using a color
corrector<00:04:07.709> with<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.180> really<00:04:09.569> cancel<00:04:10.110> out

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
corrector with this to really cancel out

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
can see the difference you can see that

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.240

there's<00:05:13.520> no<00:05:13.820> darkness<00:05:14.240> here<00:05:14.750> where<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.560> add<00:05:16.070> it

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
there's no darkness here where I add it

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.820 
there's no darkness here where I add it
in<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.580> orange<00:05:16.880> but<00:05:17.720> yet<00:05:17.930> you<00:05:18.080> can<00:05:18.260> see<00:05:18.530> a

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
in that orange but yet you can see a

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.700 
in that orange but yet you can see a
dark<00:05:19.340> shadow<00:05:19.670> here<00:05:21.160> see<00:05:22.160> that<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:24.320> there<00:05:24.560> is

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
dark shadow here see that so there is

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.240 
dark shadow here see that so there is
the<00:05:24.980> difference<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.530> definitely<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.920> lot

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
the difference this is definitely a lot

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.910 
the difference this is definitely a lot
brighter<00:05:28.640> and<00:05:29.060> completely<00:05:29.690> canceled<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:30.740> its

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
brighter and completely canceled of its

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.090 
brighter and completely canceled of its
darkness<00:05:31.220> compared<00:05:32.180> to<00:05:32.330> this<00:05:32.570> one<00:05:32.840> so<00:05:33.680> I'm

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
concealer with a translucent powder and

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.010 
concealer with a translucent powder and
that's<00:05:57.170> basically<00:05:57.650> it<00:05:58.150> so<00:05:59.150> I'm<00:05:59.480> going<00:05:59.750> to<00:05:59.810> just

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
that's basically it so I'm going to just

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.940 
that's basically it so I'm going to just
now<00:06:00.170> just<00:06:00.500> do<00:06:00.680> any<00:06:00.950> areas<00:06:01.460> that<00:06:01.490> just<00:06:02.950> need

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
now just do any areas that just need

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.250 
now just do any areas that just need
some<00:06:04.610> color<00:06:04.940> correcting<00:06:05.300> which<00:06:05.630> is<00:06:05.780> around<00:06:06.110> my

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
some color correcting which is around my

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.090 
some color correcting which is around my
mouth<00:06:06.470> and<00:06:06.830> most<00:06:07.520> women<00:06:07.760> of<00:06:07.970> color<00:06:08.830> have<00:06:09.830> like

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
mouth and most women of color have like

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.800 
mouth and most women of color have like
this<00:06:10.310> dark<00:06:11.020> thing<00:06:12.020> around<00:06:12.940> mouth<00:06:13.940> whatever

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
this dark thing around mouth whatever

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.200 
this dark thing around mouth whatever
that's<00:06:15.050> I<00:06:15.830> think<00:06:16.550> it's<00:06:16.730> just<00:06:16.850> like<00:06:17.060> the

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
that's I think it's just like the

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.550 
that's I think it's just like the
shading<00:06:17.540> of<00:06:17.840> our<00:06:17.990> skin

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.460 

so<00:06:23.560> that<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.490> how<00:06:24.759> you<00:06:24.840> completely<00:06:25.840> cancel<00:06:26.349> out

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
so that is how you completely cancel out

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.890 
so that is how you completely cancel out
those<00:06:26.680> dark<00:06:26.979> circles<00:06:27.250> with<00:06:28.210> on<00:06:28.479> things<00:06:28.810> that

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
those dark circles with on things that

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.240 
those dark circles with on things that
you<00:06:29.110> already<00:06:29.349> have<00:06:29.560> but<00:06:29.710> if<00:06:29.830> you<00:06:29.919> do<00:06:30.069> have<00:06:30.220> a

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
you already have but if you do have a

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.950 
you already have but if you do have a
color<00:06:30.490> corrector<00:06:30.849> and<00:06:31.180> you<00:06:31.270> just<00:06:31.509> never<00:06:31.690> used

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
color corrector and you just never used

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.570 
color corrector and you just never used
it<00:06:32.199> or<00:06:32.380> whatever<00:06:33.210> that's<00:06:34.210> how<00:06:34.389> you<00:06:34.449> use<00:06:34.780> it<00:06:34.990> so

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
it or whatever that's how you use it so

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.159 
it or whatever that's how you use it so
like<00:06:36.580> I<00:06:36.729> say<00:06:36.910> you<00:06:36.970> can<00:06:37.060> see<00:06:37.389> that<00:06:37.599> darkness<00:06:38.020> is

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
like I say you can see that darkness is

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.860 
like I say you can see that darkness is
gone<00:06:38.590> you<00:06:39.280> can<00:06:39.430> still<00:06:39.669> see<00:06:39.819> my<00:06:39.970> bags<00:06:40.240> because<00:06:40.750> I

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
gone you can still see my bags because I

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.689 
gone you can still see my bags because I
just<00:06:41.020> have<00:06:41.169> fatty<00:06:41.470> pockets<00:06:42.099> under<00:06:42.370> my<00:06:42.490> eyes

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
just have fatty pockets under my eyes

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.960 
just have fatty pockets under my eyes
