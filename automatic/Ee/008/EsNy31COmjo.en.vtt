00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.500
 this is the Italian pa is not 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.750
 scientific apis mellifera ligustica la 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.410
 ligustica is the subspecies of ours 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.599
 country a precious insect exported to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.730
 the whole world in the united states ad 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 example the flowers are impallinati from 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.750
 these bees 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.629
 unfortunately the ligustica for lack of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.390
 sensitivity rules and threatened precisely 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.699
 in its territory of origin but a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.730
 group of researchers and breeders yes 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.830
 an ambitious task is given to protect 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.830
 the DNA of this app is extraordinary 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.050
 Italian father or open ligustica yes it is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.910
 evolved over hundreds of 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.350
 thousands of years in the area of 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.160
 Mediterranean in particular in ours 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.290
 peninsula and therefore is the most suitable for 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.910
 variety of environment microclimate 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.850
 their guarantee of the territory that has the 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.979
 our own peninsula is also in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.260
 able to adapt to multiple others 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.340
 climate this the fact is the reason for 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.750
 which has become so widespread in the world too 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.150
 thanks to the features of 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.860
 productivity and other features 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.290
 superior from a biological point of view 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 from the characteristic yellow color 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.760
 ligustica is in fact the app is more used 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.080
 in the world for its biological value e 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.120
 productive 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.890
 the ligustica comes from our peninsula 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.210
 where he developed his own 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.850
 features 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.910
 in Europe this breed is not alone in it 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.470
 there are at least six other critical issues 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.500
 born on the borders 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.780
 here for lack of normative rules yes 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.570
 other breeds of bees are spreading 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.940
 especially the bee car is imported 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.370
 mica originally from central Europe 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.370
 these types of bees can mate 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 with the ligustica they are hybrids 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.780
 lacking in its features e 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.000
 adaptability for better 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.100
 enhance and qualify the Italian Pa 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.230
 the Ministry of Agricultural Policies 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.000
 food and forest wanted a book a 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.950
 National Register of Bee Breeders 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.560
 queens who collect all today one 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.590
 thirty breeders scattered throughout 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.590
 Italy 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.709
 the book deals with selection of bees 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.200
 queens say queen bee means to speak 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.810
 of all the bees of a colony since 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.480
 she is the mother of all of them in his 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.700
 life mates only once and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.459
 preserves then has an interior in the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.200
 spermatic together necessary for 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.480
 fertilize the eggs for the entire duration 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.030
 of his life in the near and therefore 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.410
 from the hive genetic bank that 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.910
 constitutes all the features 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.910
 of ligustica 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.819
 the book is a project that relies on 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.889
 scientific basis through analysis 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.739
 conducted by the research unit of 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.780
 beekeeping and silkworm breeding both in 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.599
 also able to certify genetically 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.939
 the different breeds of bees to define the 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.379
 ligustica specimens what there is 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.810
 interested are the genetic traits 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.700
 peculiar to ligustica like his 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.280
 production capacity and its ease 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.989
 of management 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.150
 also to deal with the phenomenon of 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.549
 mortality I was also evaluating 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.909
 character of resistance to diseases e 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.489
 of colonial vitality to this 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.930
 project gives life to 29 breeders 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.879
 registered in the register 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.699
 each of them is committed to producing 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.849
 of queens of ligustic race in 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:54.879
 sicily instead a breeder is busy 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.969
 to protect the Sicilian subspecies one 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.159
 penn was at risk of extinction a 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.719
 evaluation cycle and selection of bees 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.719
 certificate lasts three years 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.069
 the hope is that all beekeepers 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.819
 of the peninsula use queen bees of 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.980
 ligustica import ap from abroad 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.560
 compromising the genetic quality of the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.299
 our bees also behave and mixed 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.299
 in harsh new disease in Italy 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.530
 the current situation puts the company at risk 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.030
 biodiversity of bees without the help of 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.260
 world of beekeeping and the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.510
 institutions 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.610
 the custodians of the Italian Pa could 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.250
 be too weak and the treasure 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.460
 genetic that made our bees so 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.870
 important in the world could be altered 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.870
 irreversibly
