00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey guys welcome to yet another physics

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey guys welcome to yet another physics
video<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:04.170> both<00:00:04.560> feet<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.759> isn't<00:00:06.089> really

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
video on both feet and this isn't really

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.960 
video on both feet and this isn't really
going<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.540> be<00:00:07.250> solely<00:00:08.250> based<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.730> anything

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
going to be solely based on anything

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.339 
going to be solely based on anything
we've<00:00:09.269> been<00:00:09.300> studying<00:00:09.690> such<00:00:10.170> as

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
we've been studying such as

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.650 
we've been studying such as
radioactivity<00:00:10.889> or<00:00:11.130> electricity<00:00:11.910> rather<00:00:12.300> this

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
radioactivity or electricity rather this

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.220 
radioactivity or electricity rather this
will<00:00:12.840> be<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.230> how<00:00:14.099> do<00:00:14.160> stars<00:00:14.700> form<00:00:15.240> die<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
will be on how do stars form die and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.640 
will be on how do stars form die and
even<00:00:16.470> operate<00:00:17.600> so<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.199> quite<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
even operate so it's going to be quite a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.500 
even operate so it's going to be quite a
quick<00:00:19.890> explanation<00:00:20.220> very<00:00:20.789> brief<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.390> just

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
quick explanation very brief but it just

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
quick explanation very brief but it just
gives<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> nice<00:00:22.279> even<00:00:23.279> though<00:00:23.460> slightly

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
gives you a nice even though slightly

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570 
gives you a nice even though slightly
vague<00:00:24.060> idea<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.109> nature<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.039> stars<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
vague idea of the nature of stars and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
vague idea of the nature of stars and
how<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:26.910> their<00:00:27.180> stuff<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.920> let's<00:00:28.920> start

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
how they do their stuff so let's start

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.500 
how they do their stuff so let's start
off<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.369> how<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> star<00:00:30.570> forms<00:00:32.210> well<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.360> we

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
off with how a star forms well if we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.170 
off with how a star forms well if we
look<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.899> gas<00:00:34.170> cloud<00:00:34.850> there's<00:00:35.850> tons<00:00:36.059> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
look at this gas cloud there's tons of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
look at this gas cloud there's tons of
them<00:00:36.329> strewn<00:00:36.840> all<00:00:37.079> over<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.410> space<00:00:37.710> these

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
them strewn all over the space these

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.319 
them strewn all over the space these
random<00:00:38.670> interstellar<00:00:40.280> gas<00:00:41.280> clouds<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.969> just

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
random interstellar gas clouds that just

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.520 
random interstellar gas clouds that just
roam<00:00:42.540> around<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.989> place<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:45.110> sometimes<00:00:46.110> what

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
roam around the place and sometimes what

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
roam around the place and sometimes what
these<00:00:46.770> gas<00:00:47.039> clouds<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:47.969> can

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
these gas clouds can do is they can

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.850 
these gas clouds can do is they can
clump<00:00:48.510> together<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.500> due<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
clump together and this is due to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
clump together and this is due to
gravity<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:51.120> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> pushing<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
gravity it's kind of pushing in the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
gravity it's kind of pushing in the
cloud<00:00:52.379> together<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.489> clouds<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.239> bigger

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
cloud together and as clouds get bigger

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900 
cloud together and as clouds get bigger
their<00:00:55.230> gravitational<00:00:55.949> field<00:00:56.430> gets<00:00:56.670> stronger

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
their gravitational field gets stronger

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.540 
their gravitational field gets stronger
so<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.780> two<00:00:58.020> clouds<00:00:58.289> clumped<00:00:58.739> together<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so if two clouds clumped together the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.610 
so if two clouds clumped together the
whole<00:01:00.239> big<00:01:00.719> cloud<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
whole big cloud will have a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.229 
whole big cloud will have a
gravitational<00:01:02.190> field<00:01:02.670> strength<00:01:02.879> strong

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
gravitational field strength strong

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.260 
gravitational field strength strong
enough<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.439> pull<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.949> other<00:01:05.100> glass<00:01:05.489> gas

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
enough to then pull the other glass gas

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
enough to then pull the other glass gas
clouds<00:01:06.720> towards<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> when<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.520> big

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
clouds towards it and when it's big

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
clouds towards it and when it's big
enough<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.210> has<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> big<00:01:09.900> enough<00:01:10.170> solar<00:01:10.530> mass<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
enough and has a big enough solar mass I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.570 
enough and has a big enough solar mass I
think<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.450> about<00:01:12.720> something<00:01:13.549> over<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
think it's about something over a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
think it's about something over a
hundred<00:01:15.240> solar<00:01:15.689> masses<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> mass

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
hundred solar masses which is the mass

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.330 
hundred solar masses which is the mass
of<00:01:16.890> our<00:01:17.130> Sun<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.990> start<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.590> ignite<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of our Sun it will start to ignite and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
of our Sun it will start to ignite and
what<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.610> mean<00:01:20.759> by<00:01:20.820> ignite<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.750> all

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
what do I mean by ignite is that all

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
what do I mean by ignite is that all
this<00:01:22.140> pressure<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.890> gravitational

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this pressure all this gravitational

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.749 
this pressure all this gravitational
pulling<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.650> actually<00:01:25.650> caused<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.159> star<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pulling in actually caused the star to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.580 
pulling in actually caused the star to
initiate<00:01:27.210> its<00:01:27.420> process<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.200> nuclear<00:01:28.770> fusion

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
initiate its process of nuclear fusion

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.940 
initiate its process of nuclear fusion
and<00:01:32.479> well<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.020> later<00:01:34.229> let's<00:01:34.740> look

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and well that's a bit later let's look

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.749 
and well that's a bit later let's look
at<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.220> protostar<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.570> protostar<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
at this protostar this protostar is

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
at this protostar this protostar is
basically<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.000> gas<00:01:39.390> cloud<00:01:39.720> turns<00:01:40.049> into

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
basically what the gas cloud turns into

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.370 
basically what the gas cloud turns into
when<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> has<00:01:40.950> clumped<00:01:41.400> into<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> huge<00:01:42.270> clump<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
when it has clumped into a huge clump of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
when it has clumped into a huge clump of
gas<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.399> stars<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:44.820> made<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
gas we know that stars are made up of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.359 
gas we know that stars are made up of
plasma<00:01:45.750> which<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.259> ionized<00:01:46.680> gas<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.280> at

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
plasma which is just ionized gas but at

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.569 
plasma which is just ionized gas but at
this<00:01:47.490> point<00:01:48.110> they're<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.409> kind<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> gas<00:01:50.280> or

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
this point they're just kind of gas or

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.270 
this point they're just kind of gas or
plasma<00:01:50.700> no<00:01:51.630> nuclear<00:01:52.020> fusion<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.979> or

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
plasma no nuclear fusion going on or

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.999 
plasma no nuclear fusion going on or
anything<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:55.200> ball<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.710> gas<00:01:58.009> then

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
anything it's just this ball of gas then

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.350 
anything it's just this ball of gas then
when<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> starts<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.930> nuclear<00:02:01.350> fusion<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
when it starts to do nuclear fusion and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.490 
when it starts to do nuclear fusion and
actually<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.659> need<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> explain<00:02:03.960> nuclear

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
actually think I need to explain nuclear

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.940 
actually think I need to explain nuclear
fusion<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.979> made<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.200> sorry<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> video

nuclear fusion is still going right now

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.690 
nuclear fusion is still going right now
so<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.120> does<00:03:20.300> take<00:03:20.600> quite<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.900> long<00:03:21.080> time<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.870 
to carbon only takes millions of years
compared<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.739> hydrogen<00:03:40.190> turning<00:03:40.730> into

one<00:04:32.190> year<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.670> it's<00:04:33.060> kind<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.420> hard<00:04:33.630> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
one year and it's kind of hard to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.200 
one year and it's kind of hard to
imagine<00:04:33.990> something<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:34.740> our<00:04:34.920> Sun<00:04:35.280> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
imagine something like our Sun the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.300 
imagine something like our Sun the
source<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.690> oxygen<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.650> does<00:04:37.860> seem<00:04:38.280> pretty

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
source of oxygen it does seem pretty

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.540 
source of oxygen it does seem pretty
weird<00:04:38.820> doesn't<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.180> but<00:04:39.420> anyway<00:04:40.370> oxygen<00:04:41.370> is

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
weird doesn't it but anyway oxygen is

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.720 
weird doesn't it but anyway oxygen is
not<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.300> last<00:04:42.510> thing<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.900> also<00:04:43.080> fuses<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.550> it

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
not the last thing it also fuses and it

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.930 
not the last thing it also fuses and it
fuses<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.330> silicon<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:47.370> last<00:04:47.610> thing

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
three to five days this is incredibly

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.490 
three to five days this is incredibly

way to iron the star is actually

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.550 
way to iron the star is actually
expanding<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.930> might<00:05:10.200> be<00:05:10.350> quite

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
expanding this might be quite

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.130 
expanding this might be quite
distracting<00:05:10.920> but<00:05:11.280> anyway<00:05:11.720> it's<00:05:12.720> basically

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
distracting but anyway it's basically

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.560 
distracting but anyway it's basically
showing<00:05:13.440> this<00:05:13.890> star<00:05:14.190> turning<00:05:14.850> into<00:05:15.210> what<00:05:15.450> we

showing this star turning into what we

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.900 
showing this star turning into what we

bigger stars a supergiant our star will

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.690 
bigger stars a supergiant our star will
turn<00:05:21.300> into<00:05:21.540> a<00:05:21.570> red<00:05:21.840> giant<00:05:21.870> as<00:05:22.620> nuclear<00:05:23.400> fusion

hits the helium carbon neon oxygen
silicon<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.400> iron<00:05:26.520> stages<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.800> what<00:05:28.800> happens

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
silicon and iron stages and what happens

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.630 
silicon and iron stages and what happens
when<00:05:29.430> it<00:05:29.490> hits<00:05:29.730> iron<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.300> quite<00:05:30.600> special<00:05:31.110> in

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
when it hits iron is quite special in

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.150 
when it hits iron is quite special in
order<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:32.790> fuse<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.420> iron

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
order to fuse to iron

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.920 
order to fuse to iron
okay<00:05:35.160> now<00:05:35.340> usually<00:05:35.700> when<00:05:36.120> nuclear<00:05:36.690> fusion

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
okay now usually when nuclear fusion

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.860 
okay now usually when nuclear fusion
occurs<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:38.160> amount<00:05:38.370> of<00:05:38.550> energy<00:05:39.030> required<00:05:39.420> to

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
occurs the amount of energy required to

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.980 
occurs the amount of energy required to
fuse<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:41.010> nuclei<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.970> elements<00:05:42.390> together<00:05:42.570> is

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
fuse the nuclei the elements together is

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.410 
fuse the nuclei the elements together is
less<00:05:43.860> than<00:05:44.040> the<00:05:44.190> amount<00:05:44.370> of<00:05:44.550> energy<00:05:44.910> given<00:05:45.270> out

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
less than the amount of energy given out

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.450 
less than the amount of energy given out
so<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.900> Sun<00:05:46.140> is<00:05:46.290> giving<00:05:46.440> itself<00:05:46.890> energy<00:05:47.340> and

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
so the Sun is giving itself energy and

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.090 
so the Sun is giving itself energy and
sustaining<00:05:47.880> itself<00:05:48.180> however<00:05:49.170> with<00:05:49.500> iron<00:05:49.770> in

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
sustaining itself however with iron in

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.960 
sustaining itself however with iron in
order<00:05:50.310> to<00:05:50.430> fuse<00:05:51.980> it<00:05:52.980> actually<00:05:53.460> requires<00:05:53.850> more

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
order to fuse it actually requires more

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.450 
order to fuse it actually requires more
energy<00:05:54.360> given<00:05:54.990> in<00:05:55.140> into<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.530> fusion<00:05:55.800> reaction

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
energy given in into the fusion reaction

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.750 
energy given in into the fusion reaction
than<00:05:56.790> is<00:05:56.970> given<00:05:57.330> out<00:05:57.530> so<00:05:58.530> this<00:05:58.710> means<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.400> star

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
than is given out so this means the star

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.460 
than is given out so this means the star
has<00:06:00.270> no<00:06:00.600> more<00:06:00.900> energy<00:06:01.170> to<00:06:02.100> support<00:06:02.550> itself<00:06:02.910> and

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
has no more energy to support itself and

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.850 
has no more energy to support itself and
will<00:06:04.470> collapse<00:06:04.860> in<00:06:05.630> smaller<00:06:06.630> stars<00:06:07.020> such<00:06:07.680> as

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
will collapse in smaller stars such as

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.310 
will collapse in smaller stars such as
our<00:06:08.010> Sun<00:06:08.370> it<00:06:09.060> will<00:06:09.240> shed<00:06:09.480> off<00:06:09.690> its<00:06:10.050> outer

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
our Sun it will shed off its outer

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.350 
our Sun it will shed off its outer
layers<00:06:10.980> and<00:06:11.130> turn<00:06:11.670> into<00:06:11.910> a<00:06:12.060> white<00:06:12.390> dwarf<00:06:14.360> so

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
layers and turn into a white dwarf so

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.170 
layers and turn into a white dwarf so
just<00:06:16.110> imagine<00:06:16.350> a<00:06:16.770> human<00:06:17.190> body<00:06:17.370> take<00:06:17.880> off<00:06:18.030> all

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180

just imagine a human body take off all

the skin take off all the muscles just

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.710 
the skin take off all the muscles just
the<00:06:20.190> bone<00:06:20.370> underneath<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:21.120> that's<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.540> white

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
like the star baitul goose or Canis

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.740 
like the star baitul goose or Canis
Majoris<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.449> big<00:06:54.599> dog<00:06:55.789> what<00:06:56.789> they<00:06:56.939> go<00:06:57.180> what

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
Majoris the big dog what they go what

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.059 
Majoris the big dog what they go what
they<00:06:57.900> do<00:06:57.960> is<00:06:58.319> they<00:06:58.979> undergo<00:06:59.520> a<00:06:59.550> supernova<00:07:01.069> so

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069 
they do is they undergo a supernova so

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.010 
they do is they undergo a supernova so
basically<00:07:02.610> since<00:07:02.939> the<00:07:03.060> star<00:07:03.360> is<00:07:03.449> collapsing

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
basically since the star is collapsing

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.209 
basically since the star is collapsing
it<00:07:04.110> doesn't<00:07:04.319> have<00:07:04.409> enough<00:07:04.590> energy<00:07:04.680> to<00:07:04.979> sustain

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:05.219 
it doesn't have enough energy to sustain

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:08.839 
it doesn't have enough energy to sustain
itself<00:07:05.669> the<00:07:05.939> star<00:07:06.240> shrinks<00:07:06.689> and<00:07:07.289> it<00:07:08.159> gets<00:07:08.490> more

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
itself the star shrinks and it gets more

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.140 
itself the star shrinks and it gets more
dense<00:07:09.180> and<00:07:09.650> soon<00:07:10.650> when<00:07:11.400> it<00:07:11.520> gets<00:07:11.669> too<00:07:11.909> dense

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
dense and soon when it gets too dense

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.959 
dense and soon when it gets too dense
all<00:07:12.539> that<00:07:12.689> shrinking<00:07:13.110> stops<00:07:13.639> that<00:07:14.639> quick

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:14.969 
all that shrinking stops that quick

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.240 
all that shrinking stops that quick
halting<00:07:15.479> creates<00:07:15.900> a<00:07:16.080> massive<00:07:16.710> shock<00:07:17.009> wave

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
halting creates a massive shock wave

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.999 
halting creates a massive shock wave
that<00:07:17.460> ripples<00:07:17.819> across<00:07:18.330> the<00:07:18.509> star<00:07:18.810> and<00:07:19.080> blows

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009 
that ripples across the star and blows

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:25.909 
that ripples across the star and blows
it<00:07:20.039> up<00:07:20.400> in<00:07:20.870> a<00:07:21.870> supernova<00:07:22.830> and<00:07:23.180> the<00:07:24.180> result<00:07:24.569> is<00:07:24.919> a

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 
it up in a supernova and the result is a

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.300 
it up in a supernova and the result is a
black<00:07:26.580> hole<00:07:27.500> I'm<00:07:28.500> sure<00:07:28.800> you've<00:07:28.949> all<00:07:29.069> heard<00:07:29.189> of

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
black hole I'm sure you've all heard of

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.219 
black hole I'm sure you've all heard of
black<00:07:29.550> holes<00:07:29.789> they<00:07:30.090> suck<00:07:30.360> in<00:07:30.389> everything<00:07:31.020> near

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
black holes they suck in everything near

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.700 
black holes they suck in everything near
it<00:07:31.349> and<00:07:31.469> where<00:07:32.340> does<00:07:32.430> it<00:07:32.490> go<00:07:32.610> we<00:07:33.120> don't<00:07:33.270> know<00:07:33.710> so

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710 
it and where does it go we don't know so

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.879 
it and where does it go we don't know so
yeah<00:07:34.949> that's<00:07:35.430> the<00:07:35.699> death<00:07:36.000> of<00:07:36.240> a<00:07:36.509> star<00:07:36.900> so<00:07:37.770> yeah

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:37.889 
yeah that's the death of a star so yeah

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.580 
yeah that's the death of a star so yeah
