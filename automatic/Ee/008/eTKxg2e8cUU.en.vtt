00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.039 

the<00:00:10.370> first<00:00:10.610> steps<00:00:10.940> to<00:00:11.120> checking<00:00:11.510> your<00:00:11.629> Pistons

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
the first steps to checking your Pistons

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.170 
the first steps to checking your Pistons
rods<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.590> rings<00:00:12.860> are<00:00:13.129> so<00:00:13.400> when<00:00:13.820> you<00:00:13.910> pull<00:00:14.090> the

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
rods and rings are so when you pull the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.240 
rods and rings are so when you pull the
piston<00:00:14.630> rod<00:00:14.900> out<00:00:15.170> you're<00:00:15.889> going<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.040> want<00:00:16.099> to

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
piston rod out you're going to want to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.550 
piston rod out you're going to want to
check<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.640> end<00:00:16.790> caps<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:17.450> the<00:00:17.750> rod<00:00:17.960> for<00:00:18.380> any

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
check the end caps and the rod for any

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.609 
check the end caps and the rod for any
kind<00:00:18.860> of<00:00:18.920> color<00:00:19.270> if<00:00:20.270> it's<00:00:20.480> black<00:00:20.840> it<00:00:21.320> doesn't

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
kind of color if it's black it doesn't

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.370 
kind of color if it's black it doesn't
matter<00:00:21.770> if<00:00:21.890> it's<00:00:22.009> brown<00:00:22.310> or<00:00:23.090> gray<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.349> color

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
matter if it's brown or gray the color

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.740 
matter if it's brown or gray the color
of<00:00:24.649> metal<00:00:24.800> but<00:00:25.220> if<00:00:25.279> it's<00:00:25.430> dark<00:00:25.700> black<00:00:26.090> or<00:00:26.480> dark

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
of metal but if it's dark black or dark

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.990 
of metal but if it's dark black or dark
purple<00:00:26.890> that<00:00:27.890> means<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.430> rod<00:00:28.640> was

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
purple that means that the rod was

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.350 
purple that means that the rod was
either<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.529> spun<00:00:30.829> a<00:00:30.860> rod<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:31.849> overheated

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
either it's spun a rod and it overheated

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.319 
either it's spun a rod and it overheated
and<00:00:32.689> check<00:00:33.649> your<00:00:33.770> bearings<00:00:34.130> also<00:00:34.370> if<00:00:35.149> your

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
and check your bearings also if your

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.959 
and check your bearings also if your
bearings<00:00:35.690> are<00:00:35.870> really<00:00:36.170> flat<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:37.550> thickness

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
bearings are really flat the thickness

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.360 
bearings are really flat the thickness
and<00:00:38.270> then<00:00:38.360> stretched<00:00:38.780> out<00:00:39.020> with<00:00:39.440> then<00:00:40.130> that's

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
and then stretched out with then that's

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.640 
and then stretched out with then that's
it<00:00:40.610> it's<00:00:40.820> toast<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.570> you'll<00:00:41.870> also<00:00:42.050> be<00:00:42.380> a<00:00:42.410> lot

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
it it's toast and you'll also be a lot

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.340 
it it's toast and you'll also be a lot
thinner<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:44.030> check<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.300> out<00:00:44.540> then<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.140> rods

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
thinner you check that out then the rods

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.890 
thinner you check that out then the rods
are<00:00:45.560> okay<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.190> less<00:00:46.760> also<00:00:47.120> another<00:00:47.570> point

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
are okay and less also another point

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.480 
are okay and less also another point
would<00:00:48.020> be<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.350> brought<00:00:48.560> is<00:00:48.710> bent<00:00:49.070> where<00:00:49.340> it's

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
would be that brought is bent where it's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.330 
would be that brought is bent where it's
it's<00:00:50.060> in<00:00:50.270> like<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:50.480> u-shape<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.950> has<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.220> be

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
it's in like a u-shape it has to be

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.600 
it's in like a u-shape it has to be
straight<00:00:53.740> so<00:00:54.740> that's<00:00:54.950> pretty<00:00:55.190> much<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.430> for

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
straight so that's pretty much it for

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.080 
straight so that's pretty much it for
the<00:00:55.820> rods<00:00:57.190> for<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.220> Pistons

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
the rods for the Pistons

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.810 
the rods for the Pistons
you<00:00:59.870> want<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.170> check<00:01:00.410> your<00:01:00.710> ring<00:01:01.310> ones<00:01:01.579> in

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
you want to check your ring ones in

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.420 
you want to check your ring ones in
between<00:01:02.239> your<00:01:02.450> rings<00:01:02.739> right<00:01:03.739> in<00:01:03.920> between<00:01:04.070> them

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
between your rings right in between them

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.340 
between your rings right in between them
you'll<00:01:05.180> see<00:01:05.420> little<00:01:05.600> lines<00:01:05.899> where<00:01:06.229> it's

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
you'll see little lines where it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.010 
you'll see little lines where it's
cracked<00:01:06.729> also<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:08.420> want<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:08.600> check<00:01:08.840> your

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
cracked also you want to check your

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.410 
cracked also you want to check your
rings<00:01:09.460> if<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.670> don't<00:01:10.850> know<00:01:10.940> how<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.150> take<00:01:11.360> a

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
rings if you don't know how to take a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.710 
rings if you don't know how to take a
piston<00:01:11.930> ring<00:01:12.110> off<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.580> first<00:01:13.580> way<00:01:14.120> is<00:01:14.150> is<00:01:14.600> you

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
piston ring off the first way is is you

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.350 
piston ring off the first way is is you
find<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.050> opening<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:16.190> pull<00:01:16.490> on<00:01:16.760> one<00:01:17.000> side

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
find the opening you pull on one side

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.660 
find the opening you pull on one side
and<00:01:17.600> slip<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:18.020> one<00:01:18.200> side<00:01:18.470> up<00:01:18.770> just<00:01:19.040> like<00:01:19.610> that

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
and slip the one side up just like that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.660 
and slip the one side up just like that
and<00:01:20.120> then<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.080> run<00:01:21.320> your<00:01:21.500> few<00:01:21.770> push<00:01:22.070> back<00:01:22.370> as

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
and then you run your few push back as

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.930 
and then you run your few push back as
you're<00:01:22.850> running<00:01:23.150> your<00:01:23.270> finger<00:01:23.659> around<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.200> and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
you're running your finger around it and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.610 
you're running your finger around it and
you<00:01:25.940> kind<00:01:26.150> of<00:01:26.270> just<00:01:26.510> slide<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.960> off<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:27.440> like

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
you kind of just slide it off just like

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.430 
you kind of just slide it off just like
that<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.479> they<00:01:29.479> come<00:01:29.630> up<00:01:29.780> nice<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.200> easy<00:01:30.290> you

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
that and they come up nice and easy you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.560 
that and they come up nice and easy you
don't<00:01:30.620> need<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.860> pull<00:01:31.100> up<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.820> try<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.030> yank<00:01:32.299> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
don't need to pull up and try to yank it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.570 
don't need to pull up and try to yank it
and<00:01:32.780> bend<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.380> could<00:01:33.860> damage<00:01:34.040> your<00:01:34.370> ring

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
and bend it you could damage your ring

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.219 
and bend it you could damage your ring
ones<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> process<00:01:35.540> because<00:01:35.840> these<00:01:35.960> are

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
ones in the process because these are

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.609 
ones in the process because these are
steel<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.950> this<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.150> aluminum<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:39.380> we're

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
steel and this is just aluminum so we're

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.830 
steel and this is just aluminum so we're
going<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.799> take<00:01:39.950> these<00:01:40.130> out<00:01:40.430> real<00:01:40.670> quick<00:01:40.970> same

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
going to take these out real quick same

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.880 
going to take these out real quick same
process<00:01:42.409> pull<00:01:42.799> up<00:01:43.270> push<00:01:44.270> back<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.720> little<00:01:45.080> bit

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.800 

and<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:48.979> pull<00:01:49.340> them<00:01:49.430> off<00:01:49.580> like<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.060> same

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
and just pull them off like that same

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.510 
and just pull them off like that same
process<00:01:51.049> with<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.270> little<00:01:53.270> rings<00:01:54.310> too<00:01:55.310> real

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
process with the little rings too real

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.940 
process with the little rings too real
tiny<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.270> got<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.510> find<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.869> spot

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.130 

and<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.060> same<00:02:02.270> principle<00:02:02.840> when<00:02:03.020> you're

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
and it's the same principle when you're

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.960 
and it's the same principle when you're
putting<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.740> I'll<00:02:04.250> show<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.580> how<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.730> put

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
putting them on I'll show you how to put

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:16.300 
putting them on I'll show you how to put
a<00:02:05.000> ring<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.500> later<00:02:13.720> now<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.960> you've<00:02:15.280> got<00:02:16.280> that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
a ring on later now that you've got that
