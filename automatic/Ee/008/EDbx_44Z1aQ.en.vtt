flavored and if you open it up hopefully
it's<00:02:18.569> not<00:02:18.659> super<00:02:19.469> sticky<00:02:19.829> let's<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.129> what

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
it's not super sticky let's see what

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.160 
it's not super sticky let's see what
we've<00:02:20.340> got<00:02:20.370> here

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.450 

these<00:02:25.170> kinds<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.560> things<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:26.010> be<00:02:26.100> tricky

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
these kinds of things can be tricky

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.810 
these kinds of things can be tricky
depending<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.210> course<00:02:27.540> how<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:28.820> old

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
depending on of course how you know old

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.450 
depending on of course how you know old
something<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.900> hard<00:02:31.560> time<00:02:31.710> getting<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.250> out

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
something is a hard time getting it out

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.650 
something is a hard time getting it out
of<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:32.850> let's<00:02:33.120> see<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:34.310> maybe<00:02:35.420> try<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.480> open

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
of here let's see here maybe try to open

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.690 
of here let's see here maybe try to open
it<00:02:36.900> up<00:02:37.020> usually<00:02:37.680> these<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:38.070> supposed<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.490> not

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
it up usually these are supposed to not

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.500 
it up usually these are supposed to not
be<00:02:38.910> too<00:02:39.120> messy<00:02:39.450> um<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:41.100> know<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.370> stuff<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
be too messy um you know the stuff the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.150 
be too messy um you know the stuff the
companies<00:02:42.900> here<00:02:43.200> try<00:02:43.410> pretty<00:02:43.620> hard<00:02:43.710> it<00:02:44.040> could

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
companies here try pretty hard it could

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.890 
companies here try pretty hard it could
be<00:02:44.370> because<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.120> change<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.720> temperature

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
be because of the change in temperature

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.790 
be because of the change in temperature
in<00:02:46.410> Japan<00:02:47.010> right<00:02:47.160> now<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:49.110> know<00:02:49.140> these

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
in Japan right now that you know these

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.670 
in Japan right now that you know these
things<00:02:50.160> can<00:02:50.400> become<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.790> little<00:02:51.440> harder<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.560> get

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
things can become a little harder to get

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.390 
things can become a little harder to get
out<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.860> here<00:02:54.500> when<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.560> get<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.890> humidity

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
out of here when you get the humidity

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.800 
out of here when you get the humidity
and<00:02:56.490> all<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.760> coming<00:02:57.000> along<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.270> can<00:02:57.540> make<00:02:57.690> it

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
and all that coming along I can make it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.140 
and all that coming along I can make it
pretty<00:02:58.050> hard<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:59.640> something<00:02:59.850> like<00:02:59.940> this

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
pretty hard to do something like this

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.600 
pretty hard to do something like this
but<00:03:00.360> anyways<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:00.960> is<00:03:01.020> basically<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:02.190> smells

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
but anyways this is basically it smells

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.330 
but anyways this is basically it smells
like<00:03:02.700> totally<00:03:03.210> like<00:03:03.240> Cola<00:03:03.900> flis<00:03:04.230> stuff<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
like totally like Cola flis stuff you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.400 
like totally like Cola flis stuff you
could<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:05.940> use<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.330> then<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.290> know

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
could just use this then to you know

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.020 
could just use this then to you know
stick<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.490> mold<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
stick it on to this mold and the the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.640 
stick it on to this mold and the the
idea<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.660> don't<00:03:12.990> know<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.110> guess<00:03:13.320> if<00:03:13.530> your

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
then pretend is like eating a squid or

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.400 
then pretend is like eating a squid or
an<00:03:43.800> octopus<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.020> don't<00:03:46.020> know<00:03:46.080> how<00:03:46.200> much<00:03:46.380> that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
an octopus so I don't know how much that

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.290 
an octopus so I don't know how much that
looks<00:03:46.740> like<00:03:46.920> really<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.730> squid<00:03:48.180> or

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
looks like really like a squid or

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.590 
looks like really like a squid or
octopus<00:03:48.810> perfect<00:03:49.970> that's<00:03:50.970> kind<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.450> what

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
octopus perfect that's kind of what

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.960 
octopus perfect that's kind of what
you're<00:03:51.750> shooting<00:03:51.930> for<00:03:52.430> it's<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.700> little

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
you're shooting for it's a little

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.650 
you're shooting for it's a little
strange<00:03:54.180> looking<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:56.060> think<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.450> give<00:03:57.630> up

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
strange looking I think I just give up

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.510 
strange looking I think I just give up
and<00:03:57.900> eat<00:03:58.080> it<00:03:58.230> gets<00:03:58.500> kind<00:03:58.770> of<00:03:58.830> messy<00:03:58.890> um

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
and eat it gets kind of messy um

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.460 
and eat it gets kind of messy um
normally<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.810> know<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.050> in<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.230> wintertime

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
normally you know like in the wintertime

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.620 
normally you know like in the wintertime
it's<00:04:01.800> not<00:04:02.010> nearly<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.400> messy<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.970> think<00:04:03.450> once

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
it's not nearly this messy I think once

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.150 
it's not nearly this messy I think once
it<00:04:03.750> gets<00:04:03.900> hotter<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.290> more<00:04:04.410> humid<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.890> gets<00:04:05.070> a

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
it gets hotter and more humid it gets a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.840 
it gets hotter and more humid it gets a
little<00:04:05.310> gross<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.560> uh<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.460> know<00:04:08.580> as<00:04:08.820> a

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
little gross so but uh you know as a

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.610 
little gross so but uh you know as a
snack<00:04:09.210> it's<00:04:09.420> not<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.720> bad<00:04:09.870> tasting<00:04:10.410> it's

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
snack it's not that bad tasting it's

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.030 
snack it's not that bad tasting it's
pretty<00:04:10.830> good<00:04:11.070> um<00:04:12.050> but<00:04:13.050> you<00:04:13.230> could<00:04:13.620> see<00:04:13.770> here

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
pretty good um but you could see here

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.470 
pretty good um but you could see here
obviously<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.730> think<00:04:14.970> they<00:04:15.060> wanted<00:04:15.090> you

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
obviously that I think they wanted you

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.120 
obviously that I think they wanted you
to<00:04:15.510> try<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.810> maybe<00:04:16.049> make<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.710> legs<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:17.010> little

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
to try to maybe make the legs a little

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.789 
to try to maybe make the legs a little
shorter<00:04:17.609> but<00:04:17.790> it's<00:04:18.720> basically<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.290> melting

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
shorter but it's basically just melting

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.350 
shorter but it's basically just melting
in<00:04:19.859> my<00:04:19.890> hands<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:22.250> little<00:04:23.250> gross<00:04:23.520> maybe<00:04:23.820> but

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
in my hands so a little gross maybe but

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.260 
in my hands so a little gross maybe but
