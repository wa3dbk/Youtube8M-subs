bike motor we build a pipe for it as
well<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.850> basic<00:00:36.239> frame

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600

wired<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.360> I'll<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.350> she<00:01:31.409> goes

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
wired it up now so I'll see how she goes

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.340 
wired it up now so I'll see how she goes
because<00:01:34.020> power<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> edge<00:01:34.860> bridge

because power up the edge bridge

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:50.170 
because power up the edge bridge
then<00:01:36.979> pair<00:01:37.250> up<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.619> Hector<00:01:39.619> server<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:49.180> she

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
then pair up the Hector server and she

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.249 
then pair up the Hector server and she
works<00:01:52.149> spit<00:01:53.149> sloppy<00:01:53.479> eat<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.840> wheels<00:01:54.020> are<00:01:54.200> a

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
works spit sloppy eat the wheels are a

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.789 
works spit sloppy eat the wheels are a
bit<00:01:54.380> sloppy<00:01:54.649> but<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:56.360> has<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.170> bit<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.320> honking

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
bit sloppy but it has a bit of honking

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.719 
bit sloppy but it has a bit of honking
on<00:01:57.920> me<00:01:58.070> there's<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.399> bit<00:01:58.520> of<00:02:01.990> just<00:02:02.990> being<00:02:03.140> very

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
on me there's a bit of just being very

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.650 
on me there's a bit of just being very
rationally<00:02:04.729> hooked<00:02:04.940> up<00:02:05.149> just<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.539> test<00:02:06.970> contact

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.080 

so<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:13.010> actually<00:02:13.190> worked<00:02:13.550> better<00:02:13.790> than<00:02:13.910> I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so it's actually worked better than I

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.780 
so it's actually worked better than I
thought<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.360> I'm<00:02:14.630> happy<00:02:14.810> with<00:02:14.959> that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
thought so I'm happy with that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.850 
thought so I'm happy with that
and<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:16.940> quite<00:02:17.690> fast<00:02:20.500> turns<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.709> way

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
and it's quite fast turns that way

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.400 
and it's quite fast turns that way
better<00:02:22.310> than<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.610> turns<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:22.970> way<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
better than it turns that way but the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.949 
better than it turns that way but the
final<00:02:27.310> final<00:02:28.310> model<00:02:29.890> would<00:02:30.890> be<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.069> lot<00:02:31.250> better

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
final final model would be a lot better

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.690 
final final model would be a lot better
so<00:02:32.959> that's<00:02:33.290> how<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.590> use<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:35.920> homemade<00:02:36.920> server

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
so that's how you use a homemade server

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.910 
so that's how you use a homemade server
it's<00:02:38.420> got<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.600> lot<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:38.989> power<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.709> don't

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
it's got a lot of power and that I don't

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.210 
it's got a lot of power and that I don't
know<00:02:40.010> how<00:02:40.130> much<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.820> lot<00:02:41.560> using<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.709> window

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
know how much but a lot using a window

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.220 
know how much but a lot using a window

motor<00:02:58.519> controller<00:02:58.880> which<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.390> actually

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
motor controller which you can actually

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.530 
motor controller which you can actually
build<00:02:59.870> these<00:03:00.109> yourself<00:03:00.910> they<00:03:01.910> then<00:03:02.239> have<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
build these yourself they then have to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.599 
build these yourself they then have to
be<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.440> bought<00:03:03.799> this<00:03:03.950> cousins<00:03:04.940> cheaper<00:03:06.609> but

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
be is I bought this cousins cheaper but

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.220 
be is I bought this cousins cheaper but
you<00:03:07.850> don't<00:03:08.030> really<00:03:08.209> need<00:03:08.450> most<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.870> their<00:03:08.989> crap

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
you don't really need most of their crap

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.380 
you don't really need most of their crap
just<00:03:10.269> these<00:03:11.269> four<00:03:11.570> MOSFETs<00:03:12.079> really<00:03:13.600> using<00:03:14.600> the

yeah<00:03:24.209> one<00:03:24.780> day<00:03:25.040> I'm<00:03:26.040> waiting<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.340> an<00:03:26.489> engine

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
yeah one day I'm waiting for an engine

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.020 
yeah one day I'm waiting for an engine
on<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:27.560> but<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:28.980> my<00:03:29.280> um<00:03:30.200> fourth<00:03:31.200> scale

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
on it but that is my um fourth scale

it's got a workout accelerator and brake
setup<00:04:05.540> with<00:04:06.540> all<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.750> cables<00:04:07.139> going<00:04:07.349> on<00:04:08.329> but

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
setup with all the cables going on but

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.729 
setup with all the cables going on but
um<00:04:09.480> hmm<00:04:10.909> so<00:04:11.909> only<00:04:12.269> thing<00:04:12.540> now<00:04:12.689> is<00:04:12.750> box<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:13.650> the

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
um hmm so only thing now is box all the

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.990 
um hmm so only thing now is box all the
spaghetti<00:04:13.980> up<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.470> mount<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.590> properly<00:04:17.000> we'll

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
spaghetti up and mount it properly we'll

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.460 
spaghetti up and mount it properly we'll
some<00:04:18.180> plugs<00:04:18.449> coming<00:04:18.810> out<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.049> box<00:04:19.229> so

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
some plugs coming out of the box so

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.730 
some plugs coming out of the box so
everything<00:04:19.889> just<00:04:20.070> plugs<00:04:20.549> in<00:04:20.729> easily<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.740> no

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
everything just plugs in easily and no

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.580 
everything just plugs in easily and no
messing<00:04:23.099> around<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:24.320> that'll<00:04:25.320> be<00:04:25.380> good

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
messing around so that'll be good

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.029 
messing around so that'll be good
I<00:04:25.710> left<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.099> ramp<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.550> smaller<00:04:27.860> 12<00:04:28.860> volt

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
I left the ramp a smaller 12 volt

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:39.320 
I left the ramp a smaller 12 volt
battery<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.580> saw<00:04:29.940> there<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:31.220> motor<00:04:35.419> sits<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
battery and saw there the motor sits and

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.719 
battery and saw there the motor sits and
they<00:04:39.780> like<00:04:39.960> that

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
they like that

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.589 
they like that
I'm<00:04:41.729> gonna<00:04:41.880> move<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.180> pot<00:04:43.909> I'll<00:04:44.909> redirect<00:04:45.240> it

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
I'm gonna move that pot I'll redirect it

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:53.480 
I'm gonna move that pot I'll redirect it
so<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:46.080> should<00:04:46.260> work<00:04:46.409> out<00:04:48.080> quite<00:04:49.080> well<00:04:52.490> yeah

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
so that should work out quite well yeah

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:01.790 
so that should work out quite well yeah
she<00:04:53.699> works<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:57.620> bit<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.889> jokey<00:04:59.280> bit

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.469 

I<00:05:02.389> can<00:05:03.389> fix<00:05:03.569> that<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.780> bit<00:05:03.960> later<00:05:05.240> time<00:05:06.240> exactly

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
I can fix that a bit later time exactly

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.930 
I can fix that a bit later time exactly
now<00:05:06.750> how
