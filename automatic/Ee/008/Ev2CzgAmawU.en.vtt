actually is and the book actually takes

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
actually is and the book actually takes
itself<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.860> seriously<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
itself like that seriously but not in a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.440 
itself like that seriously but not in a
to<00:01:19.200> annoying<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.009> think<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.820> only<00:01:21.030> actual

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
to annoying way I think it's only actual

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.660 
to annoying way I think it's only actual
flows<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.950> main<00:01:23.189> character

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
flows are that the main character

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 
flows are that the main character
actually<00:01:23.820> gives<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.630> opinions<00:01:25.500> on

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
actually gives like opinions on

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
actually gives like opinions on
humankind<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.210> major

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
humankind and on like major

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.469 
humankind and on like major
philosophical<00:01:27.990> themes<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:29.220> based<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.790> his

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
philosophical themes just based on his

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
philosophical themes just based on his
own<00:01:30.659> personal<00:01:31.140> experience<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> takes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
own personal experience and so it takes

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.819 
own personal experience and so it takes
like<00:01:32.700> his<00:01:32.850> life<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.750> makes<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.170> Universal

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
like his life and it makes it Universal

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.069 
like his life and it makes it Universal
but<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
but I think that this is like just a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
but I think that this is like just a
flow<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.619> main<00:01:37.740> character<00:01:38.100> or<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
flow of the main character or not of the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
flow of the main character or not of the
offer<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> character<00:01:39.570> itself<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.140> times
