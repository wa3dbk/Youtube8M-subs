00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.510 
there's two key factors of why i think
that<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.229> are<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.770> good<00:01:31.950> evident<00:01:32.340> point

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that that are really good evident point

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
that that are really good evident point
evidence<00:01:32.939> points<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.720> backing<00:01:34.049> up

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
evidence points that I think backing up

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.830 
evidence points that I think backing up
pretty<00:01:34.619> well<00:01:34.820> now<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> fact<00:01:36.720> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
pretty well now one is the fact that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
pretty well now one is the fact that
rockstar<00:01:37.560> has<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.740> pattern<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> consistency

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
rockstar has a pattern and a consistency

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.999 
rockstar has a pattern and a consistency
of<00:01:39.570> uploading<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.619> DLC<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:42.119> GTA<00:01:42.509> 5<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:43.799> or

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
of uploading a DLC to GTA 5 about one or

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.679 
of uploading a DLC to GTA 5 about one or
two<00:01:44.040> times<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.549> month<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.090> really<00:01:45.540> really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
two times a month which is really really

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.780 
two times a month which is really really
good<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> unfortunately<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:47.280> rockstar<00:01:47.759> has

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
good and unfortunately your rockstar has

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.780 
good and unfortunately your rockstar has
actually<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.509> done<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.020> dlc<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.950> gt5<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.610> wine

actually not done a dlc on gt5 of wine

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.789 
actually not done a dlc on gt5 of wine
in<00:01:51.060> nearly<00:01:51.570> two<00:01:51.780> months<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.229> cannot<00:01:52.500> remember

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
in nearly two months I cannot remember

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.289 
in nearly two months I cannot remember
the<00:01:52.979> last<00:01:53.009> time<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.610> rockstar<00:01:53.939> has<00:01:53.970> gone<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the last time the rockstar has gone a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
the last time the rockstar has gone a
full<00:01:54.479> month<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.899> release<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.380> dlc

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
full month of that release in the dlc

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
full month of that release in the dlc
the<00:01:56.549> last<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.060> unfortunately<00:01:57.630> Christmas

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the last one was unfortunately Christmas

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020 
the last one was unfortunately Christmas
you'll<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.920> all<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> new<00:01:59.310> users<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> GTA

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you'll see and all the new users to GTA

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.730 
you'll see and all the new users to GTA
5<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.360> general<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:01.140> actually<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.619> had<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
5 in general have actually not had a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
5 in general have actually not had a
chance<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.430> try<00:02:02.670> any<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.210> New<00:02:03.360> Deal<00:02:03.509> seek

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
chance to try any of the New Deal seek

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
chance to try any of the New Deal seek
sort<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.590> items<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> other<00:02:05.250> things<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
sort of items and other things like that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.399 
sort of items and other things like that
so<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.390> reason<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:06.990> exactly

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
so the reason I think it is exactly

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
so the reason I think it is exactly
februari<00:02:07.979> 24th<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> fact<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.030> Rockstar

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
februari 24th is the fact that Rockstar

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.070 
februari 24th is the fact that Rockstar
again<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> said<00:02:09.929> has<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> pattern<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.099> these

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
again as I said has a pattern of these

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.930 
again as I said has a pattern of these
DLCs<00:02:13.080> on

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
DLCs on

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.570 
DLCs on
Tuesday<00:02:14.330> now<00:02:15.200> today<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.130> second<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.550> last

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
Tuesday now today was the second to last

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.190 
Tuesday now today was the second to last
tuesday<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.120> februari<00:02:17.600> which<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.020> leaves

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
tuesday at februari which just leaves

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.650 
tuesday at februari which just leaves
next<00:02:18.470> tuesday<00:02:18.950> which<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.370> februari<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.060> 24th

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
next tuesday which is februari the 24th

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.750 
next tuesday which is februari the 24th
so<00:02:21.230> that's<00:02:21.440> what<00:02:21.590> leads<00:02:21.770> me<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.220> thinking<00:02:22.550> that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
so that's what leads me to thinking that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.390 
so that's what leads me to thinking that
now<00:02:23.660> another<00:02:23.960> key<00:02:24.260> factor<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.740> me<00:02:24.890> thinking

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
now another key factor to me thinking

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.460 
now another key factor to me thinking
that<00:02:25.430> was<00:02:25.640> Tuesday<00:02:26.000> februari<00:02:26.360> 24th<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
that was Tuesday februari 24th is the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.900 
that was Tuesday februari 24th is the
fact<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.800> Rockstar<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> did<00:02:28.550> not<00:02:28.730> actually

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
fact that Rockstar I did not actually

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.080 
fact that Rockstar I did not actually
upload<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.600> Valentine's<00:02:30.470> Day<00:02:30.740> DLC<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.910> usually

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
come out with a dlc and I feel like a

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.520 
come out with a dlc and I feel like a
lot<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.210> people<00:02:59.480> were<00:02:59.540> hoping<00:02:59.810> they<00:02:59.930> did<00:03:00.110> so

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
lot of people were hoping they did so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.380 
lot of people were hoping they did so
the<00:03:00.890> only<00:03:01.070> good<00:03:01.370> excuse<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.880> rockstar<00:03:02.240> could

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
the only good excuse that rockstar could

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.060 
the only good excuse that rockstar could
actually<00:03:02.720> have<00:03:03.140> at<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.350> point<00:03:03.470> was<00:03:04.040> that

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
actually have at this point was that

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.740 
actually have at this point was that
they<00:03:04.280> were<00:03:04.340> working<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.820> heist<00:03:05.120> because

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
they were working on heist because

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.240 
they were working on heist because
everyone's<00:03:06.140> expectations<00:03:06.770> for<00:03:06.890> Heights<00:03:07.100> are

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
everyone's expectations for Heights are

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.850 
everyone's expectations for Heights are
very<00:03:07.880> very<00:03:08.120> high<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:09.050> think<00:03:09.320> rockstar<00:03:09.710> just

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
very very high and I think rockstar just

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.530 
very very high and I think rockstar just
really<00:03:10.070> wants<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.340> live<00:03:10.520> up<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.120> not

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
really wants to live up to that and not

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.450 
really wants to live up to that and not
let<00:03:11.750> anyone<00:03:11.960> down<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:12.860> that's<00:03:13.010> why<00:03:13.190> they're

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
let anyone down so that's why they're

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.220 
let anyone down so that's why they're
continually<00:03:13.970> delaying<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.960> felt<00:03:15.170> like

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
continually delaying it but I felt like

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.720 
continually delaying it but I felt like
to<00:03:15.350> delete<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.740> quite<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:15.980> bit<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.520> is

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
to delete it quite a bit and this is

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.640 
to delete it quite a bit and this is
honestly<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.450> date<00:03:17.989> that<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.260> think<00:03:18.530> it's

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
honestly the date that I think it's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.040 
honestly the date that I think it's
