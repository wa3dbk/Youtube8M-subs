Twitter there was a downloadable client
and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:30.359> changed<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.810> client<00:00:31.080> twice

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and then they changed the client twice

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.950 
and then they changed the client twice
two<00:00:31.769> different<00:00:32.070> web<00:00:32.160> clients<00:00:32.780> you<00:00:33.780> just

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
two different web clients you just

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.120 
two different web clients you just
really<00:00:34.200> had<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.530> following<00:00:34.800> their<00:00:34.920> Twitter

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
really had to be following their Twitter

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.720 
really had to be following their Twitter
to<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.399> able<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> play<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:37.309> don't<00:00:38.309> even<00:00:38.550> think

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to be able to play I don't even think

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.270 
to be able to play I don't even think
servers<00:00:39.420> pc<00:00:39.989> will<00:00:40.140> handle<00:00:40.350> 1k<00:00:40.649> players<00:00:40.920> yeah

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
servers pc will handle 1k players yeah

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
servers pc will handle 1k players yeah
it<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> stability<00:00:41.879> test<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.629> see<00:00:42.899> how<00:00:43.140> many

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it was a stability test to see how many

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
it was a stability test to see how many
players<00:00:43.530> could<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.920> held<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.340> his<00:00:44.670> computer

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
players could be held on his computer

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.840 
players could be held on his computer
and<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:48.289> I'm<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.469> sure<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:50.100> he<00:00:50.730> was

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and that I'm not sure really what he was

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.279 
and that I'm not sure really what he was
thinking<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:51.390> he<00:00:51.420> did<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
thinking when he did that but with a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.990 
thinking when he did that but with a
dedication<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.129> could<00:00:53.280> probably<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> lot

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
dedication we could probably get a lot

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.330 
dedication we could probably get a lot
more<00:00:54.059> than<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.800> looks<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.100> it's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
more than that so it looks like it's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
more than that so it looks like it's
really<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.789> laggy<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> video<00:00:57.570> but

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
really really laggy in the video but

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
really really laggy in the video but
it's<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:59.250> gonna<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.609> better<00:00:59.820> once<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.180> get

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
it's it's gonna get better once they get

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
it's it's gonna get better once they get
a<00:01:00.359> dedication<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> game<00:01:02.039> gonna<00:01:02.219> be

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
Twitter they took it down because I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.250 
Twitter they took it down because I
