00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.970
 Maa after we got acquainted yesterday 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:12.190
 There was a musical instrument hunt Nea that Tteyuu that more and more Olympic Games 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:18.070
 Hey Well it so much I'm still the 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:20.080
 Until now the Olympics have not been watched, I wonder if it was a judo gold and kane Matsumoto player in judo 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.150
 Or take it or something 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.570
 Well, that's why I saw it, but I was not interested in it any more 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:33.320
 Though 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:36.870
 Well, a little mysterious Indian people got mixed up in the opening ceremony or something 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 What does this mean? The London Olympics 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.560
 I though I had become a little care in softening Well kind of direction to say Ette 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 Something 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 It was the opening of the London Olympic Games that became a major topic of this volume- 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:01:00.650
 Why to either say it's Japanese team 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:04.250
 The players in other countries say that the opening ceremony was just renewed and dealt with as it is 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.900
 The zodiac rug rag simmered side by side 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 Enanka this 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:16.390
 What if the group talked or did something like that but why only the Japanese team? 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.430
 It is said that it was leaving 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.590
 It was the first, that was that 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:29.869
 Well there is a blog of those who live in London really 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:34.399
 1 personal person points out so with changing photo, and with a picture 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.700
 If you are alone in Japanese politics, it may be Marsh individually 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.689
 Four 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.600
 Immediately tomorrow Nangang I Toka What N exchange for tomorrow there is a soccer 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.130
 a 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:50.370
 I wrote that I did not know that there was an emergency or a business event and put it 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:56.850
 Other foreign players who have a match soon 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.260
 Discriminatory things written have but funny Do the Kaboka core say to the side by side on this track 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.070
 Is it all right? 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.730
 Is it related to the au nuclear accident? 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.360
 I was thinking about something there, but 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:19.470
 There are lots of good rooms, though 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 Well this is the Asahi Shimbun, and it was decided that the request from the Japanese side would have been taken off, giving priority to adjustment 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:28.980
 So the theory is that Japan players have left the temple nicely 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.480
 Mark is a child. Is this something a legislator? 4 schools 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:40.519
 It is that that is flowing in water twitter 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:46.540
 Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry that the London Olympic Games is its management I side cat misses and iu 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:52.930
 a softening things like that I was attacked is something sake ioc Is Olympic Committee 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:58.629
 I've seen you tweet, but it's also true that it's shot which is true 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:04.000
 I Japanese athletes is whether that participation It is without participate in bloom 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.060
 It Tteyuu's apparently true like the Tteyuu was directly Okura in if this and comfortably 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.400
 Well 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:16.319
 After 3 days, this problem has grown and I wonder 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:21.930
 It is to say why funny to say that this it is the mass media 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:25.410
 I really I'm I'm everywhere there is a kind of mystery I Tteyuu I wonder if did not write 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.370
 In the opening ceremony 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.330
 This is the place that everyone is excited at that camera degree 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.780
 Let's sing the kana do not Toka refrigeration taking a wonder if not sleep in the Toka photo 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.909
 It doesn't matter, so that 's it 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.849
 If it's a truck, it's kicking and it 's kind of true that it's a big deal 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:50.360
 You say about something like that 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.610
 Something good to say to say that come out I think that funny this something 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:59.960
 Hmm 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:05.970
 Well, that's ... Is this something I thought Oh I Olympic Games operated by the not'm Toka discriminatory treatment 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:11.970
 I think it's one story of Umitsu what Te is also referred to but I'm likely the Indians had slipped 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:17.730
 If so, I think that is a problem then 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:22.630
 It wasn't a mistake. The Japanese team really corresponded to Shoji wonderfully. 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:26.410
 Properly it is anymore that it is as long as the Tteyuu 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:32.590
 Softening Imantoko come I'm want you to their description 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:38.520
 I do not become a Well big topic this so much if Re only is it small high small net 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.520
 I think the Gachotto something Do's inexplicable say 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:45.340
 Well I am not at the moment 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.480
 Just because you don't know well 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.210
 I can not say anything but I want you to explain me 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.350
 Olympics and the Japanese side 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:59.100
 [musics] 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:01.760
 So I think that such a public may really develop into an international issue 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.760
 Though
