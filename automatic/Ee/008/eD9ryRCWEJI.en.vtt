00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.390
 ah 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.110
 a surprise first that bbm 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.450
 globomedia and telecinco offered me the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.669
 paper and from there I read the script 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.439
 and I thought it was great, then 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.990
 because I was going to work with an actor is 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.539
 the level of nativity scene with directors very 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.790
 good and good with a whole team what 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 I was going to do a project, so what 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.090
 is what is doing one thing 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.010
 fantastic and good here I am 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.010
 live work on television 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.260
 and another that I'm more or less happy and 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.370
 I hope you like it as I like it 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.050
 the experience that is amazing 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.579
 I represent RubÃ©n Barahona is an actor 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.039
 that things are going very well 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.089
 both in Spain and outside of Spain 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.289
 start doing projects 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.500
 very recognized international and good 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.560
 but still having a very life 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.360
 Quiet loves to live in the neighborhood 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.700
 that there was of all life to see their 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.689
 friends 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.689
 It is very familiar 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.590
 He travels constantly and well, there is his 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.870
 life has changed since making a better 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.430
 I have been unemployed for years and can not do Christmas 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.950
 because as the one who was wearing can not leave 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.050
 of cane with colleagues can not go to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180
 play tennis at the municipal track not 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.100
 you can bathe in the pool of your town 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.350
 because of his neighborhood because he is 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.350
 harassed by the paparazzi and that then 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.050
 it prevents him a little from leading that life that 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.140
 offer 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.900
 a story with a candle at the beginning what 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.130
 better if you think about it because we do not like 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 they are very good with the media says 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.750
 move again another report like that of 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.610
 always or advancing again the same and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.780
 when they offer him, then, he candela 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.650
 I had known for some time 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.650
 institute and followed 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.380
 he says yes and good they do the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.360
 24 hours report with a first value 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.450
 at first maybe yes 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.920
 have an actress of the caliber of nativity scene 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.880
 Well the best yes but I think it is 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.700
 It makes everything easier as everything was 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.590
 as more fluid good to have a person 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.510
 and he has been working in the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.000
 world of cinema television because that 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.680
 the two easiest good especially the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.069
 name rhythm 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.250
 record in movies because if you have two months 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.370
 to record a movie here and better 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.670
 you have a week to do the same 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.670
 work 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.200
 you take it and the quick one is already but it's 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.599
 all right 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.620
 I have to do it again over all the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.140
 rhythm too 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.360
 when you come from outside you see that they are all one 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.030
 pineapple are a whole family that carry a 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.250
 lots of months together and coming out 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.780
 better it's a little bit harder to cross 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.460
 that line 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.590
 it was a bit more difficult at the time of 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.060
 record but good is that they all put 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.740
 an incredible desire of the project of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.780
 get ahead and they infect you that 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.520
 energy and you say come on let's do 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.730
 the best possible because I had 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.730
 four years and one year before shooting end 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.610
 It has spent years with the fly behind 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.810
 ear and with Antonio we were talking 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.810
 when you're ready, tell me 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.099
 I said now I'm sad because I said 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.709
 I'm more in Europe I was calmer 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.030
 I saw it more clearly I did not have so many fears 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.379
 they are all changes things the head 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.379
 I think it's just what you do
