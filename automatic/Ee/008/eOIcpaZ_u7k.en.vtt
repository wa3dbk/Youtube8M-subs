be<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.070> stoppage<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.700> this<00:05:13.850> vise<00:05:14.060> fight<00:05:14.570> because

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
be a stoppage in this vise fight because

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.110 
be a stoppage in this vise fight because
both<00:05:15.020> guys<00:05:15.260> are<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:15.890> tough<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.430> they're<00:05:16.850> both

so<00:05:17.480> skilled<00:05:17.900> but<00:05:18.470> i<00:05:18.500> think<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.280> the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
so skilled but i think that the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.550 
so skilled but i think that the
advantage<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.030> Robbie<00:05:20.660> Lawler<00:05:20.900> has<00:05:21.140> is<00:05:21.410> he

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
advantage that Robbie Lawler has is he

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.140 
advantage that Robbie Lawler has is he
gets<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.920> kind<00:05:22.100> of<00:05:22.220> mend<00:05:22.430> some<00:05:22.760> of<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:22.940> things

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
gets to kind of mend some of the things

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.300 
gets to kind of mend some of the things
that<00:05:23.390> didn't<00:05:23.930> work<00:05:24.080> in<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.680> first<00:05:24.710> fight<00:05:25.160> he

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
that didn't work in that first fight he

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.040 
that didn't work in that first fight he
mentioned<00:05:25.640> that<00:05:25.670> he<00:05:25.760> wasn't<00:05:26.090> as<00:05:26.360> aggressive

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050
