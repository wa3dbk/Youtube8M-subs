00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
systems or use rack now gear so it's got

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.560 
systems or use rack now gear so it's got
a<00:00:59.370> fully<00:00:59.609> buffer<00:00:59.940> tube<00:01:00.149> loop<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.539> back

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
a fully buffer tube loop in the back
