00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.630 
planets but really it comes down to it
was<00:02:46.320> like<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> first<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.070> know<00:02:47.160> buddy<00:02:47.400> cop

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
was like the first you know buddy cop

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520 
was like the first you know buddy cop
you<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:48.180> series<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.780> Kirk<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.500> Spock

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you know series and Kirk and Spock

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.950 
you know series and Kirk and Spock
really<00:02:50.190> are<00:02:50.400> two<00:02:51.030> halves<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.540> same<00:02:51.690> sort

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
really are two halves of the same sort

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.690 
really are two halves of the same sort
of<00:02:52.050> personality<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.160> when<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.370> look<00:02:53.520> at<00:02:53.610> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
of personality so when you look at it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.010 
of personality so when you look at it
like<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.120> was<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.240> no-brainer<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:54.900> got

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
like that it was a no-brainer if we got

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.080 
like that it was a no-brainer if we got
to<00:02:55.110> make<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> co-op<00:02:55.590> game<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.730> know<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.880> get

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
to make a co-op game so you know you get

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.310 
to make a co-op game so you know you get
to<00:02:57.150> play<00:02:57.270> his<00:02:57.420> Kirk<00:02:57.660> it's<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.960> completely

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
to play his Kirk it's a completely

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.500 
to play his Kirk it's a completely
different<00:02:58.770> sort<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.460> know<00:02:59.490> set<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.270> skills

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
different sort of you know set of skills

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
different sort of you know set of skills
he<00:03:00.750> has<00:03:00.780> he's<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> brawler<00:03:01.620> he's<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> fighter

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
he has he's a brawler he's a fighter

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.190 
he has he's a brawler he's a fighter
once<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.760> dive<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.210> response<00:03:03.930> more

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
once it's just dive in response more

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.020 
once it's just dive in response more
logical<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.980> he<00:03:05.040> gets<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.280> do<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> neck<00:03:05.760> pinch

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
logical and he gets to do a neck pinch

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.760 
logical and he gets to do a neck pinch
in<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.840> know<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.080> mind<00:03:07.260> melds<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.680> you

can<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.250> demo<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.600> that's

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
can see in the demo and you know that's

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.240 
can see in the demo and you know that's
where<00:03:09.990> really<00:03:10.230> where<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> game<00:03:10.710> comes<00:03:11.010> from

your characters to be able to you know

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.170 
your characters to be able to you know
to<00:03:43.320> grow<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.860> way<00:03:44.010> but<00:03:44.459> also<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.030> could

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
to grow that way but also it you could

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.670 
to grow that way but also it you could
also<00:03:45.300> use<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.750> combat<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.170> think<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.530> saw

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
also use it for combat I think you saw

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.620 
also use it for combat I think you saw
in<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.800> demo<00:03:47.010> they<00:03:47.640> sort<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:47.940> gets<00:03:48.090> her<00:03:48.209> our

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
in the demo they sort of gets her our

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.090 
in the demo they sort of gets her our
heroes<00:03:48.959> get<00:03:49.110> surrounded<00:03:49.560> by<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.800> Gorn

heroes get surrounded by the Gorn

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.830 
heroes get surrounded by the Gorn
there's<00:03:50.340> no<00:03:50.489> way<00:03:50.640> out<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.150> Kirk<00:03:51.510> actually

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
there's no way out and Kirk actually

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.940 
there's no way out and Kirk actually
calls<00:03:52.050> it<00:03:52.230> an<00:03:52.320> air<00:03:52.470> strike<00:03:52.709> from<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
calls it an air strike from the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.170 
calls it an air strike from the
enterprise<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.520> sort<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.760> bail<00:03:53.880> them<00:03:54.060> out<00:03:54.120> of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
enterprise to sort of bail them out of

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.820 
enterprise to sort of bail them out of
that<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.690> they're<00:03:55.140> gonna<00:03:55.230> be<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.380> lot<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.560> cool

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
that so they're gonna be a lot of cool

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.440 
that so they're gonna be a lot of cool
like<00:03:56.040> really<00:03:56.400> giant<00:03:56.790> air<00:03:56.910> strikes<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.420> that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
like really giant air strikes like that

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.420 
like really giant air strikes like that
how<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.230> how<00:03:58.470> else<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.860> enterprise<00:03:59.250> gonna

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
how is how else is the enterprise gonna

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.770 
how is how else is the enterprise gonna
be<00:03:59.550> involved<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.910> olin<00:04:00.120> well<00:04:00.390> we<00:04:00.480> think<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
be involved in olin well we think the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.390 
be involved in olin well we think the
enterprise<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.320> character<00:04:01.770> you<00:04:01.950> know<00:04:01.980> Star

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
enterprise is a character you know Star

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.699 
enterprise is a character you know Star
Trek<00:04:02.640> isn't<00:04:03.600> Star<00:04:03.870> Trek<00:04:04.050> without<00:04:04.320> our<00:04:04.470> great

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
Trek isn't Star Trek without our great

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.190 
Trek isn't Star Trek without our great
ship<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:05.489> we<00:04:06.060> wanted<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> go<00:04:06.690> about<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:06.959> in

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
ship and so we wanted to go about it in

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.570 
ship and so we wanted to go about it in
two<00:04:07.380> ways<00:04:07.560> how<00:04:07.950> do<00:04:08.010> we<00:04:08.160> make<00:04:08.310> sure<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.550> looks

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
two ways how do we make sure it looks

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.210 
two ways how do we make sure it looks
exactly<00:04:09.360> right<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.320> know<00:04:10.440> she<00:04:10.500> she<00:04:11.070> has<00:04:11.190> a

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
exactly right you know she she has a

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.800 
exactly right you know she she has a
very<00:04:11.400> distinct<00:04:11.880> look<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.270> film<00:04:12.450> so

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
very distinct look in the film so

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.780 
very distinct look in the film so
