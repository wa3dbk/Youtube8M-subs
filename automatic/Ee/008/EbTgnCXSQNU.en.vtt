kerrigan temple sewers and warehouse and
by<00:01:46.049> far<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.619> most<00:01:46.710> popular<00:01:47.159> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

by far I think the most popular is
Kerrigan<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.420> warehouse<00:01:49.259> where<00:01:49.829> else<00:01:49.979> is
