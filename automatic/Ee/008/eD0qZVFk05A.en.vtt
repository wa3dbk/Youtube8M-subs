00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello and there is your cold porcelain if still 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.090
 you have not done it here I leave you the recipe 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.189
 If you already did it but you still do not know how 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.290
 give you color in this video I'm going to 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.420
 show three different ways to give 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.160
 color so you can start to perform 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.840
 your figures 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.150
 there are many pigments with which 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.530
 you can color the porcelain my 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 favorites are three oil paintings 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.420
 acrylic paintings 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 and in makeup 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.420
 the oil paintings are my paintings 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 favorites since they offer us a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.570
 Stronger color in dark colors 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.360
 like black coffee and red is preferable 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.010
 paint them with this type of paint and 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.890
 that with little quantity will offer us 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.900
 the color that we want for 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.270
 painting the porcelain basically you have to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.400
 put a quantity of color and start 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.130
 knead very well so that we stay 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.380
 uniform the color if necessary you must 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.050
 put a little more to get to the color 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.960
 that you want the only thing you should take 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.280
 in account is to dry your figure the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 color will increase a little more 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.570
 the acrylic paints also 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.100
 they serve to color the porcelain 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.229
 only that unlike the paintings of 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.270
 oil this will not be useful for us 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.490
 paint dark colors since the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.409
 pigment that they have is not as strong and 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.810
 we would need a lot of 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.450
 paint to get the color that 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.280
 we want the acrylic paint also we 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.530
 It serves to give details to our 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.530
 figures so take it into account 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.040
 do not 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.650
 makeup I only use it when I go to 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.030
 paint small quantities and to have 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.030
 finished the figures 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.300
 and you 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.120
 d 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.950

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.400
