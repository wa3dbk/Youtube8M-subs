00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.640
 inside harmony so we take you away 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.049
 because tonia cartolaria live 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.030
 from the island of the lily can show us 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.349
 exclusive images of the interiors 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.509
 of the ship one and a half years from 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.290
 sinking as they continue day and 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.790
 night 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.330
 work for a full float 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.189
 both dark and tonia are images 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.650
 impressive and undoubtedly this 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.539
 adjective cannot be wrong 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 impress to see the interior of the coast 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.529
 concord among other things are of the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.289
 absolutely exclusive images are the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.120
 first images after the housing rig 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.860
 of the wreck what we see are 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 places that evidently have been 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.020
 quickly abandoned by passengers 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.660
 of the Costa Concordia after the sinking 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.870
 come here along the coasts of the island of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.510
 lily on January 13, 2012 shipwreck 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.379
 which unfortunately cost 32 lives 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.449
 people and later even to a suv a 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.829
 sub of the titan group a mycomei one of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.559
 those men among other things boy 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.750
 very young who worked here in the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.149
 construction of the Costa Concordia is for 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.820
 this we can certainly say 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 that the victims of the shipwreck the victims 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 of this incident of this tragedy 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 there are 33 32 those of the shipwreck more 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.380
 this guy is by the way 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 we still remember it never was 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.740
 the body of russell rebello e 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.390
 searches will start again as soon as it is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.009
 possible as the boss himself said 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.259
 of civil protection Franco Gabrielli 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.310
 these images that we continue to see 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.280
 they are really exclusive images 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.710
 tell the corridors this you see are 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.750
 the windows facing the sea 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.430
 then open to the left side 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.250
 of the of the ship that currently 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.350
 moved 30 meters right towards 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 the sea we see the stairs i 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.500
 bar restaurants statues chairs are 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.530
 places where people were 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 and then she ran away abandoned in a hurry 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 there is no way to try to find salvation 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.750
 They have made it in 32 other passengers 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.400
 thankfully they are saved with 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.100
 all the history we know of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.869
 health that some have been dropped 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.520
 they got stuck on the ship they plan 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.959
 floor tilted to one side and that 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.630
 did not allow people to be able 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.010
 reach points and places where 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.690
 to be able to find salvation are images 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.580
 extraordinary are you see images 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.780
 illuminated by sunlight e 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.600
 above all we see these stairways 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 these rather among others also in 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.010
 order not in disarray we say of 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.610
 one of a shipwreck so when it was 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.560
 straightened and then when he started the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.820
 housing rig evidently has been 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.110
 also a little settled inside because 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.820
 they would never have been told in 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.980
 these positions for example the chairs 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.410
 which are who they are standing that they are 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.510
 straight in short, the first images 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.230
 images of the interior of the coast 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.269
 concord 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.549
 after the pre-buoyancy phase that 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.070
 the one we are currently in 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.580
 today and tomorrow will be fixed i 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.970
 boxes on the starboard side ie they will come 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.040
 lowered 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.900
 because it was not possible to do it up 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.630
 now since there was a forgery 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.239
 the vessel is now at the bottom and towards the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.030
 open sea and therefore there is space for 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.880
 to be able to arrange them as planned 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.310
 project and then continue with the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.420
 the third phase of the buoyancy 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.320
 real to get 14 meters in 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.420
 total emergence of the keel 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.870
 it will remain below for around 18 meters 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.360
 18 and a half meters which is the draft col 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.640
 which ship goes and will sail to 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.310
 Genoa port to be demolished for 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.470
 be dismantled knicks the Hon 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.549
 and on the coast also concord 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.320
 this morning for this third day 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.569
 he interviewed him before that 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.140
 climbed aboard Alexandra of the world ve 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.140
 we make it heard
