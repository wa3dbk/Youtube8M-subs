a<00:00:37.220> game<00:00:37.400> in<00:00:37.430> there<00:00:37.730> but<00:00:37.880> they<00:00:37.940> do<00:00:38.060> come<00:00:38.090> on<00:00:38.390> a

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
a game in there but they do come on a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.000 
a game in there but they do come on a
standard<00:00:39.140> like<00:00:39.739> CDs<00:00:40.220> I<00:00:40.460> guess<00:00:41.680> let's<00:00:42.680> close

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
standard like CDs I guess let's close

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.750 
standard like CDs I guess let's close
that<00:00:43.660> now<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:45.050> one<00:00:45.260> here<00:00:45.440> I<00:00:45.649> don't<00:00:46.309> think<00:00:46.640> it

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
that now this one here I don't think it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.790 
that now this one here I don't think it
works<00:00:47.000> anymore<00:00:47.300> I<00:00:47.750> have<00:00:48.050> tried<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.410> few<00:00:48.620> games

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
works anymore I have tried a few games

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.639 
works anymore I have tried a few games
on<00:00:49.040> it<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:49.670> doesn't<00:00:50.059> work<00:00:50.440> but<00:00:51.440> that's

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
on it and it doesn't work but that's

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.889 
on it and it doesn't work but that's
because<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.340> very<00:00:52.370> old<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.180> one<00:00:53.390> believed

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
because it is very old this one believed

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.810 
because it is very old this one believed
was<00:00:54.170> made<00:00:54.350> in<00:00:54.500> 1996<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:55.640> is<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:56.000> model<00:00:56.660> 1<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.820> if

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
was made in 1996 it is a model 1 and if

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.959 
was made in 1996 it is a model 1 and if
you<00:00:58.910> look<00:00:59.030> on<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.210> back<00:00:59.329> here<00:00:59.390> his<00:01:00.079> feet<00:01:00.379> AC<00:01:01.340> in

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
on the sides there is more events and

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.260 
on the sides there is more events and
more<00:01:31.009> events<00:01:31.700> again<00:01:32.829> sent<00:01:33.829> over<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.700> frontier

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
more events again sent over the frontier

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.839 
more events again sent over the frontier
there's<00:01:35.509> two<00:01:35.749> controller<00:01:36.200> ports<00:01:36.649> but<00:01:37.520> there

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
there's two controller ports but there

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:42.989 
there's two controller ports but there
is<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> multi-tap<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.209> is<00:01:41.299> right<00:01:41.329> here

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
is a multi-tap and here it is right here

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.599 
is a multi-tap and here it is right here
here<00:01:43.999> is<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.359> multi-tap<00:01:44.899> fit<00:01:45.529> to<00:01:45.889> sony<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.279> and

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
here is the multi-tap fit to sony on and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.909 
here is the multi-tap fit to sony on and
you<00:01:46.909> can<00:01:47.060> plug<00:01:47.209> in<00:01:47.359> 4<00:01:47.630> controllers<00:01:48.560> i<00:01:48.740> think

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:48.919 
you can plug in 4 controllers i think

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:53.169 
you can plug in 4 controllers i think
five<00:01:49.219> including<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:50.090> one<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:50.389> the<00:01:50.479> ps1<00:01:51.459> so<00:01:52.459> now

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
five including the one on the ps1 so now

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.599 
five including the one on the ps1 so now
i'm<00:01:53.329> going<00:01:53.389> to<00:01:53.539> go<00:01:53.630> over<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.869> controllers<00:01:54.609> by

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
i'm going to go over the controllers by

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:01.440 
i'm going to go over the controllers by
the<00:01:55.999> way<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.069> here<00:01:58.069> is<00:01:58.099> the<00:01:59.200> ps1<00:02:00.200> controller

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
the way so here is the ps1 controller

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.639 
the way so here is the ps1 controller
now<00:02:02.450> there<00:02:02.779> was<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.959> few<00:02:03.259> different

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
now there was a few different

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.399 
now there was a few different
controllers<00:02:04.279> for<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.239> you<00:02:05.389> can<00:02:05.539> see<00:02:05.749> now

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
controllers for it and you can see now

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.139 
controllers for it and you can see now
this<00:02:06.590> one<00:02:06.739> was<00:02:06.859> an<00:02:06.979> amazing<00:02:07.669> controller

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
this one was an amazing controller

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.480 
this one was an amazing controller
probably<00:02:08.509> my<00:02:08.770> second<00:02:09.770> favorite<00:02:10.130> controller

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
probably my second favorite controller

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.330 
probably my second favorite controller
of<00:02:10.670> all<00:02:10.729> time<00:02:11.200> as<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.320> can<00:02:12.410> see<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.100> very

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
of all time as you can see it is very

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.800 
of all time as you can see it is very
basic<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.300> does<00:02:14.510> not

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
basic it does not

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.809 
basic it does not
have<00:02:14.930> any<00:02:15.080> thumbsticks<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.400> d-pad<00:02:16.760> and

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
have any thumbsticks just a d-pad and

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.250 
have any thumbsticks just a d-pad and
some<00:02:17.420> buttons<00:02:18.130> also<00:02:19.130> these<00:02:19.220> two<00:02:19.430> buttons<00:02:19.610> here

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
some buttons also these two buttons here

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.190 
some buttons also these two buttons here
but<00:02:21.260> then<00:02:21.470> Sonia<00:02:22.280> had<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.610> great<00:02:22.910> idea<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.510> it's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
but then Sonia had a great idea and it's

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.330 
but then Sonia had a great idea and it's
added<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> release<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:25.310> one<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.510> DualShock

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
added to release this one the DualShock

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.620 
added to release this one the DualShock
now<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.790> difference<00:02:29.090> between<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.390> one<00:02:29.569> and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
now the difference between this one and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.470 
now the difference between this one and
this<00:02:30.530> one<00:02:30.590> are<00:02:30.950> fairly<00:02:31.459> obvious<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:32.360> is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
this one are fairly obvious this one is

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.530 
this one are fairly obvious this one is
to<00:02:32.599> thumb<00:02:32.840> sticks<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.410> an<00:02:34.010> analog<00:02:34.340> button<00:02:34.730> but

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
to thumb sticks and an analog button but

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.250 
to thumb sticks and an analog button but
that's<00:02:36.110> what<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> only<00:02:36.680> difference<00:02:37.130> also

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
that's what the only difference also

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.500 
that's what the only difference also
these<00:02:39.260> buttons<00:02:39.650> are<00:02:39.769> bigger<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.370> l2<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.450> r2

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
these buttons are bigger the l2 and r2

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.199 
these buttons are bigger the l2 and r2
buttons<00:02:42.080> are<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.560> fair<00:02:42.800> bit<00:02:42.920> bigger<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.459> if<00:02:44.120> you

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
buttons are a fair bit bigger and if you

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.530 
buttons are a fair bit bigger and if you
see<00:02:44.360> here<00:02:44.569> here's<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.840> PS<00:02:45.200> 34<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.099> hasn't<00:02:46.910> done

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
see here here's a PS 34 it hasn't done

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.840 
see here here's a PS 34 it hasn't done
anything<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.620> controller<00:02:48.980> hasn't<00:02:49.340> evolved

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
anything the controller hasn't evolved

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.280 
anything the controller hasn't evolved
since<00:02:50.720> about<00:02:51.290> nineteen<00:02:51.680> ninety-six<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.510> yes
