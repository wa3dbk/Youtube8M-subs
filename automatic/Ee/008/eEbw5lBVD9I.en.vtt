00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 an 18-year-old British girl 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.639
 He goes to hospital after 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.710
 consumed liquid nitrogen and takes away 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.590
 in the stomach in full 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.040
 a somewhat scandalous news that 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.400
 it happened in truth and that is not the first 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.740
 person without stomach the curious thing about 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.790
 liquid nitrogen that this woman ingested 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.189
 is that if it has not evaporated 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.980
 completely because it can damage 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.200
 irreversibly the stomach of 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.660
 done if it had not been taken away 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.870
 stomach one hundred percent this person 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.600
 he would have died had he been drilled 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.910
 completely the stomach can live 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.460
 no stomach clear that you can live 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 without stomach all you have to do 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.850
 is to bypass the esophagus and the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.089
 small intestine you have to join both 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.519
 ends of course that person no longer 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:06.000
 you can eat slow-digesting things 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:09.070
 like me who flours like fats 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.990
 beef steaks for example goes to 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.010
 have to eat throughout his life 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.800
 food that is digested 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.940
 in a faster way than usual 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.440
 and that can be chewed and crushed 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.390
 properly to let it pass 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.760
 practically turned into mush this 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.100
 person will be fed at the moment by 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.050
 intravenously will put in the blood the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.930
 nutrients needed for it to continue 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.690
 living will be waiting until it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.390
 find a stomach donor and if not 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.979
 none is found in that case and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.310
 in that case what should be done 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.630
 would bind the exo phage with the intestine 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.869
 thin 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.479
 she has to feel lucky to have 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.670
 survived this incident is true 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.610
 that today many companies in 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.329
 many bars are starting to use 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.399
 the liquid nitrogen to freeze 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.580
 instantaneously alcohol and water 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.349
 to create ice cubes but if not 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.840
 let yourself wait long enough 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.870
 for all nitrogen evaporate 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.909
 liquid 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.390
 you can take the risk that if you 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:25.060
 do you ingest the entire device 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.129
 digestive there was luck only 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.650
 pierced the stomach only only 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.629
 they removed the is the stomach and in the case 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.629
 that this person had spread 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.000
 an interesting video would have died 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.379
 because it teaches you that it really 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.659
 You can live without stomach and also you 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.269
 teaches that liquid nitrogen is very 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.970
 dangerous let's say it's about 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.750
 temperatures of less than 200 degrees 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.319
 centigrade so it's not suitable for 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.319
 human consumption
