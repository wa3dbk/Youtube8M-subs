00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
you guys say batteries what the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.219 
you guys say batteries what the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.510 
the exposure coming out okay so I'm
going<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.040> kind<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.369> pan<00:01:49.150> up<00:01:49.860> pan<00:01:50.860> down<00:01:51.100> with<00:01:51.369> me

is it's on a hundred percent the other
thing<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.670> schools<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.060> gives<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.360> a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
thing that schools that gives you a

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.290 
thing that schools that gives you a
digital<00:02:05.810> readout<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.409> really<00:02:07.070> like<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.460> so

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
digital readout I really like that so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.660 
digital readout I really like that so
I'm<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.350> go<00:02:09.440> all<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.679> way<00:02:09.740> back<00:02:09.979> here

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.860 

how<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.820> she<00:02:13.940> coming<00:02:14.240> out<00:02:15.400> okay<00:02:16.430> choice<00:02:17.030> choice

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
how is she coming out okay choice choice

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.290 
how is she coming out okay choice choice
is<00:02:18.050> currently<00:02:18.440> I'd<00:02:18.680> say<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:19.910> full<00:02:20.120> power

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
is currently I'd say is on full power

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.550 
is currently I'd say is on full power
she's<00:02:21.070> what<00:02:22.070> 15<00:02:22.310> feet<00:02:22.760> from<00:02:22.910> me<00:02:23.350> go<00:02:24.350> all<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
she's what 15 feet from me go all the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.360 
she's what 15 feet from me go all the
way<00:02:24.590> back<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:27.620> should<00:02:27.650> have<00:02:27.830> put<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.040> zoom<00:02:28.220> on

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
way back we should have put a zoom on

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.390 
way back we should have put a zoom on
for<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.760> that's<00:02:29.270> good<00:02:29.450> right<00:02:29.630> there

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
for this that's good right there

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.880 
for this that's good right there
how's<00:02:31.400> she<00:02:31.550> coming<00:02:31.700> out<00:02:32.500> okay

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
how's she coming out okay

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.500 
how's she coming out okay
come<00:02:34.310> forward<00:02:35.890> how<00:02:36.890> about<00:02:37.070> right<00:02:37.190> there<00:02:37.510> okay

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
come forward how about right there okay

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.270 
come forward how about right there okay
so<00:02:39.200> that's<00:02:39.380> good<00:02:39.560> that's<00:02:39.739> probably<00:02:39.860> about<00:02:40.070> the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
so that's good that's probably about the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.820 
so that's good that's probably about the
limit<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:40.910> here<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.959> are<00:02:41.989> it's<00:02:42.350> darkness

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
limit and so here we are it's darkness

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.130 
limit and so here we are it's darkness
around<00:02:42.980> us<00:02:43.340> there's<00:02:44.060> no<00:02:44.330> other<00:02:44.480> ambient<00:02:44.900> light

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
around us there's no other ambient light

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.110 
around us there's no other ambient light

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
it looks like without the light on see

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.580 
it looks like without the light on see
how<00:02:50.900> dark<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.260> is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
how dark it is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.590 
how dark it is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.360 

the<00:03:00.620> point<00:03:00.799> son<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:03.250> know<00:03:04.250> as

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
the point son is that you know as

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.050 
the point son is that you know as
photographers<00:03:05.060> were<00:03:05.239> always<00:03:06.700> it's<00:03:07.700> one<00:03:07.910> thing

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
photographers were always it's one thing

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.210 
photographers were always it's one thing
to<00:03:08.120> read<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.390> lumens<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.290> everything<00:03:09.680> else<00:03:09.860> but

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
to read a lumens and everything else but

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.390 
to read a lumens and everything else but
if<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:12.170> photographer's<00:03:12.709> watching<00:03:13.130> this<00:03:13.220> or

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
if the photographer's watching this or

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.979 
if the photographer's watching this or
anything<00:03:13.549> like<00:03:13.820> me<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.620> just<00:03:15.620> want<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.950> see

anything like me I just want to see

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.150 
anything like me I just want to see
we're<00:03:17.989> not<00:03:18.110> scientists<00:03:18.620> were<00:03:18.860> photographers

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
we're not scientists were photographers

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.150 
we're not scientists were photographers
we<00:03:19.730> want<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.000> see<00:03:20.150> what<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.390> looks<00:03:20.540> like

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
we want to see what it looks like

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.550 
we want to see what it looks like
so<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.700> NiO<00:03:22.940> takes<00:03:23.209> six<00:03:23.450> batteries<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:24.380> all

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
so the NiO takes six batteries are all

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.069 
so the NiO takes six batteries are all
48<00:03:24.860> takes<00:03:25.160> three<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.540> can<00:03:26.720> already<00:03:26.870> tell

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
48 takes three so you can already tell

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.050 
48 takes three so you can already tell
it's<00:03:27.140> going<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.530> be<00:03:27.620> more<00:03:27.799> power<00:03:28.040> based<00:03:28.730> on<00:03:28.940> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
it's going to be more power based on the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.020 
it's going to be more power based on the
batteries<00:03:29.450> alone<00:03:33.760> turn<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> rota<00:03:35.150> light

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
batteries alone turn on the rota light

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
batteries alone turn on the rota light
you<00:03:36.690> ready<00:03:36.900> turn<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.800> light<00:03:37.980> off<00:03:39.560> Wow

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
you ready turn that light off Wow

now

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.100 
now
I<00:04:39.280> was<00:04:40.280> trying<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.580> mimic<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.000> let's<00:04:41.210> see<00:04:41.450> is<00:04:42.050> it

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
I was trying to mimic it let's see is it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.010 
I was trying to mimic it let's see is it
curious<00:04:42.590> now<00:04:42.770> turn<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.190> light<00:04:43.370> down<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:44.020> am

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
curious now turn that light down I am

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.370 
curious now turn that light down I am
going<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.620> adjust<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.520> dimmer<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:47.320> try<00:04:48.320> to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
going to adjust the dimmer to try to

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.060 
going to adjust the dimmer to try to
mimic<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:50.390> light<00:04:50.600> output<00:04:50.780> now<00:04:51.710> we've<00:04:51.860> really

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
mimic the light output now we've really

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.290 
mimic the light output now we've really
meshed<00:04:52.280> up<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.580> color<00:04:52.760> temperature<00:04:53.440> so

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
meshed up the color temperature so

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.180 
meshed up the color temperature so
that's<00:04:56.300> Joyce<00:04:56.800> full<00:04:57.800> power

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
that's Joyce full power

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.000 
that's Joyce full power
ro<00:04:58.520> 48<00:05:00.580> that's<00:05:01.580> what<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.940> neo<00:05:02.150> it's<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.860> much

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
ro 48 that's what the neo it's so much

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.610 
ro 48 that's what the neo it's so much
of<00:05:04.040> a<00:05:04.250> richer<00:05:04.610> light<00:05:04.850> it's<00:05:05.120> deeper<00:05:05.600> it<00:05:06.410> has<00:05:06.590> a

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
of a richer light it's deeper it has a

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.750 
of a richer light it's deeper it has a
much<00:05:06.890> stronger<00:05:07.669> much<00:05:08.300> better<00:05:08.600> throw<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.760> mean

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
much stronger much better throw I mean

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.090 
much stronger much better throw I mean
it's<00:05:11.060> just<00:05:11.530> significant<00:05:12.530> lights<00:05:12.770> up<00:05:12.980> this

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
it's just significant lights up this

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.810 
it's just significant lights up this
whole<00:05:13.310> chamber

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
whole chamber

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.700 
whole chamber
this<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.450> dim<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.810> could<00:05:15.020> not<00:05:15.200> shoot<00:05:15.440> with

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
this is dim you could not shoot with

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.680 
this is dim you could not shoot with
this<00:05:15.919> unless<00:05:16.640> you<00:05:16.820> added<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.150> second<00:05:17.510> bit

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
this unless you added a second bit

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.140 
this unless you added a second bit
rhodolite<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.919> really<00:05:19.100> couldn't<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:19.880> you

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
rhodolite you really couldn't this you

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.790 
rhodolite you really couldn't this you
can<00:05:20.270> shoot<00:05:20.360> with<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.570> one<00:05:20.720> kneel<00:05:20.960> no<00:05:21.320> problem

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
can shoot with the one kneel no problem

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.370 
can shoot with the one kneel no problem
so<00:05:22.580> let<00:05:22.970> me<00:05:23.060> try<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.300> see<00:05:23.630> where<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.169> light

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
so let me try to see where the light

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:35.450 
so let me try to see where the light
output<00:05:24.590> would<00:05:24.980> be<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:27.380> i<00:05:27.440> guess<00:05:27.740> say<00:05:28.610> 25%

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.700 

that's<00:05:36.000> about<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:37.669> about<00:05:38.669> 25%<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.560> light

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
that's about it about 25% so the light

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.460 
that's about it about 25% so the light
output<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.759> RL<00:05:42.570> 48<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.050> interview<00:05:43.290> kit

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
output of the RL 48 the interview kit

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.580 
output of the RL 48 the interview kit
seems<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.889> be<00:05:44.009> about<00:05:44.300> 25%<00:05:45.300> of<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.780> Neo<00:05:45.930> because

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
seems to be about 25% of the Neo because

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.529 
seems to be about 25% of the Neo because
when<00:05:46.710> we<00:05:46.830> possess<00:05:47.250> this<00:05:47.400> guy<00:05:47.610> down<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:48.030> 25%

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
when we possess this guy down to 25%

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.600 
when we possess this guy down to 25%
it's<00:05:49.350> about<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.620> same<00:05:49.770> output<00:05:50.220> so<00:05:50.340> that<00:05:50.460> kind

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
it's about the same output so that kind

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.070 
it's about the same output so that kind
of<00:05:50.639> gives<00:05:50.789> you<00:05:50.850> an<00:05:50.940> idea<00:05:51.000> you<00:05:51.780> really<00:05:51.960> get

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
of gives you an idea you really get

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.659 
of gives you an idea you really get
about<00:05:52.289> four<00:05:52.500> times<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.860> output<00:05:53.160> on<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.370> Neos

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
about four times the output on the Neos

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.870 
about four times the output on the Neos
I<00:05:53.820> mean<00:05:53.940> there<00:05:54.060> are<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.210> ton<00:05:54.570> of<00:05:55.430> more<00:05:56.430> lights<00:05:56.699> in

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
I mean there are a ton of more lights in

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.550 
I mean there are a ton of more lights in
it<00:05:57.030> so<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.210> makes<00:05:57.360> sense<00:05:57.630> but<00:05:57.900> just<00:05:57.960> to<00:05:58.289> let<00:05:58.440> you

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
it so it makes sense but just to let you

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.469 
it so it makes sense but just to let you
guys<00:05:58.710> know<00:05:59.070> it's<00:05:59.729> not<00:05:59.880> just<00:06:00.150> window<00:06:00.449> dressing

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
guys know it's not just window dressing

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.409 
guys know it's not just window dressing
this<00:06:01.050> stuff<00:06:01.320> this<00:06:02.009> is<00:06:02.190> a<00:06:02.220> powerful<00:06:02.580> light<00:06:02.880> so<00:06:03.210> I

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
this stuff this is a powerful light so I

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.749 
this stuff this is a powerful light so I
love<00:06:04.169> these<00:06:04.350> things<00:06:04.590> and<00:06:04.860> rota<00:06:05.400> lights<00:06:05.580> been
