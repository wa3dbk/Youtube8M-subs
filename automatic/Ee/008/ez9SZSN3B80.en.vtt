a book on going postal

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.520 
a book on going postal
it<00:00:48.590> was<00:00:48.680> about<00:00:49.090> tags<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.570> street<00:00:50.989> parts<00:00:51.379> on

it was about tags and street parts on
postal<00:00:52.010> stickers<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.329> after<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:53.930> decided

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
postal stickers so after that I decided

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.930 
postal stickers so after that I decided
I<00:00:54.469> really<00:00:54.739> just<00:00:54.860> wanted<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.219> concentrate<00:00:55.579> on

what<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.149> think<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:56.600> like<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.839> smallest<00:00:57.559> kind

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
what I think is like the smallest kind

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.579 
what I think is like the smallest kind
of<00:00:58.640> repeating<00:00:59.120> because<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.989> lot<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.350> people

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
of repeating because a lot of people

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.290 
of repeating because a lot of people
taking<00:01:00.800> pictures<00:01:01.039> are<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.460> big<00:01:01.670> productions

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
taking pictures are the big productions
