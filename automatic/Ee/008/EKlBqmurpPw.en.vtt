four of them usually there's only two
but<00:02:21.130> for<00:02:21.340> some<00:02:21.520> reason<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.060> time<00:02:22.360> that's

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
but for some reason this time that's

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.080 
but for some reason this time that's
four<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.200> them<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.830> wasn't<00:02:24.070> about<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.460> die

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
four of them and I wasn't about to die

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.210 
four of them and I wasn't about to die
and<00:02:25.510> lose<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.560> souls<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.710> climbed<00:02:30.040> back<00:02:30.460> up

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and lose the souls so I climbed back up

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.670 
and lose the souls so I climbed back up
so<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.430> could<00:02:33.580> take<00:02:34.300> care<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.600> one<00:02:35.380> or<00:02:35.530> two

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
so that I could take care of one or two

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.670 
so that I could take care of one or two
of<00:02:35.800> them<00:02:35.950> at<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> time

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.920 

so<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.710> can<00:02:44.010> understand<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.210> ghosts<00:02:45.900> that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
so I can understand that the ghosts that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.260 
so I can understand that the ghosts that
you<00:02:46.230> fight<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.680> nalanda<00:02:47.010> ruins<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:47.850> go

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
you fight in nalanda ruins can go

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.960 
you fight in nalanda ruins can go
through<00:02:48.510> walls<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.260> they<00:02:49.440> ghosts<00:02:50.040> but

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
through walls because they ghosts but

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.120 
through walls because they ghosts but
these<00:02:51.270> guys<00:02:51.540> here<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> mosquitoes<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:52.980> are

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
these guys here the mosquitoes there are

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.820 
these guys here the mosquitoes there are
physical<00:02:53.370> entities<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:55.500> makes<00:02:55.740> no

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
physical entities and just makes no

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.010 
physical entities and just makes no
sense<00:02:55.950> they<00:02:56.460> can<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.790> through<00:02:57.030> walls<00:02:57.570> and

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
sense they can go through walls and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.940 
sense they can go through walls and
whatnot<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.320> still<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.710> great

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
whatnot but and this is still a great

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.440 
whatnot but and this is still a great
game<00:03:05.780> despite<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:07.020> some<00:03:07.560> some<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.280> these

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
game despite this some some of these

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:31.970 
game despite this some some of these
silly<00:03:10.430> occurrences

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.590
