00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.710
 they also unfortunately stopped here in mexico when having to talk 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.949
 because due to the great challenge yesterday he was with us 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.779
 for things that suddenly anyone can pass us coral 2% 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.599
 lack of knowledge of purchases 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.710
 efe 1 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.150
 in general you can bring up to 10 thousand after 10 thousand dollars that you bring 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.039
 you have precleras of 10 thousand a dollar assets to declare 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.580
 declare so 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.850
 at the exit of the country as at the entrance has shown his rejection to any 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.870
 Maybe it was very upset that situation comfort states 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.200
 united and in nothingness does not have to know that in Mexico the appointment is like this 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.140
 already the low costs of very innocent saffron with your bag with the money without 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 know that the law has to connect you just have to explain something that mexico 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.190
 It's not like the United States that when you go to work using or palenque 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.230
 the palate 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.850
 with a deposit not 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.950
 here in Mexico, especially in Palenques, after which we have on tour 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.890
 to pay at that time the businessman in cash because hamas in Mexico that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.040
 It is free of show tax 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.820
 that growth that is very important that then 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.530
 that does not have to declare that part 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.799
 but to arrive at the social airport because I think it is George grandson to suffer it 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.700
 the mayor the pgr 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.590
 we can say that what is done well has little to do with several 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.510
 hours 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.310
 ahead 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 thanks to the good afternoon to the smokers and the aztec america cgt 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 Thanks Madrid 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.750
 and well indeed jenni rivera has arrested who the agency of the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.820
 public ministry of the federation here the city of mexico from the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 eight in the morning 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.670
 by an oversight for not effectively declaring the money he was carrying 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.190
 I get the presumption that it was an oversight and how good everyone 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.790
 Mexicans and as foreigners we must make this statement upon departure and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.570
 the entrance eta to the country I think that this was a dismissal by yenny she 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.580
 already paid the fine is collaborating with the corresponding authorities good 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.700
 to solve all this and above all make it clear that this one that money 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.440
 is product l of your work also this data must be highlighted and above all 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.830
 for the family that is living in the United States, she is well 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.670
 collaborating with the authorities and it was simply an oversight for not 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.950
 declare the money that she had earned the product of three dates here 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.090
 in the city of mexico and good so far she keeps declaring follow 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.049
 collaborating 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.859
 are waiting for some hotel documents from your accountant in 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.489
 land ethics in the city of Guadalajara jalisco especially for 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.180
 in checking that the money is the product of their work the contracts 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.140
 some receipts and well, she is here with her mother yesterday 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.790
 the offices of science ep the public ministry of the federation 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.109
 Manigua not because it is intended that this lasted about five to six seven 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.400
 eight hours before 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.400
 until it is still to reynosa especially satisfactory for yenín 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.230
 I reiterate to you she is collaborating with the authorities to clarify this 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.880
 misunderstanding today I have seen how it was that the authorities realized that 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.229
 genil was carrying that money or how it was 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.469
 well apparently this was a random check on hand luggage 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.679
 and well it was the who and who's fingered and they noticed 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.889
 that he was carrying the money that was the product of his work and that there was no 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:18.739
 declared 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.680
 and well, what went out with him could have happened to any other passenger 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.519
 It is however good that she was stopped by the customs agents and put 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.409
 disposition of the federal police 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.659
 that they in turn put her at nothing with the public prosecutor's agent of 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:33.939
 the federation for reiterated 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.699
 It was a beautiful review of the sardana 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.040
 today Wednesday that comes after these 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.040
 7 8 hours what can happen 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:48.430
 good once you check that the money is effectively the product of the 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.589
 work of those who were paid a fine that is 20% 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:56.419
 the one that brought in ex that we are speaking that it is according to the procuraduría 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.959
 General of the Republic are already officially declaring that 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.109
 I was carrying 52 thousand dollars 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.750
 she thinks we force ourselves percent 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.000
 transport 10 thousand dollars without any problem it prolec center of 42 thousand 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.540
 Dollars 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.580
 pay a fine of 20% we're talking about eight thousand 400 dollars and 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.400
 Well, she will be able to retire 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.459
 however these could percent there is another scenario maybe that could 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.810
 say that you have to give in litigation the money but it will be checked but I reiterate 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.760
 and who is in the best disposition 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.040
 she would be talking to her accountant so that all the contracts of 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.550
 these three dates in which you already earned that money 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.559
 and that delay does not cause 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:39.819
 no mishap allen and rivera because I wanted to clarify so far 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.210
 has achieved 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.460
 I had planned to arrive at noon at the city of angels 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.620
 California 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.990
 this one can blame let's check especially if he had pending dates 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.670
 and I think that in view of this delay, a Mexican authority 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.470
 Well, I think you can talk and renegotiate dates but that 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.500
 let's talk later with your mother 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.939
 very good of all we will be in contact with you 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.139
 of everything that happens with credibility 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.159
 and what good, at the end of the day I think that sometimes artists are leaving a 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.960
 side by side we are not about to need our own because I do comic theater 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.630
 copies is of bedside table 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.930
 more information in relation to these returnees from serenity to 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.970
 approve the measure took noel the same today 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.159
 obviously the law and it's like that 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.189
 and has a good voice is there is not stopped is 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.240
 then return to first 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.629
 will have to show 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.110
 effectively fund the money well there 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.189
 with paying your fine fort 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.279
 by default because he omitted 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:40.179
 in declaring this money because maybe the money they pay has been declared 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:43.349
 recidivist percent said that since it was surely 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.099
 already declared the taxes 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.259
 but they had their entrepreneurs 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.059
 I do not know how the tax regime will be 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:50.930
 in fact in real estate 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.249
 that artists do not 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.080
 in short phage in the Mexican Republic 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.830
 all show that I think because it's culture the show is the 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.309
 tax center 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:01.189
 about income
