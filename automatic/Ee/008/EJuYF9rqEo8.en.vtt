00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.100
 mai am Gerd Pohl with lena fog 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.720
 manager of high school wood rufus 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.300
 light on the beautiful peninsula 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.770
 swans surrounded by beautiful nature 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.480
 I would like to invite you 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.030
 to look at our company 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.290
 the different cultures and rejoice 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.340
 me that so much interest for the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.340
 organic farming 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.449
 So we are on the weekly market 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.550
 and that's why we build as many as possible 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.850
 Vegetables to the here on board worthy 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.640
 are 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.550
 and now we are farming 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.430
 total operation same 35 hectares of it 24 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.610
 hectare of land four hectares of plaintiff 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.979
 to the ground cure four hectares of grain 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.780
 so that their own electricity can produce that 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.520
 Cereals are sold as bread cereals 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.190
 and the remaining hectas divide 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.979
 on in vegetables for the weekly market 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.890
 are very versatile things too 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.509
 Herbs a lot and then for the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.009
 have wholesale and cultures 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.979
 you picked particularly well to grow 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.580
 such as salad radishes 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.810
 spinat so i came to it 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.399
 ever in operation here too 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.080
 because it's the parental 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.130
 operation is already the sixth 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.020
 generation of the family 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.399
 manages the first four 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.170
 Generations naturally 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.509
 Organic farming so then 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.850
 There was nothing else then there are two 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.240
 generations freaked out with 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.190
 technology and chemistry beliefs i can 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.130
 hinder me from spreading fertilizer came there 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.380
 huge fudder with chemistry fertilizer that has 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.239
 something like burned in the skin and the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.590
 Feet were pretty good and so on 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.420
 I thought this can not be good 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.879
 Of course I did not know any answer 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.369
 because as a child grows so grows 

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:08.750
 You even keep it in there but me 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.150
 then I traveled a bit and the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.260
 seen from the outside world have it in others 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.060
 impressions then I was perfectly clear 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.470
 that I do not want it that way 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.360
 Not at all my style with the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.250
 nature with the life with the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.690
 to handle food and then vegetation 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.660
 Decide on that 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.069
 Wanted to switch to organic cultivation 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.140
 the topic of sustainability is real 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.120
 a big topic for us so first 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.940
 our idea is the hat with the yard 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.860
 of course it will do so 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.840
 yard should not burden the environment in 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.450
 None is a conventional one 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.650
 operation, it depends very much on the drip of 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.569
 industry we renounce the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.010
 spray and on the train on fertilizer 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.980
 and that's why we need a healthy one 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.660
 fruit consequence that means we are allowed salad 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.580
 Do not grow after salad we have to 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.110
 leave several years in between 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.150
 the floor can be repeated 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.040
 wasting the pests and the ones 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.650
 disease pressure is less worth all 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.550
 plants have a culture before the culture 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.860
 the ground clearance of 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.420
 disease burden and pests like that 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.590
 that they grow up optimally and healthy 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.270
 can and we usually need 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.750
 actually do nothing about pests 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.310
 and fight diseases because the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.730
 just not that by healthy 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.730
 fruit of 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.450
 since I just judge mine here 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.849
 apps and grooming and he sees you 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.700
 clearly these same bacteria in 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.950
 great variety the pink postel to the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.420
 rooted in colonies of these 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.480
 Bacteria make it out of the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.549
 soil nitrogen content that 79 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.500
 percent nitrogen in the soil air 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.910
 bind and plant available 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.980
 make a deposit here 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.540
 and then next spring 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.079
 is plowed then comes the cabbage here 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.690
 down 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.069
 and that will be a very good thing for the cabbage 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.629
 be good nitrogen fertilizer we need 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.650
 really nothing else to do well 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.090
 Of course , in the bio hacker, too 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.340
 be fertilized with this part 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.079
 legumes with fertilization and the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.470
 Coal is super supplied so coal 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.480
 cauliflower broccoli kohlrabi kale 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.489
 and Chinese cabbage and so on the custom 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 has a lot of nitrogen very much 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.989
 fertilizer also in organic way commemorates in 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.329
 In this case, founding a healthy one 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.540
 soil produces healthy plants 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.530
 outlook gives presentation and at the end 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.530
 also the healthy people 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.400
 if you just a tug 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.750
 has stood the runs and if the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.470
 then it vibrates like one 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.820
 steamroller 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.800
 and if one if the executor then 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.410
 drove and you want the finger there 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.210
 put it in it like concrete 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.240
 nothing happens anymore and that's why 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.980
 we need the ground with horses in 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.300
 the 60s are the last workhorses 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.570
 Gone out of here by the yard 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.380
 industrial agriculture that the 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.210
 Tug and then I have one 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.090
 fejde demonstration seen you know 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.680
 only in his mid-twenties and that with me 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.330
 work and that has me so deep 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.430
 this rest inspires this slow one 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.690
 according to lie but powerful and 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.860
 since then we will do that to the horses 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.660
 Working time must be ours 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:11.090
 soil fertility by a significant 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.220
 getting better we see how beautiful 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.790
 loose and airy kaka stays behind 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.170
 horses work no soil compaction 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.810
 I'm not really breathing properly 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.970
 forest floor quite healthy we have with the 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.010
 work spilled on herbs 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.990
 so we have a super clean acres 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.640
 get and the carrots can be undisturbed 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.100
 I'm sure I'll grow until autumn 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.660
 comfortable superman quality, yes, where to go 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.700
 Running is the ground is always 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.770
 Loosely there that one enters here 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.450
 that does not vibrate that it is relative to 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.190
 compared to the tractor relatively easy 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.890
 a lot of small ponytails and so on 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.510
 and now between 06 norwegians are missing 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.650
 we use and one firm 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.720
 Employees are now hired for the horses 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.380
 work takes care and that is no more 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.790
 to think away from our android before 23 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.160
 years , such development has started 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.320
 shown that bio is getting bigger and bigger 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.280
 More in the supermarkets rain road is there 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.410
 made me a bit dizzy 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.030
 because that naturally leads to that 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.040
 insane price back on the farms 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.140
 manufacturer cheaper cheaper cheaper 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.080
 this leads to more and more technology 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.060
 ever larger structures ever smaller 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.510
 pay wages and so on and there 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.880
 looked with care today and I am 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.750
 quite glad that I need to know now 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.390
 has slowed down 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.920
 that people are no longer just in the 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.870
 Supermarkets organic shopping but we 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.580
 go back to the specialty shops 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.350
 Organic shop on the weekly market and so on 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.889
 further because there we can as small 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.389
 farmers or medium-sized farmers 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.129
 because our products are much better 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.050
 place and fit the structures 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.639
 just better together once a year 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.560
 We invite all our customers 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.479
 and we also get 4 500 customers 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.449
 bring the friends families with then 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.680
 we do field round trips and 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.599
 round walks and so on and show the 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.729
 Greenhouses and test food and such 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:51.279
 then on and then the people live 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.110
 we come my farmer and mine 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:56.169
 farm and so on and as they talk 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.569
 all year of my devise it me 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:01.120
 would like to economise as if the 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.770
 customer runs next to me all day 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.240
 and constantly watching me at work 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.000
 would and the customer still evening 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.740
 said so exactly , I want that of the 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.300
 bauer works and not somehow like that 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.590
 secretly squirt here and there what 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.250
 What you do not use the customer 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.539
 wants to tell 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.539
 That's not how we work
