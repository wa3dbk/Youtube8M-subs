00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
number that you chose name from the deck

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.750 
number that you chose name from the deck
you<00:02:22.880> shuffled<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.990> led<00:02:24.230> us<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.520> five<00:02:25.730> of

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
you shuffled that led us to the five of

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.360 
you shuffled that led us to the five of
spades<00:02:26.200> how<00:02:27.200> do<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.380> have<00:02:27.530> chosen<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.100> number

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
spades how do you have chosen the number

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.970 
spades how do you have chosen the number
eight<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:29.660> would<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:29.990> had<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.320> Queen<00:02:30.590> and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
eight we would have had the Queen and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.560 
eight we would have had the Queen and
then<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:32.000> would<00:02:32.180> have<00:02:32.270> been<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.450> different

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
then this would have been a different

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.640 
then this would have been a different
card<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.170> that's<00:02:33.290> would<00:02:33.410> have<00:02:33.500> been<00:02:33.590> a

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
card and that's would have been a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.410 
card and that's would have been a
different<00:02:33.770> card<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.700> understand<00:02:35.330> that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
different card so you understand that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.690 
different card so you understand that
the<00:02:35.600> card<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.590> chosen<00:02:36.980> from<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.280> outset

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
the card that you chosen from the outset

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.850 
the card that you chosen from the outset
has<00:02:37.910> led<00:02:38.120> us<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.330> these<00:02:38.630> these<00:02:39.260> other<00:02:39.470> cards

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
has led us to these these other cards

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.180 
has led us to these these other cards
here<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:41.239> re<00:02:41.600> ended<00:02:42.020> up<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.590> car<00:02:43.040> that

production of the future based on the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.850 
production of the future based on the
order<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.480> actually<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.470> exceeded<00:02:57.680> this

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
order and actually and you exceeded this

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.220 
order and actually and you exceeded this
once<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.220> total<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.390> if<00:02:59.750> we<00:02:59.900> add<00:03:00.020> them<00:03:00.170> up

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
once it is total and if we add them up

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.750 
once it is total and if we add them up
five<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.770> four<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.040> nine<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.310> three<00:03:01.640> is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
five and four is nine and three is

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.880 
five and four is nine and three is
twelve<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.540> think<00:03:03.020> Tom<00:03:03.140> over<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.440> covers<00:03:03.739> is

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
twelve I think Tom over the covers is

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.180 
twelve I think Tom over the covers is
tall<00:03:04.160> you'll<00:03:04.340> see<00:03:04.550> 12<00:03:05.450> now<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.170> see<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.739> the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
tall you'll see 12 now you see and the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.949 
tall you'll see 12 now you see and the
only<00:03:07.370> way<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> could<00:03:08.209> have<00:03:08.480> accurately

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
only way I could have accurately

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.680 
only way I could have accurately
predicted<00:03:09.620> those<00:03:09.950> three<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.310> clubs<00:03:10.520> unless<00:03:11.390> 12

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
predicted those three of clubs unless 12

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.800 
predicted those three of clubs unless 12
was<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.020> I<00:03:12.140> had<00:03:12.290> some<00:03:12.650> foreknowledge<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.850> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
was if I had some foreknowledge of the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.479 
was if I had some foreknowledge of the
number<00:03:15.110> nine<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.590> would<00:03:15.709> lead<00:03:15.950> us<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.130> this

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
number nine that would lead us to this

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.060 
number nine that would lead us to this
five<00:03:17.090> him<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.290> five<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.500> spades<00:03:18.650> in

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
five him and it's the five of spades in

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.650 
five him and it's the five of spades in
this<00:03:19.190> case<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.970> envelope<00:03:20.330> you've<00:03:20.480> had

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
this case and the envelope you've had

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.080 
this case and the envelope you've had
from<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.020> very<00:03:21.050> beginning

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
from the very beginning

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.330 
from the very beginning
right<00:03:22.209> so<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.959> number<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.349> usuals<00:03:23.769> led<00:03:24.160> us

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
right so the number of the usuals led us

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.150 
right so the number of the usuals led us
to<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.640> black<00:03:24.910> five<00:03:25.300> or<00:03:25.959> open<00:03:26.379> up<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.739> the
