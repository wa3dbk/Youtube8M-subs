essentially this is how creel should

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.620 
essentially this is how creel should
have<00:00:26.340> been<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.730> mean<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.240> should<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.480> been

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
have been I mean they should have been

here and then the smokestacks put them
off<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.340> side<00:03:32.600> yeah<00:03:33.600> it's<00:03:33.810> not<00:03:33.930> perfect

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
off to the side yeah it's not perfect

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.790

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
in top of his head it's not perfect as

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.000 
in top of his head it's not perfect as
you<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.080> see<00:03:40.260> that's<00:03:40.920> what<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.100> box<00:03:41.280> says

you can see that's what the box says
it's<00:03:44.010> fine<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.400> then<00:03:44.550> these<00:03:44.760> clips<00:03:45.239> they<00:03:45.390> clip

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
it's fine and then these clips they clip

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.870 
it's fine and then these clips they clip
on<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.320> those<00:03:46.560> pieces<00:03:47.100> right<00:03:47.400> there<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:47.820> you

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
on to those pieces right there so you

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.820 
on to those pieces right there so you
can<00:03:48.090> lock<00:03:48.330> him<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.930> his<00:03:49.140> load<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:54.470> he<00:03:55.470> rolls
