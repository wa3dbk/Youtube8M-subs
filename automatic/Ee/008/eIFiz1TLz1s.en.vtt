00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.420
 world premiere at the m gmbh of bmw der 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.600
 new m5 gives herself the honor and wears 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.340
 at the same time a heavy burden of the 507th 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.789
 ps strong predecessor was among the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
 most potent power limousine in the world 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.580
 as expected new had everything 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 better than the predecessor 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 the success is for a small one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.990
 companies like m gmbh immensely 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990
 important 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.540
 the most important lounge this year 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.730
 of course yes and 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.100
 highest volume model and accor product 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.840
 Actually, the m3 is the m5 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.650
 Of course, at least the second most important 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.239
 model and we are finally happy 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.239
 to be allowed to introduce this here 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.830
 who are quick but unobtrusive 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.739
 wanted to be on the road was already with the m5 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.600
 always give the outside a good advice 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.760
 endeavored socially acceptable 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.660
 Limousine draws from a new V8 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.479
 biturbo strammer 560 hp around 50 horses 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.000
 more than her predecessor unfortunately counts 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.229
 four-door with just 1 9 tons not 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.229
 straight to the lightweights 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.759
 of course we try, of course 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.380
 our weight so well under control 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.460
 keep as any possible that is 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.160
 we use 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.380
 significantly more lightweight components than 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.000
 for example in the series because they have 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.110
 it addressed that one of the weight 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.220
 decisive factors regarding 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.979
 acceleration view curve behavior 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.869
 in terms of consumption and here we do 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.090
 very much we all have a lot 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.610
 components we go we have a lot 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.369
 a lot of carbon components meanwhile in 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.750
 our vehicle and we screw 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.420
 ultimately, or we will work on everyone 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.710
 gram weight to the possible in the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 not bring the vehicle straight away 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.119
 while under the hood of the predecessor 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.850
 still 1 5 liter large v10 cylinder 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.490
 was placed sits at the new m5 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.610
 4.4 liter big v8 with biturbo 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.610
 charging 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.290
 you want to downsize at m gmbh 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.930
 but still he does not speak 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 In principle, one can from 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.579
 Downsizing speak of everything else 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.530
 is it rather a upgrading we have 30 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.209
 percent more torque than that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.040
 predecessors we have ten percent more 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.840
 performance we have 30 percent less 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.790
 consumption and in this combination 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.769
 I would say the customer gets 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.579
 significantly more for his money and thus 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:45.659
 some upgrading the maximum 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.720
 torque of the charged 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.989
 Gasoline direct injection is at 680 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.130
 newton meter in 4 4 seconds spurts of 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.470
 new m5 on pace 100 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.060
 the 200 mark is already off the stand 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.160
 cracked after 13 seconds 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.010
 the top speed can by means of 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.580
 optional m driver's package up to 305 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.620
 km / h are unlocked 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.450
 we come from the race track and 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.700
 in the end, every m if we really 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.190
 actually has to write on it 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.780
 deriving from the sport of the 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.060
 race track and that makes a difference 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.310
 again the vehicles finally from 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.020
 our standard vehicles our customers 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.550
 go to the race track our customers 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.770
 want to go to the racecourse and 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.150
 After that, we will eventually also do the 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.150
 performance of their vehicles 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.150
 A m5 is due to the low 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.240
 Demand not to have planned is the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.570
 M5 sedan priced from around 103,000 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.430
 Euro 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.430
 probably the one who can afford
