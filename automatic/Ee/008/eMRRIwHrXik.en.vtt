00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.380

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.020
 case over look 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.729
 and otherwise I would say before me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.260
 I'm talking in my head and collar 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.630
 in the kitchen and I'll show you the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.939
 Start recipes with this super 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 delicious french toast filled rollups 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.119
 blueberries with raspberries and which 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.939
 Great for a picnic or something 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.259
 Just for something special there too 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.939
 Of course, doing a bit does 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.939
 blueberries I have to climb one 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.119
 taken a plate is also something milk 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.610
 sugar and 1 1 you start first 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.990
 so that the edges of the trust write 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.479
 by the way, that's perfect 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 Write a great sandwich because the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.100
 Of course, much bigger ones are depending 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.350
 how many post did you want to have for 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.880
 want to have as many role-discs 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.420
 cuts her of course I had 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.420
 her bed 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.230
 and then you try your toast slices 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
 as possible as possible to get falls 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.190
 no small mini scooter from too little 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 do not have one then you can do that too 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.150
 I make other little red things 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.490
 took her a lot of glass bottle and 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.210
 important things are as bad as 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.210
 possible to get 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.890
 and in the next step, you are stroking 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.560
 then you get the cream or nutella or 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.080
 peanut butter or cream cheese depending on 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.700
 what you have there on your post disc 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.550
 so a bit outward 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.200
 gossip it to the edge and then you lay down 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.470
 your raspberries or your blueberries 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.090
 strawberries , for example , came on top of that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.770
 and cut small and put on it and 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.990
 then he starts as close as possible to the whole 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.330
 possible to clear you must of course 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.920
 a little push that's holding what 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.510
 they did believe her what not so 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.850
 Liquid are not working so well then 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.860
 You can also depending on where you get the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.920
 use cream or nutella to do this 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.720
 so to speak , and that 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.720
 you do with all your rolls 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.380
 and when you're done with it then 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.870
 you have to your one about 3 tablespoons milk 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.209
 and turns it all into one 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.280
 liquid and then he starts with it 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.180
 your rolls gradually into this 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.890
 to do liquid 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.110
 It is important that we are above all 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.110
 consider pages with the liquid 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.849
 then he gives a bit of butter or 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.470
 Margarine in a pole and puts the 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.420
 then it is purely important that rolls 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.700
 Of course we always apply it that way 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.470
 that they are golden brown on all sides 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.849
 become 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.170
 and if you separated hertens with and 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.150
 fresh from the clinic and still 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.330
 you are then warm in rolls 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.099
 the sugar cinnamon mixture so that you 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.080
 from all sides are nicely covered with 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:50.349
 and then you can already 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.030
 Eat the next recipe are original 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.099
 and for that you need 50 grams 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.690
 haferflocken a 80 milliliter of milk 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.420
 teaspoon parish vanilla one and a half 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.579
 teaspoon shazam because you have one 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.980
 tablespoon strawberry jam 30 grams 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.140
 natural yoghurt and 50 grams of fresh 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.970
 raspberries then you look for a vessel 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.430
 you can give there yours 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.680
 haferflocken the milk to yogurt to 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.110
 jam the skier warm and the vanilla 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.630
 Pure closes the lid and shakes 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.729
 the whole thing good by the end 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.199
 then they always come on top and that 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.700
 then put her in the night 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.410
 fridge and the breakfast is ready 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.600
 Our tab is it the rhubarb 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.460
 drink in the morning super good to fresh 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.130
 can drink or unload something 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.410
 could be with friends for the evening 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.820
 you need 200 grams of sugar for that 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.010
 four rod mission in the rhubarb 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.810
 and so much water that the whole 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.700
 the rhubarb is covered the whole crackled 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.700
 then stir in a pot in between 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.990
 do not forget so it's one 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.940
 sympathetic consistency gets and the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.590
 rhubarb then falls apart 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.380
 you give it all in a mixer like that 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.990
 nice and soft and one of the 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.710
 consistency and then there is a swift one 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.710
 hour in the fridge 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.700

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.710

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.010
 still believe in his little game 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.800
 exclude that they are so completely 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.490
 pretty in the glass and then give her 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.320
 frozen blueberries at the bottom of yours 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.870
 Cocktail glass over drinking glass enters 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.810
 bit of the fruit has to get out there and 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.280
