00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello everyone my name is on and good 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.389

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.599
 mods and I take pictures for the third time therefore 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.000
 everything will be all very fast and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.859
 I hope that that without any delay 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.690
 for some reason mekravt began to fly out 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.510
 but it doesn't matter today we have a mod 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 which is called tahu or passed smog 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.220
 mod for some of them which i don't watch 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 In principle, but I can google and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 explain to you what is the essence 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.759
 the essence is what he adds such 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.800
 small dolls in one block height and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.360
 width which will do for you all 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 dirty work fight dig mine 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
 resources collect all all all all all 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 Now I will tell you this anime 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.100
 called there a project spirit and there was 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.719
 the main characters were her names foxes and she 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.670
 would have been a super ability she was 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 a puppeteer and these dolls 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.680
 added to maykravt ok we went 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.969
 after a brief briefing 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.960
 let's sort crafting recipes first recipe 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.810
 crafting dg crafting hearts dont know why 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.340
 heart but it looks like a heart but Kravets 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.869
 of two lapis lazuli 3 redstone and 1 diamond 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.640
 single diamond 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.460
 Here you get this thing 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.680
 like a heart and craft any of it 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.950
 absolutely any dolls and 1 doll that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.799
 we take a look called shan hai doll 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.990
 does she here that he slept by him she finds 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.990
 enemies she writes you about this in the chat and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 if you turn on the patrol mod now i'm about 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.900
 mods in more detail modes rather kill 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.180
 him so she writes about 2 creeper 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.420
 let's zombies zombies remember 4 on here 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.640
 she found a zombie right within her 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 reach and beats 4 zombies 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.630
 Well, in general, such a funny doll 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.280
 Now let's take an interesting example 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.689
 let's sort the modes that follow mod 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.710
 mod i 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.829
 which will make them follow you 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.319
 further it is ridvan mod yes she will sit 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.450
 you can't have two dolls at once 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.260
 become children I checked none of 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.390
 them just fall off and standby mod she 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.220
 you can not stand for anything 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.280
 move them push somewhere and so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.959
 forth next doll this doll miner 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.069
 like this kraft 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.370
 and they call her chicken, but target, that is, no 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.430
 goals with a bunch and we are in working mode 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.349
 we get ore and put how many 5 pieces 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.950
 her range is not so much 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.200
 big 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.430
 but when she finds she owes you about 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.890
 say this 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.140
 get if you wonder where 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.870
 is all gone all the resources of 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.859
 where the hell are mine 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.810
 the caravans then simply click on the chest 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.510
 her and she should open but for some reason 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.340
 she zagabovanna writes me that you are not mine 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.969
 the owner, that is, if you are someone else's cookie 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.780
 try to open it hrenushki will not give 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.930
 you do it 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.310
 at least try to do this 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.430
 so patrol mod must be enabled 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.090
 necessarily and put some there 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.340
 three 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:22.299
 Here she writes in the chat that the three ore gold 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.760
 found and open the chest with all the gold 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.470
 ore can be obtained and so on next 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.260
 the doll we look at is a doll 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.269
 creeper and he won't blow his own not 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.889
 spare me already blew twice after 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.260
 this my maykravtov crumble therefore 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.989
 just superficially that it works here 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.359
 so now we spawn a patrol mod 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.599
 she writes you in chat rooms finds someone and 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:47.409
 goes and blows up and after death the doll 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:51.060
 a doll falls out and you can 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:54.370
 use and once again so stendby mod 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.629
 okay, craft is pretty with her 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.109
 cheap here's a blast pretty strong 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:06.299
 probably even stronger than tnt as two 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:09.310
 creeper about the amount of here so 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.290
 the next doll we will see this 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.169
 doll 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.109
 russia rush dollars russian doll kravets 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:19.539
 She is a chest 4 wool and $ 1 correspondent 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.300
 what he does she collects just 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.050
 collects things from her much more 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.400
 slots 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.690
 and if we turn on she will find will gather and 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.090
 you can open it here 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.430
 pick up if you notice and have her full as 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.480
 would 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.790
 of four even more than the chest 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.560
 number of slots yes I said correctly 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.880
 these all have one line of fleets 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.840
 so somewhere she wants to climb 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:58.280
 okay okay next doll that we 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:02.430
 let's see this doll ender juice she 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:08.100
 serves radar radar mobs where she 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:12.660
 let's sleep and that's it 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.440
 she does not seem to be looking for 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.330
 delivered and writes to you in the chat 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.490
 mysterious characters let's set 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:29.220
 some sort of spavner for example 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:31.580
 pigs do and turn on the patrol like this 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.330
 so he found what he wrote to you in the chat that 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.670
 found spawn pigs 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.370
 writes about his location that is there 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:45.590
 of the world as I understand it is norse 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.830
 north pig so if you change it will 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:54.300
 place a sauce on it all in general 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.460
 takes into account perfectly and the following 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:03.150
 doll which adds that this mod 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:05.760
 fucking kidding doll is actually this 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.060
 Maurice doll I do not know what he is 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.500
 makes it useless but the description was 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.260
 it is written that this doll is exactly 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.030
 repeats the most favorite doll of the main 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.000
 the heroine of this cartoon November lived there 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.640
 anything at all, and did it for uporotyh 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.800
 animeshnika in general 2 man 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.010
 you need like this doll which is just 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.580
 for tests of various 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.320
 at least she can and nothing 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.830
 useless so I forgot about one more 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.169
 doll tell a doll 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:42.060
 lumberjack like that kraftitsa 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:44.020
 and joma not for long so it is called 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.240
 she only reacts to the trees 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.520
 nearby so here are all sorts of 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.469
 designs we will not carry unfortunately and 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.159
 her range is not so big 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:57.969
 so if we plant and she immediately 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:07:01.840
 began to deteriorate somewhere but here's the body 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:03.490
 spoils and starts hacking wait 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.699
 we do not want to go down she wants me everything 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.509

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:12.249

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:17.770
 royal castle burned me fourth 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:22.360
