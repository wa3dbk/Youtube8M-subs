crossover and when to use it it's not

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.710 
crossover and when to use it it's not
necessarily<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:18.000> bring<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.630> in

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
necessarily you just bring it up in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
there's not too much space between you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.290 
there's not too much space between you
when<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.480> making<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> move<00:00:53.030> every<00:00:54.030> move<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
when you're making a move every move I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
when you're making a move every move I
like<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> make<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> stay

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
like to make I like to I have to stay

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
like to make I like to I have to stay
low<00:00:56.550> first<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.600> can't<00:00:57.870> carry<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
low first of all you can't carry the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.450 
low first of all you can't carry the
ball<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.710> any<00:00:58.859> move<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.940> course<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:02.280> want

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
ball on any move of course and you want

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.009 
ball on any move of course and you want
to<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.670> tight<00:01:03.210> movements<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:03.840> you're

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to have tight movements which you're

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440 
to have tight movements which you're
following<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.189> first<00:01:05.519> when<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.060> go<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> like

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
following it so first when I go I like

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.530 
following it so first when I go I like
to<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.960> first<00:01:07.170> step<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.790> go<00:01:08.790> between<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> legs

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
to my first step I go between the legs

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.390 
to my first step I go between the legs
that's<00:01:09.900> probably<00:01:10.080> my<00:01:10.260> first<00:01:10.530> move<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that's probably my first move just to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.359 
that's probably my first move just to
see<00:01:11.549> how<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> guy<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.090> filling<00:01:12.840> them<00:01:13.020> out

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
see how the guy is filling them out

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.740 
see how the guy is filling them out
hopefully<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.030> I'm<00:01:15.330> getting<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
hopefully when I do this I'm getting the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.039 
hopefully when I do this I'm getting the
shift<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> weight<00:01:16.670> then<00:01:17.670> while<00:01:18.360> he's<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
shift is weight then while he's about to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.390 
shift is weight then while he's about to
try<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> beat<00:01:19.500> me<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.680> next<00:01:19.920> spot<00:01:20.189> I

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
try to beat me to the next spot I

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.270 
try to beat me to the next spot I
crossover<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.840> while<00:01:22.619> he's<00:01:22.799> turning<00:01:23.159> his

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
crossover and while he's turning his

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.690 
crossover and while he's turning his
body

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
body

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
body
it's<00:01:24.330> another<00:01:24.720> cross<00:01:25.340> maybe<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it's another cross maybe it's to the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.539 
it's another cross maybe it's to the
basket<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.619> maybe<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> defender

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
basket or maybe if I see a defender

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
basket or maybe if I see a defender
there<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.509> step<00:01:30.780> back

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
there it's a step back

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.490 
there it's a step back
tight<00:01:32.159> shot<00:01:32.460> release<00:01:33.500> follow-through

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
tight shot release follow-through

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.640 
tight shot release follow-through
balance<00:01:35.340> hopefully<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> goes<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.439> but<00:01:37.439> once

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
balance hopefully it goes in but once

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.749 
balance hopefully it goes in but once
again<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:39.180> motion<00:01:39.420> you're<00:01:40.229> low

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
again and good motion you're low

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
again and good motion you're low
hopefully<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> big<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> between

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
hopefully you have a big on you between

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.410 
hopefully you have a big on you between
the<00:01:43.649> legs<00:01:43.890> crossed<00:01:45.259> cross<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:47.119> pull<00:01:48.119> up

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.090 

mostly<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.600> keys<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.500> double<00:01:52.740> crossover

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
mostly the keys to the double crossover

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.090 
mostly the keys to the double crossover
again<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.420> try<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.600> find<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:55.170> advantage

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
again is you try to find your advantage

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.380 
again is you try to find your advantage
hopefully<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> disadvantage<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> other

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
hopefully a disadvantage for the other

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.980 
hopefully a disadvantage for the other
team<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> make<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> guy<00:01:59.250> fear<00:01:59.579> you

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
team you have to make the guy fear you
