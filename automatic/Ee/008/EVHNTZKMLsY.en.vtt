water in the crawlspace we had high

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.200

crawlspace we had a stench smell mildew

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.679 
crawlspace we had a stench smell mildew
smell<00:00:25.140> coming<00:00:25.710> out<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.480> just

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
smell coming out of it and it just

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
smell coming out of it and it just
wasn't<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.170> pleasant<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.189> come<00:00:29.429> into<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
wasn't very pleasant to come into the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
wasn't very pleasant to come into the
house<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> smell<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.439> especially

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
house and and to smell that especially

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.459 
house and and to smell that especially
in<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> brand<00:00:32.579> new<00:00:32.759> house<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.469> contractor

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
in a brand new house the contractor

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.950 
in a brand new house the contractor
didn't<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> proper<00:00:35.430> drainage<00:00:36.149> system<00:00:36.780> in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
didn't put the proper drainage system in

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.799 
didn't put the proper drainage system in
so<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.860> needed<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> problem<00:00:38.879> fixed

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
so we needed to get the problem fixed

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.590 
so we needed to get the problem fixed
my<00:00:40.410> approach<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> internet

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
my approach was to get on the internet

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.110 
my approach was to get on the internet
and<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.050> looked<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.950> testimonials<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and I looked at the testimonials of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.080 
and I looked at the testimonials of
people<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:46.100> used<00:00:47.100> woods<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> past

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
people that have used woods in the past

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.189 
people that have used woods in the past
so<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.450> sounded<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.260> Woods<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.199> company

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so it sounded like Woods was the company

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.830 
so it sounded like Woods was the company
that<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:53.190> should<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.180> person<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that we should go with the person that I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.959 
that we should go with the person that I
talked<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:56.180> seemed<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.890> better

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
talked to seemed to have a better

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.599 
talked to seemed to have a better
understanding<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:01.020> problem<00:01:01.620> than<00:01:02.250> some

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
understanding of the problem than some

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.549 
understanding of the problem than some
of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> other<00:01:03.000> people<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.719> came<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.379> give

of the other people that came in to give

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.429 
of the other people that came in to give
us<00:01:04.680> estimates<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:06.510> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.960> surprised

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
us estimates I was kind of surprised

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.530 
us estimates I was kind of surprised
that<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> day<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> half<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.390> able

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that in a day and a half they were able

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.270 
that in a day and a half they were able
to<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:10.260> care<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> problem

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to take care of the problem

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.240 
to take care of the problem
now<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> materials<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.799> impressed

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
now the materials I was really impressed

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.060 
now the materials I was really impressed
with<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> very<00:01:16.049> thick<00:01:16.439> vinyl

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
with that they use a very thick vinyl

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.420 
with that they use a very thick vinyl
material<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.590> across<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
material that they put down across the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.480 
material that they put down across the
crawlspace<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> walls<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.799> so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
