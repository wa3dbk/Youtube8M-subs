Pacific<00:00:24.029> food<00:00:24.180> making<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> little<00:00:24.720> cameo<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.500> I

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
Pacific food making a little cameo and I

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.349 
Pacific food making a little cameo and I
think<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.070> was<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.369> drawn<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.000> polish

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
think I was really drawn to this polish

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.169 
think I was really drawn to this polish
because<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.260> clashed<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.340> everything<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
because it clashed with everything but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.810 
because it clashed with everything but
in<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:31.019> way<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:32.309> anything<00:00:32.700> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
in a really good way it if anything it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
in a really good way it if anything it
was<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.120> unexpected<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
was really unexpected it's kind of a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.790 
was really unexpected it's kind of a
tribute<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.640> April<00:00:36.300> showers<00:00:36.690> even<00:00:37.110> though<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
tribute to April showers even though it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.619 
tribute to April showers even though it
hasn't<00:00:38.370> really<00:00:38.460> rained<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.360> last

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
hasn't really rained that much last

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.190 
hasn't really rained that much last
month<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:41.329> cute<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> themed<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
month but it's just cute to be themed I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
month but it's just cute to be themed I
guess<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.710> used<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> big<00:00:44.700> fan<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> crest

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
guess I used to be a big fan of crest

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.560 
guess I used to be a big fan of crest
until<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.350> swore<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> off<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.250> February<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.090> was

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
until I swore it off in February I was

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
until I swore it off in February I was
using<00:00:48.780> crest<00:00:49.320> ProHealth

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
using crest ProHealth

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.330 
using crest ProHealth
and<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.850> making<00:00:51.480> me<00:00:52.100> develop<00:00:53.100> this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and it was making me develop this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.310 
and it was making me develop this
strange<00:00:53.850> white<00:00:54.149> foam<00:00:54.600> around<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.170> mouth

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
strange white foam around my mouth

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.709 
strange white foam around my mouth
probably<00:00:55.890> 20<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> 30<00:00:56.820> minutes<00:00:57.120> after<00:00:57.239> brushing

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
probably 20 to 30 minutes after brushing

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.340 
probably 20 to 30 minutes after brushing
and<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.460> literally<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.270> skin<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.289> my

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and it would be literally the skin on my

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.399 
and it would be literally the skin on my
mouth<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.280> dissolving<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.840> switched<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
mouth just dissolving so I switched to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
mouth just dissolving so I switched to
Colgate<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.519> am<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.119> loving<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
Colgate and I am really loving this

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.969 
Colgate and I am really loving this
stuff<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> formula<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.530> toothpaste

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
stuff and the formula of this toothpaste

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.700 
stuff and the formula of this toothpaste
really<00:01:08.729> lingers<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.840> mouth<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.470> your

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
really lingers in your mouth so your

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
really lingers in your mouth so your
mouth<00:01:10.860> feels<00:01:11.189> minty<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.820> longer<00:01:12.180> amounts<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
mouth feels minty for longer amounts of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.890 
mouth feels minty for longer amounts of
time<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> whitening<00:01:15.450> components

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
time and as for the whitening components

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.770 
time and as for the whitening components
of<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.290> can't<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.369> claim<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.570> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of it I can't really claim that it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
of it I can't really claim that it's
made<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.140> teeth<00:01:19.320> whiter<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:20.040> they've

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
made my teeth whiter because they've

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999 
made my teeth whiter because they've
been<00:01:20.939> pretty<00:01:21.299> much<00:01:21.390> consistent<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.350> perhaps

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
been pretty much consistent so perhaps

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.740 
been pretty much consistent so perhaps
it's<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.460> maintaining<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.240> color<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.630> my

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it's been maintaining the color of my

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
it's been maintaining the color of my
teeth<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.619> third<00:01:25.799> favorite<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> canteen<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
teeth my third favorite is a canteen I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
teeth my third favorite is a canteen I
used<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> purple<00:01:28.409> canteen<00:01:28.920> until<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
used to have a purple canteen until I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
used to have a purple canteen until I
had<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> retire<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.479> my<00:01:30.689> calf<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.020> wasn't

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
had to retire it my calf just wasn't

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
had to retire it my calf just wasn't
very<00:01:31.409> sturdy<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.100> into<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> student<00:01:32.670> store

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
very sturdy so into the student store

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
very sturdy so into the student store
and<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.240> splurged<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.110> army<00:01:34.470> green

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and I splurged on this army green

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.270 
and I splurged on this army green
canteen<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.490> by<00:01:35.939> Under<00:01:36.210> Armour<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.960> was

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
canteen it's by Under Armour and it was

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
canteen it's by Under Armour and it was
$25<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.270> most<00:01:39.630> I've<00:01:39.869> ever<00:01:40.020> invested

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
$25 which is the most I've ever invested

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.190 
$25 which is the most I've ever invested
on<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.549> canteen<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:42.600> drinking<00:01:42.930> why<00:01:43.020> don't

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
on a canteen but I'm drinking why don't

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.139 
on a canteen but I'm drinking why don't
have<00:01:43.290> servings<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.130> bottle<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.579> day<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
have servings of this bottle a day so I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.819 
have servings of this bottle a day so I
think<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.659> pretty<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.470> system

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
think that's pretty good for my system

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.060 
think that's pretty good for my system
it's<00:01:47.280> got<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.759> awesome<00:01:48.000> Popoff<00:01:48.780> cap<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070

like<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.680> sci-fi<00:02:55.950> action

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
like it because it it's a sci-fi action

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.220 
like it because it it's a sci-fi action
film<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.660> sci-fi<00:02:57.870> that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
film and it's not the sci-fi that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.380 
film and it's not the sci-fi that
deterred<00:02:58.530> me<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.950> was<00:02:59.190> action<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.300> I'm

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
deterred me it was action and I'm

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.000 
deterred me it was action and I'm
typically<00:03:00.750> not<00:03:00.930> drawn<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.350> action<00:03:01.680> films

unless there's a really interesting plot

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.590 
unless there's a really interesting plot
and<00:03:04.080> Total<00:03:04.650> Recall<00:03:04.770> has<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.790> here's<00:03:06.330> the

basic summary of it it takes place in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.660 
basic summary of it it takes place in
the<00:03:08.700> future<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.420> Mars<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.739> colony<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.459> Earth

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the future and Mars is a colony of Earth

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.660 
the future and Mars is a colony of Earth
and<00:03:12.290> unfortunately<00:03:13.290> Mars<00:03:13.830> isn't<00:03:14.100> very<00:03:14.459> well

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
and unfortunately Mars isn't very well

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.729 
and unfortunately Mars isn't very well
kept<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.480> run<00:03:15.720> by<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.959> really<00:03:16.350> corrupt

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
kept it's run by this really corrupt

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.090 
kept it's run by this really corrupt
institution<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.060> all<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:19.049> marginalized<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
institution and all the marginalized and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.250 
institution and all the marginalized and
socially<00:03:20.670> disenfranchised<00:03:21.510> people<00:03:21.780> are

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
socially disenfranchised people are

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.610 
socially disenfranchised people are
inhabiting<00:03:23.160> Mars<00:03:23.400> now<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.440> things<00:03:25.440> are

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
inhabiting Mars now and so things are

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.140 
inhabiting Mars now and so things are
just<00:03:25.650> getting<00:03:26.010> worse<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.760> worse

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
just getting worse and worse

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.640 
just getting worse and worse
so<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.420> higher<00:03:27.600> power<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.170> starting<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.560> make

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
so this higher power is starting to make
