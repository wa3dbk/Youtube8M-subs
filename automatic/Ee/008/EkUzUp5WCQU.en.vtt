that's not an option but yes the roach
is<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.890> recently<00:01:20.340> added<00:01:20.580> unit<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
is a recently added unit in the in the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
is a recently added unit in the in the
universe<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> game<00:01:23.009> obviously<00:01:23.189> it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
universe not in the game obviously it's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.039

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
being a planet the zerg grew traveled
there<00:01:32.820> found<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.420> slugs<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.200> very

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
there found these slugs that are very

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.270 
there found these slugs that are very
fast<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.920> regenerate<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:37.070> absorb<00:01:38.070> their

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
fast to regenerate so they absorb their

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.460 
fast to regenerate so they absorb their
genetic<00:01:38.700> composition<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.509> created<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
genetic composition and created the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.560 
genetic composition and created the
roach<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> characterized<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.299> its

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
roach which is characterized for its

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.170 
roach which is characterized for its
acid<00:01:43.350> attack<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.950> penetrates<00:01:44.640> neo<00:01:44.850> steel

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
acid attack that penetrates neo steel

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.340 
acid attack that penetrates neo steel

I<00:04:14.970> guess<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.050> cats<00:04:16.290> were<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> little<00:04:16.920> something

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
I guess the cats were a little something

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.580 
I guess the cats were a little something
yeah<00:04:18.060> but<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.270> known<00:04:18.540> all<00:04:18.900> seriousness<00:04:19.260> I

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
yeah but I known all seriousness I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.320 
yeah but I known all seriousness I
reached<00:04:20.270> diamond<00:04:21.410> when<00:04:22.410> diamond<00:04:23.070> was<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
reached diamond when diamond was the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.630 
reached diamond when diamond was the
second<00:04:24.810> best<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.200> think<00:04:25.550> something<00:04:26.550> else

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
second best I think something else

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.430 
second best I think something else
because<00:04:26.790> they<00:04:27.000> added<00:04:27.300> more<00:04:27.450> ranks<00:04:27.900> as<00:04:28.140> time

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
because they added more ranks as time

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.680 
because they added more ranks as time
went<00:04:28.620> by<00:04:28.680> but<00:04:29.520> yeah<00:04:29.610> diamond<00:04:30.000> was<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.270> second

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
went by but yeah diamond was the second

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.020 
went by but yeah diamond was the second
best<00:04:31.730> rank<00:04:32.730> in<00:04:33.500> 2010<00:04:34.500> or<00:04:34.770> early<00:04:35.310> 11<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.790> think

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
best rank in 2010 or early 11 I think

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.350 
best rank in 2010 or early 11 I think
and<00:04:36.180> that's<00:04:36.240> when<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.870> grabbed<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.560> few<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.830> my

all this sort of other stuff much more

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.030 
all this sort of other stuff much more
than<00:05:11.780> first-person<00:05:12.780> shooters<00:05:13.170> first-person

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
than first-person shooters first-person

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.460 
than first-person shooters first-person
shooters<00:05:14.340> are<00:05:14.520> just<00:05:14.700> so<00:05:14.880> stressful<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.080> of

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
shooters are just so stressful and of

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.470 
shooters are just so stressful and of
course<00:05:16.710> are<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:16.920> RTS<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.820> end<00:05:17.970> up<00:05:18.060> being<00:05:18.300> that

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
course are the RTS can end up being that

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.050 
course are the RTS can end up being that
way<00:05:18.630> but<00:05:18.690> it's<00:05:19.530> just<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.890> more<00:05:20.100> immersive

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
way but it's just a more immersive

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.910 
way but it's just a more immersive
experience<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:21.810> think<00:05:22.080> then<00:05:22.290> you<00:05:22.800> know

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
experience I think then you know

experience I think then you know
counter-strike<00:05:23.520> match<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.210> lasts<00:05:24.600> what

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
counter-strike match that lasts what

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.110 
counter-strike match that lasts what
like<00:05:25.020> two<00:05:25.290> minutes<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.920> boom<00:05:26.820> boom<00:05:27.000> boom

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
like two minutes and boom boom boom

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.700 
like two minutes and boom boom boom
