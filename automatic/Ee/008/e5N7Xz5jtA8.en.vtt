00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.660
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.360
 Lily Ulanova 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.920
 Now I want to tell you about 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 New Year's cover that really knit 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.429
 I last year for my daughter soon 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.590
 new Year 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.740
 I think that someone has such a cape in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.960
 addition costumes are very suitable now 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.250
 tell you how to connect it so the first thing 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 will need to do this draw a diagram 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.790
 you measure neck circumference like this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 and we will need to spin 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 decide on length 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.200
 the very cape how to do it now 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.440
 show that you have measured under the neck 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:56.280
 I got 28 centimeters to me 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.410
 define here this radius of this 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.120
 small circle for neckline neckline 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.960
 you need 28 centimeters divided by 2 ne-2 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.299
 at at 3.14 we have about 2 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.520
 respectively 6.28 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.220
 when we share it here 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 about four and a half centimeters 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.140
 that is, I can even calculate 28 we 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.729
 divide by 6.28 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.159
 we get 4 45 and so on that is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.689
 about this is four and a half 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:36.650
 a centimeter further you will need 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.350
 determine the size of the cape itself 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.600
 here you need to measure here from the neck to that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.320
 the lengths that you want me are long 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.590
 cape 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.189
 if you want less measure better by 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.890
 elbow 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.079
 that is, are they about the arm, that is, where 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 then let's say the level of your elbow 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.790
 there will be much less centimeters that is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.350
 you are this length 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.759
 measure and accordingly here on 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.280
 scheme do only here from this point 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.469
 you measure the desired length but I have a circle 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.270
 just cut it 40 centimeters on 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.899
 actually from the neck if we are this 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.430
 radius subtract 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.730
 here get thirty five s 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.590
 half centimeters long 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.390
 the very cape here I have 35 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.189
 half centimeters further all 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.379
 just enough, that is, you need to cut 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.439
 two circles, first this big one 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.840
 cut out and then cut out on it 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.989
 small and then cut the resulting 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.109
 detail here in half to cut 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.970
 circle without pattern 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.439
 need to fold the cloth that is you 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.409
 for sure there will be a square or 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.269
 rectangle several times first you 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.150
 fold in half there and then again 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.569
 in half you get here such 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.239
 square 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.430
 then you still fold in half 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.950
 it turns out a triangle in half again and 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.420
 right here when it happens 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.099
 sector you from you measure right here 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.950
 I have a radius of four and a half to 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.840
 this little circle comes out and 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.000
 accordingly , this length is only 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.400
 first you need a big circle to marry you 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.190
 around the house is small and so here you are 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.519
 got the right part and now you 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.459
 I will need to tie her 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.030
 simple enough binding that is 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.510
 start you just need to tie 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.840
 the fabric here is such a mesh fabric 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.449
 I took one hundred percent viscose that is 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.459
 artificial silk and at first just 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:42.940
 tied up 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.510
 This item with single crochets 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.549
 have you start somewhere i recommend 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.299
 from somewhere from here let's say 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.049
 from here 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:55.500
 that is, you started from this point 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.280
 to tie and crochet 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:04.859
 bottom this one bottom then 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:08.079
 climb tied up here this place 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.500
 go down and get to that place 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.780
 where did you start again I repeat 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.400
 usual crochet knit 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.750
 simply enough because 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.750
 fabric and mesh and it is easy to pierce 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.400
 so on the second row I tied such 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.500
 small pattern if possible 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.770
 call that is on the second row I 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.350
 tied beads and knit 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.120
 small chains here somewhere for 5 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.690
 my 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.620
 air loops in one column they 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.570
 are connected that is, I have 3 elements 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.810
 tied in one column to get 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.260
 here are my little faith step 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.030
 about four 5 bars here in 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.100
 different places may be different 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.960
 I watched as I get loose 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.610
 by exactly 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.950
 so that my beads are located 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.100
 symmetrically, that is, right here 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.370
 will die out this distance is better 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:16.220
 count loops and tie here 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:18.560
 Now these elements equally and so still 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.870
 I repeat once, that is, on the second row I 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.240
 I see a bead 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.830
 few crochet without further 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.330
 three chains of 5 air loops 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.390
 bind in one bar is obtained 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.310
 such an element 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:38.240
 few columns a little bead and 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.310
 Next, repeat the pattern of knitting with beads 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.130
 You can look at my site that is 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.670
 here in this work where in principle here 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.840
 All the information you have, you can find 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:53.070
 link bead trim and see how 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.900
 tie beads 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.920
 so now we have a collar on 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:04.390
 collar I have tied a little faith here 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.550
 columns with nakida when you knit here 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.700
 these bars in between also here 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.330
 The center is connected by three chains of air 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.430
 loops and k exactly as here and 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.290
 connected beads between these 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.960
 elements here i'm big bosses not 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:26.070
 used only the little ones all 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:31.210
 same thing on the edge ie in the corner 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:34.330
 capes on top I tied the laces to 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:38.919
 it could be tied at the end 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:41.020
 the cord tied the beads and so 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:44.080
 the laces fit in quite simply 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.270
 have when you got to the corner you knit 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.400
 the chain is the right length that is from that 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.210
 the number of loops you need 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.570
 by lenght 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.990
 at the end tie a bead and then 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.270
 come back knit bollards without nakida 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.270
 that is fairly simple knitting in 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.400
 simple solution if it is so incomprehensible 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:08.229
 look in my accessories section 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:11.140
 There are knitting laces and so on this all 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.590
 that is where you finish knitting you 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.850
 you will only need to carefully remove 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.740
 tail knitting 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.110
 I've shown it many times already 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.930
 done you can see this information 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.000
 on the site and if some information you 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.690
 not enough here on my site 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.070
 there is work here there are images 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.669
 small description of the calculation and information 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.250
 by 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:39.220
 directly about the work itself that is 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:43.240
 how much I knit beads I don't remember exactly 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:46.600
 but somewhere around 30 large and 35 can 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.690
 be as small as needed 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.630
 I can't tell you it depends 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.250
 the size of the cape and from the step with which 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.280
 you will tie the beads all 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:01.060
 other information there are 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.570
 hooks I used you can see 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.570
 Online
