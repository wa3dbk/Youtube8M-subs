00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.530
 for you 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.120
 the book is about the dilemmas 2 well now as a good sign that he has nothing 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.900
 have done the wrong thing 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.660
 loosely based on what happened 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 the incident in barcelona where two boys 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.170
 in an ATM 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.400
 the work starts with having bought other things 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.680
 they are crazy faces 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.850
 but the difference with mine was that he shot 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.020
 two boys were filmed in a very recognizable way, so that the security camera 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.400
 and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
 but it doesn't help you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.310
 I have made them unrecognizable 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.240
 but they all need a little bit 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.810
 well we are working on one 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.750

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.700
 french thomése it goes in 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.090
 The housing market 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.620
 literary review 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.010
 nor was there much 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 and i'm working on 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.770
 at the end of 2010 early 2011 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.570
 the title is 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.330
 summer house with swimming pool 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.960
 I'm just two moving vans 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.359
 but like the quality of life 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.359
 raised to 100 percent healthy body 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.910
 i have an actress nicolette chilenen 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.520
 the actress we put from brussels 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.920
 the economy will have to prove 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.700
 sometimes the air works 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.790
 get beside him 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.790
 Luxembourg 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 always came first 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.899
 a doctor 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.389
 one like jensen has that 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.579
 according to the medical disciplinary board, say due to medical errors by him 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.409
 discovered the disease too late and died 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.039
 but the doctor himself 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.529
 she hopes she 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.639
 marlène deed are advantages for a medical error 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.449
 so will not see that is perhaps intentional 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:34.469
 And then we want to commit as a college 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:35.939
 why a doctor 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.999
 the decision that they should not be patients of them 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.269
 live and let live 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.539
 again a bit of a neck clamp but books yes I do like it 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.419
 I love the wheel and call it not a kind of trademark 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:46.999
 but 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.369
 it actually went without saying that I have I think this is also with me 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.389
 moral dilemma I can go further, among other things, by explaining but the 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.579
 dilemmas are accumulating 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.639
 this is a simple samsung but that will only go from bad to bad 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.639
 worse 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.929
 I think there are even more dilemmas 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.509
 come to work inside
