 obviously tokyo this huge megalopolis offers us one image at a time 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.060
 very contrasting and accurate of Japanese civilization and to go a 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.650
 little further in the heart of stylization we asked today 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.820
 alessandro camara this case who is the author of a book that comes from 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.320
 to publish editions otherwise the whole country the robots the pop culture 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.840
 japanese in the 2 we talk about that culture the first question that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.349
 we do not pose by observing our cover of your book alessandro 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.040
 cecconi voice a younger girl who could look like a doll 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.030
 barbie but who likes something else is the image of Japanese culture 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.740
 modern yes without delay new models kotov lfp percent as well 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.909
 aesthetics 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.390
 he made sense through the milks mandel d'hÃ©rault could easily 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.400
 we are ashamed that we can see as mattresses 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.970
 Japanese girls 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.100
 his soul full of exchanged their image in society 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 and on the interest of proposing news of metaphors 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.730
 social lives does that mean that Japanese society is 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.050
 always of a minimal gas company 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.570
 for example jet lag the company it was called agreement even in society 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.470
 with 13% 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.150
 very machiste and general 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.870
 for many aspects 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.100
 meir% at cams even light then 10 prisons this rite 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.350
 to center my space by the kit in turn in the dance it was 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.340
 consumption because of going to work 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.930
 it's always pleasant mbeki that they brought the powers and outlines 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.520
 of the situation in armed hands in the consumer society the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.530
 young girls filled up without limits 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.219
 when badly the% said to raise the masters of the situation 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.520
 so this just contrasts a little bit with the image that 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.390
 since the silence that the Japanese society through its culture to 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330
 through for example the wearing of the cartoon 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.650
 but what they are 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.620
 arrived for 100 euros beginning of the 80s and who carried a picture 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.080
 pretty violent japan 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.520
 r yes there is violence 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.200
 there is also sex 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.680
 Peter is caught is taken foot posing foot of issenheim 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.010
 that's done 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.039
 but we must also say that Japan 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.760
 cartoon cartoons 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.260
 They are not beautiful knife products intended for France 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.720
 they are products kotov she intended to b i would say to levels 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.230
 age 30 'then in e10 iron and steel 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.970
 so he presented comics that are meant 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.449
 do not use it randomly 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.929
 another housekeeper like that 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:27.129
 in jars I think that's one of the reasons for the interest 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.150
 pfizer also there is a french an italian and rocroi in america the young 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.730
 adults and teenagers gates for the Japanese cartoon the one who 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.819
 is the comic strip I'm learning in Cairo 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.869
 netflix ccb outside 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:47.059
 themes also a little more mature and so also violence and sex s 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.139
 explain the success of mangas for example 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.779
 yes I believe that one paw its scene of the bowling reasons for the success of the 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:53.279
 mannequins 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.249
 because the la la comic was born to it is four to ten 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.769
 weeks you want it 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.599
 to society for 100 th this activity 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.729
 always presented in reality she galy 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.119
 it's a fan tutte 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.549
 while it is my friend why today Japan has not been 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.989
 as a culture that is precisely finding in childhood in some kind of 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.289
 lost paradise 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.489
 those will be different things to those I call year 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.439
 Flemish work 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.629
 because to the assaults of the millions 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.790
 and that's an effect a club club why do you have all the things that are 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.849
 of a fan who is same time as the old dolls and the countries where dear 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.509
 and some way to dress 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.679
 digestive sinks to include start could even using a 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:43.589
 language also a writing for those who are grandchildren and 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.419
 sincerely whole% started in the 70's 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.559
 by the girls 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.579
 what it was to me just in front without asking you must dare 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.480
 the dresses just back but the Japanese society that is to say 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.989
 and I have for some time started to say no I want to test 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.170
 a child 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.189
 I did not grow up and I will not do the things that is done mama 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.579
 so what is the longest of this desire to stay a little bit in the 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.449
 paradise 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.629
 from childhood 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.299
 Is 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.780
 this does not explain at the same time the fascination for a universe 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.359
 technological is precisely 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.989
 is to allow aaa 7 this great highlight 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.120
 the goal is to acquire powers 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.120
 through the modern technology 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.099
 indeed we can see a kind of parallel 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.229
 that is to say, but young girls 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.240
 strong of a leak but the reality through precisely the consumption b 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.770
 do you think afp foot finally from theine 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.580
 the dolls and the sleazy sword it was rare 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.139
 guys are not forced that they will follow a false rhythm 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.860
 fooled the reality 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.710
 reached towards the beach and delahaye technology and science fiction in 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.120

 for 100 euros what is his career and other questions 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.710
 % but it is still a fruit of reality 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.030
 apart from the technology wii because percent of the technology also it 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.730
 can be the greatest happiness 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.249
 a centenary 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.889
 c if we look pose a little there last saga of the giant robots

 he is relieved by a liquid called line like betclic both 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.129
 and it's really amniotic liquid cuddy metaphors 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.669
 as long as there are a lot of biological signs stressed alessandro what 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.189
 it can be said that% and Japanese culture proposing that some sort of 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.189
 response to American culture a kind of anti-Nobel 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.020
 so I'm not going
