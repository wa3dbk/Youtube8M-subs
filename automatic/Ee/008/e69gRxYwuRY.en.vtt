00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hey guys, I'm about to get a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.319
 humble room I will show here the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.200
 my last defense before I can 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.370
 do a little analysis because I'm going 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.199
 being able to do the asset is to earn 250 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.900
 defenses more or less then you can 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.939
 see that I took my father defense from here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.510
 from outside and then in here 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.099
 that's why the guys who are going to use it 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.930
 air raid they will get much more 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 difficult to enter 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.430
 and another cool thing is that if the difference 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.219
 I'm not mistaken, it's in the 4th and serve tome. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.250
 two already left the picture well but more 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 inside so why are you seeing that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.149
 they are a machinist and thanks to a level 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.940
 of my most defensive game he does not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.170
 got pass and took a type text 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 of the animal life 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.989
 but as it goes up chiedi precise 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.449
 buildings more useless here girls 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.239
 these things in my defense intact until 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.809
 now and they go there he will use all 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.400
 the articles in the same place and try 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.820
 invade iraq underneath 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.479
 Only I did not ask until here and how you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.850
 will see 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.400
 he will be unhappy as you have seen him 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.140
 It was hit here for me spirit and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.530
 here too and this simply 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.409
 he annihilated his troops and I won the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.090
 mine actively and now we will get the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.549
 premium of the item before buying the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.689
 another rose 10 and I never spent one 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.189
 penny in this game and I think it is cool 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.270
 a lot more 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.030
 warden let's do this with 50's before 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 and now we are going to buy my room 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.119
 builder and some tips I can give 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.689
 You are not many, it does not mean 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:55.470
 The most important tip I can give 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.710
 It's for you and do not spend with anything. 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.469
 take time man with a force nothing 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.979
 simply have the patience to play a 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:09.869
 play the way he is and expect the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:14.190
 things get ready and always do 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.170
 your assets before always 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.350
 the obstacles that are in your child if 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.440
 Are you looking for the next one and are you leaving? 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.880
 I tell the next builder 2000 so 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.450
 I probably will not be able to 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.590
 next is a lot and it's going to take a while to 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.700

 doing one of them is do not spend and remove the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.440
 obstacles 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.350

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.990

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.380
