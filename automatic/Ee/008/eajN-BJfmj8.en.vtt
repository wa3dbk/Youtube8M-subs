00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
I think Inferno it's kind of like this

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.560 
I think Inferno it's kind of like this
matchup<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.129> lot<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> players<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.180> starting<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
matchup a lot of players are starting to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.170 
matchup a lot of players are starting to
run<00:00:54.870> they're<00:00:55.739> starting<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.670> find<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
run they're starting to kind of find the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.160 
run they're starting to kind of find the
groove<00:00:57.539> front<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.620> infra<00:00:59.280> notes<00:00:59.870> that<00:01:00.870> pretty

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
groove front for infra notes that pretty

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.910 
groove front for infra notes that pretty
much<00:01:01.350> being<00:01:02.989> about<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.199> decision<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
much being about that decision I think I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
much being about that decision I think I
would<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.250> break<00:01:05.640> through<00:01:05.850> sky<00:01:06.119> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
would have just break through sky I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.190 
would have just break through sky I
don't<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> break<00:01:06.990> through

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
don't think I want to break through

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
don't think I want to break through
skill<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.560> wanted<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.220> defense<00:01:08.520> mode<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
skill that I wanted in defense mode it I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.030 
skill that I wanted in defense mode it I
guess<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> doesn't<00:01:10.110> matter<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
guess it doesn't matter all right so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.149 
guess it doesn't matter all right so
he's<00:01:11.159> calling<00:01:11.400> level<00:01:11.610> 2<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.140> it's<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.290> lumina
