00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.049
 well to make our pretty we put 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.270
 water to boil 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.270
 warm come, we add the sugar 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.730
 inside and then the butter 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.030
 as bojan with ready to facilitate that 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.860
 now how many 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.110
 we see a little bit and we are going to work 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.680
 with wood, look at this detail that 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.350
 it is very important 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.090
 we melted and here comes the flour the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.770
 we throw in what is called in blows 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.720
 that is, the whole ship comes this diet 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.010
 and now to remove and remove quickly 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.130
 we have to do this or outside of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 fire or with very low fire that 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.080
 flame scale the flour until when 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.330
 until it clears the walls of the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.940
 You see, you do not have to paste 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.830
 there has to be a meter very well 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.630
 perfect come continue we take it out 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.870
 this pot and we're going to let you 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.850
 quenching 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.130
 because we're going to stop tempering because if 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.480
 let's add something like this is hot 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.490
 that does not set and this we add the eggs 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.170
 I'm going to put the first one this time 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.860
 you see and then I'm going to take the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.920
 second 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.270
 they are going to be five but I tell you, you have to 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.300
 add the eggs one by one because if 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.040
 are going to be five already have it or are not 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.770
 the same is saying I am working with 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.190
 eggs 10 and 63 grams do not work with 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.560
 games 70 and our 5 are less is 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.390
 say that's why we do it and because if 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.460
 we spent on the amount of eggs 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.350
 this has no turning back we were 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.270
 there would be a more liquid mass than the one 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.210
 we want and that would be useless 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.330
 well we add more flour an error is not 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.880
 can not even say it's going to have 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.460
 very careful with the addition of 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.330
 eggs and to what extent do we have to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.660
 Add 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.630
 very well then we are going to put the last 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.520
 because we are reaching density and 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.800
 the texture and see how it shines is 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.320
 It was great, we're already 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
 reaching as you can see and the point is me 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.360
 I would say good that the mass is made 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.460
 rules for tula king you see that falls with 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.270
 difficulty that is the point we already have 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.000
 come to the sleeve in we're going to 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.490
 study you see how that is the dot 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.560
 because because now you see when I go 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.020
 doing what our people are going to do 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.240
 little bombs because they keep their shape 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.240
 hatch with sleeves but you see that no 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.070
 they stretch the cip to the stylized ones and 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.170
 you put baking paper what 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.900
 you want is not to stick to the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.510
 oven tray for inside how many 15 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.580
 meters 110 degrees and then to 180 10 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.770
 minutes more and while it is done let me 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.090
 tell you a little bit this from this 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.380
 kitchen schedules such as permission 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.540
 drive but he gave me permission to

 cook and if you have answering the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.860
 questions is so good is that you should not 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.300
 It feels entertaining and also good 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.730
 then you learn a little cooking 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.680
 trivia about the kitchen three 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.540
 possible answers brand is the one that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.820
 you want me I'm doing it at random 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.830
 Now for you to see that it is very simple 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.250
 we say evaluate 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.540
