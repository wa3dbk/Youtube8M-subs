it's that time where we start to think
is<00:00:20.760> our<00:00:20.939> computer<00:00:21.330> powerful<00:00:21.539> enough<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> run

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
is our computer powerful enough to run

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
is our computer powerful enough to run
these<00:00:22.230> games<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.980> gonna<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.369> these

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
these games are we gonna get these

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
these games are we gonna get these

gaming missing so let's get things

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.180 
gaming missing so let's get things
started<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> case<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
started with the case this is the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.290 
started with the case this is the
corsair<00:00:41.760> 300r<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.100> very<00:00:44.489> nice<00:00:44.850> case

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
corsair 300r and it's very nice case

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.779 
corsair 300r and it's very nice case
very<00:00:46.079> sick<00:00:46.469> looking<00:00:46.680> great<00:00:47.399> build<00:00:47.700> quality

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
very sick looking great build quality

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.479 
very sick looking great build quality
and<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> top<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.280> got

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and as you can see from the top it's got

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
and as you can see from the top it's got
two<00:00:50.730> USB<00:00:51.210> 3<00:00:51.480> ports<00:00:51.899> headphone<00:00:52.500> jack

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
two USB 3 ports headphone jack

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
two USB 3 ports headphone jack
microphone<00:00:53.520> jack<00:00:53.789> obviously<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.570> reset<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
microphone jack obviously your reset and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.779 
microphone jack obviously your reset and
power<00:00:55.230> switch<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:56.160> got<00:00:56.309> lots<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> room

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
power switch it's got lots of room

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.369 
power switch it's got lots of room
inside<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.210> expandability<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
inside for expandability and it's a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
inside for expandability and it's a
great<00:00:58.649> base<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.010> start<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
great base to start with so on the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.330 
great base to start with so on the
motherboard<00:01:01.320> sort<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> things<00:01:01.949> I'm<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
motherboard sort of things I'm going to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.590 
motherboard sort of things I'm going to
suggest<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.820> GA<00:01:03.170> z77<00:01:04.170> ex<00:01:04.949> UD<00:01:05.760> 4h<00:01:06.270> from

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
suggest the GA z77 ex UD 4h from

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.050 
suggest the GA z77 ex UD 4h from
gigabyte<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.890> heard<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> too<00:01:08.189> z77<00:01:08.820> chipset

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
gigabyte as you heard it too z77 chipset

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.480 
gigabyte as you heard it too z77 chipset
and<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:10.260> plenty<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.619> expandability<00:01:11.159> if

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and it's got plenty of expandability if

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
and it's got plenty of expandability if
you<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:11.939> sli<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.720> crossfire<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.710> got

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you want to go sli or crossfire it's got

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
you want to go sli or crossfire it's got
load<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> SATA<00:01:14.400> ports<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.880> board<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
load of SATA ports on board so if you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
load of SATA ports on board so if you
want<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> add<00:01:15.990> plenty<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.619> hard<00:01:16.799> disk<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
want to add plenty of hard disk you can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300 
want to add plenty of hard disk you can
do<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.509> supports<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> 32<00:01:19.380> gig<00:01:19.590> ram<00:01:19.770> it's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
do and it supports up to 32 gig ram it's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.330 
do and it supports up to 32 gig ram it's
a<00:01:20.430> great<00:01:20.700> mother<00:01:21.030> board<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.420> any<00:01:21.570> enthusiast

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
a great mother board for any enthusiast

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.679 
a great mother board for any enthusiast
so<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> processor<00:01:24.119> side<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
so on the processor side I'm going to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.179 
so on the processor side I'm going to
give<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> choice<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.680> we've<00:01:26.159> got

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
give you a choice or two here we've got

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.719 
give you a choice or two here we've got
an<00:01:26.369> i7<00:01:26.810> 3770k<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> great<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.340> gaming

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
an i7 3770k and this is great for gaming

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
an i7 3770k and this is great for gaming
and<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.329> also<00:01:30.540> great<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.229> video<00:01:31.500> editing

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and it's also great for video editing

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.830 
and it's also great for video editing
and<00:01:32.100> also<00:01:32.640> using<00:01:33.060> applications<00:01:33.210> such<00:01:33.810> as

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and also using applications such as

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.710 
and also using applications such as
fraps<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.619> dxtory<00:01:35.340> it'll<00:01:36.030> make<00:01:36.210> use<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
fraps or dxtory it'll make use of the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
fraps or dxtory it'll make use of the
additional<00:01:37.229> virtual<00:01:37.860> cores<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.400> creates

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
additional virtual cores that it creates

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
additional virtual cores that it creates
through<00:01:38.939> hyper<00:01:39.119> threading<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.500> other

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
through hyper threading on the other

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
through hyper threading on the other
side<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> suggest<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.759> 35<00:01:42.180> 70<00:01:42.630> k

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
side I'm going to suggest the 35 70 k

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.990 
side I'm going to suggest the 35 70 k
which<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.200> i5<00:01:43.560> processor<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> also

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
which is an i5 processor this is also

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.760 
which is an i5 processor this is also
great<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.479> gaming<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.229> fine<00:01:46.590> for

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
great for gaming and it's also fine for
