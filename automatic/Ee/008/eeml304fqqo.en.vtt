00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.679 

all<00:00:01.380> right<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.680> would<00:00:01.829> be<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> very<00:00:02.250> small

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689 
all right this would be a very small

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.380 
all right this would be a very small
stop<00:00:03.689> map<00:00:03.870> but<00:00:04.140> I'm<00:00:04.200> gonna<00:00:04.380> try<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.680> again<00:00:05.390> so

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
stop map but I'm gonna try this again so

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.600 
stop map but I'm gonna try this again so
I<00:00:06.420> will<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.930> right<00:00:07.080> back<00:00:07.400> hopefully<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.519> do

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I will be right back hopefully we do

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.470 
I will be right back hopefully we do
much<00:00:08.820> better<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.240> time<00:00:09.740> hopefully<00:00:11.480> well

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
much better this time hopefully well

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.060 
much better this time hopefully well
that<00:00:12.630> time<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.990> enemy<00:00:13.290> didn't<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.590> sabotage

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
that time the enemy didn't do sabotage

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.230 
that time the enemy didn't do sabotage
but<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.340> highly<00:00:14.700> doubt<00:00:14.820> it'll<00:00:15.030> make<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
but I highly doubt it'll make a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.340 
but I highly doubt it'll make a
difference<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:17.119> I'm<00:00:18.119> gonna<00:00:18.270> run<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:18.869> there<00:00:19.050> get

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
difference so I'm gonna run up there get

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.030 
difference so I'm gonna run up there get
that<00:00:19.380> point<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.160> then<00:00:20.850> come<00:00:21.060> back

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.770 

with<00:00:24.640> luck<00:00:24.880> we<00:00:25.060> do<00:00:25.180> a<00:00:25.210> lot<00:00:25.390> better<00:00:25.480> this<00:00:25.720> time

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
with luck we do a lot better this time

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.310 
with luck we do a lot better this time
but<00:00:26.620> who<00:00:27.100> knows<00:00:27.310> it's<00:00:27.580> hard<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.850> say<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:29.230> I'm

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
but who knows it's hard to say so I'm

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.880 
but who knows it's hard to say so I'm
just<00:00:29.410> gonna<00:00:29.530> try<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:29.890> capture<00:00:30.130> points

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
just gonna try and capture points

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.020 
just gonna try and capture points
hopefully<00:00:32.890> we<00:00:33.010> do<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.130> lot<00:00:33.310> better<00:00:33.430> and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
hopefully we do a lot better and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.370 
hopefully we do a lot better and
something<00:00:34.270> I<00:00:34.300> didn't<00:00:34.540> exactly<00:00:34.810> get<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.110> lot<00:00:35.290> of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
something I didn't exactly get a lot of

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.740 
something I didn't exactly get a lot of
killing<00:00:35.770> done<00:00:35.920> last<00:00:36.640> time<00:00:36.790> so<00:00:37.150> maybe<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:37.600> was

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
killing done last time so maybe that was

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.830 
killing done last time so maybe that was
the<00:00:37.870> problem<00:00:39.090> why<00:00:40.090> can't<00:00:40.300> we<00:00:40.360> be<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.540> part<00:00:40.780> of

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
the problem why can't we be a part of

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.000 
the problem why can't we be a part of
that<00:00:40.989> space<00:00:41.260> battle<00:00:41.650> it<00:00:41.950> looks<00:00:42.160> so<00:00:42.370> good

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.740 

hopefully<00:00:48.820> I<00:00:48.879> can<00:00:48.969> capture<00:00:49.359> this<00:00:49.480> nice<00:00:49.719> and

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
hopefully I can capture this nice and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
hopefully I can capture this nice and
quick

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.040
