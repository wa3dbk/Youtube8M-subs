00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.980 

we're<00:00:03.550> now<00:00:03.639> thinking<00:00:03.820> about<00:00:04.029> allergic<00:00:04.540> or

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:04.990 
we're now thinking about allergic or

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.559 
we're now thinking about allergic or
anaphylactic<00:00:05.649> type<00:00:06.130> shock<00:00:06.460> and<00:00:07.240> I<00:00:07.299> think<00:00:07.480> the

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
anaphylactic type shock and I think the

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.690 
anaphylactic type shock and I think the
first<00:00:07.810> thing<00:00:07.960> to<00:00:08.109> say<00:00:08.410> here<00:00:08.740> is<00:00:08.980> that<00:00:09.280> if<00:00:09.580> at

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
first thing to say here is that if at

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.119 
first thing to say here is that if at
all<00:00:09.879> possible<00:00:10.379> identify<00:00:11.379> what<00:00:11.650> has<00:00:11.799> caused

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
all possible identify what has caused

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.789 
all possible identify what has caused
the<00:00:12.520> allergic<00:00:13.059> reaction<00:00:13.570> and<00:00:13.750> remove<00:00:14.529> that

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
the allergic reaction and remove that

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.700 
the allergic reaction and remove that
cause<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:16.150> if<00:00:16.359> you're<00:00:16.510> giving<00:00:16.869> a<00:00:16.960> drug<00:00:17.140> violent

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
cause so if you're giving a drug violent

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.950 
cause so if you're giving a drug violent
infusion<00:00:18.279> and<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.939> patient<00:00:19.359> starts<00:00:19.720> to<00:00:19.750> have

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
infusion and the patient starts to have

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.650 
infusion and the patient starts to have
some<00:00:19.990> anaphylactic<00:00:20.890> type<00:00:21.310> reaction<00:00:21.880> even<00:00:22.390> if

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
some anaphylactic type reaction even if

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.269 
some anaphylactic type reaction even if
you're<00:00:22.810> not<00:00:23.230> sure<00:00:23.410> whether<00:00:23.650> it's<00:00:23.890> that<00:00:24.009> drug

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
you're not sure whether it's that drug

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.400 
you're not sure whether it's that drug
or<00:00:24.429> not<00:00:24.699> of<00:00:24.939> course<00:00:24.970> stop<00:00:25.630> it<00:00:25.810> just<00:00:26.050> in<00:00:26.199> case

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
or not of course stop it just in case

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.849 
or not of course stop it just in case
et's<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.820> remove<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.539> cause<00:00:28.779> if<00:00:29.169> possible

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
et's so remove the cause if possible

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.190 
et's so remove the cause if possible
take<00:00:30.429> them<00:00:30.640> out<00:00:30.909> of<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.359> environment<00:00:31.689> where

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
take them out of the environment where

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.100 
take them out of the environment where
the<00:00:32.410> allergen<00:00:32.980> is<00:00:33.310> and<00:00:33.820> hopefully<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.990> will

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
the allergen is and hopefully that will

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.340 
the allergen is and hopefully that will
stop<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.620> reaction<00:00:35.920> getting<00:00:36.460> any<00:00:36.670> worse<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
stop the reaction getting any worse so

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.730 
stop the reaction getting any worse so
remove<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:38.830> cause<00:00:39.040> if<00:00:39.340> possible<00:00:40.170> now<00:00:41.170> in

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
remove the cause if possible now in

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.640 
remove the cause if possible now in
another<00:00:41.980> phylactery<00:00:42.580> reaction<00:00:43.290> many<00:00:44.290> mast

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
another phylactery reaction many mast

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.630 
another phylactery reaction many mast
cells<00:00:45.810> bring<00:00:46.810> about<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.350> mass<00:00:47.680> release<00:00:48.310> of

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
cells bring about a mass release of

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.750 
cells bring about a mass release of
histamine<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.590> histamine<00:00:50.590> is<00:00:50.830> a<00:00:51.130> vasodilator

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
histamine and histamine is a vasodilator

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.630 
histamine and histamine is a vasodilator
it<00:00:52.690> dilates<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.290> blood<00:00:53.380> vessels<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.310> it's

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
it dilates the blood vessels and it's

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.900 
it dilates the blood vessels and it's
also<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:55.060> bronco<00:00:55.690> constrictor<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:57.070> closes<00:00:57.670> down

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
also a bronco constrictor it closes down

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.530 
also a bronco constrictor it closes down
the<00:00:58.360> bronchial<00:00:58.900> passages<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.150> patient

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
the bronchial passages so the patient

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.270 
the bronchial passages so the patient
has<00:01:01.570> these<00:01:01.840> two<00:01:02.140> problems<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.710> peripheral

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
has these two problems the peripheral

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.950 
has these two problems the peripheral
basal<00:01:03.670> dilation<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.420> the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
basal dilation and the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.190 
basal dilation and the
bronchoconstriction<00:01:07.200> unfortunately

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
bronchoconstriction unfortunately

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.959 
bronchoconstriction unfortunately
there's<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.469> drug<00:01:08.740> which<00:01:08.979> does<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.520> exact

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
there's a drug which does the exact

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.200 
there's a drug which does the exact
opposite<00:01:10.799> adrenaline<00:01:11.799> and<00:01:12.159> epinephrine<00:01:12.579> is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
opposite adrenaline and epinephrine is

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.450 
opposite adrenaline and epinephrine is
exactly<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:13.899> same<00:01:14.049> thing<00:01:14.369> epinephrine<00:01:15.369> is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
exactly the same thing epinephrine is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.289 
exactly the same thing epinephrine is
the<00:01:15.579> American<00:01:16.090> name<00:01:16.299> and<00:01:17.460> adrenaline<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.969> they

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
the American name and adrenaline is they

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.910 
the American name and adrenaline is they
vaso<00:01:20.109> constricting<00:01:21.780> bronchodilator<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.799> it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
vaso constricting bronchodilator so it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.760 
vaso constricting bronchodilator so it
does<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.280> exact<00:01:24.700> opposite<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:26.229> histamine

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
does the exact opposite of the histamine

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.950 
does the exact opposite of the histamine
it<00:01:27.219> exactly<00:01:27.729> counteracts<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.539> effects

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
it exactly counteracts the effects

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.779 
it exactly counteracts the effects
counteracts<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.679> effects<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.249> histamine

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
counteracts the effects of the histamine

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.099 
counteracts the effects of the histamine
so<00:01:31.749> the<00:01:31.899> histamine<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.560> causing<00:01:33.069> vasodilation

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
so the histamine is causing vasodilation

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.700 
so the histamine is causing vasodilation
the<00:01:35.109> adrenaline<00:01:35.710> causes<00:01:35.950> vasoconstriction

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the adrenaline causes vasoconstriction

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.919 
the adrenaline causes vasoconstriction
reversing<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.859> effect<00:01:39.389> the<00:01:40.389> histamine

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
reversing that effect the histamine

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.319 
reversing that effect the histamine
causes<00:01:41.009> bronchoconstriction<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
causes bronchoconstriction the

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.879 
causes bronchoconstriction the
adrenaline<00:01:43.929> causes<00:01:44.229> bronco<00:01:45.359> dilation<00:01:46.359> and

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
adrenaline causes bronco dilation and

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.499 
adrenaline causes bronco dilation and
that<00:01:47.889> can<00:01:48.069> be<00:01:48.189> given<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.609> a<00:01:48.700> dose<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.119> naught

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
that can be given in a dose of naught

then<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.400> absorbed<00:02:53.970> nice<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.510> slowly<00:02:54.750> of

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
the muscle if you can just draw back if

the muscle if you can just draw back if
it's<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.570> an<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.750> EpiPen<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.680> draw<00:03:01.920> back<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
it's not an in EpiPen just draw back to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.860 
it's not an in EpiPen just draw back to
make<00:03:02.700> sure<00:03:02.910> you're<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.150> getting<00:03:03.330> any<00:03:03.570> blood

make sure you're not getting any blood

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.070 
make sure you're not getting any blood
so<00:03:04.500> there's<00:03:04.739> no<00:03:04.890> possibility<00:03:05.670> of

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
so there's no possibility of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.720 
so there's no possibility of
intravascular<00:03:07.370> administration<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.580> it's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
intravascular administration so it's

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.820 
intravascular administration so it's
intramuscular<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.840> then<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.560> will<00:03:10.709> just

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
intramuscular and then it will just

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.120 
intramuscular and then it will just
dissolve<00:03:11.070> out<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> right<00:03:12.390> rate<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:13.470> to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
dissolve out just the right rate to to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.250 
dissolve out just the right rate to to

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
injection now what are the problems with

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.640 
injection now what are the problems with
anaphylactic<00:03:48.000> reactions<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.079> the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
anaphylactic reactions is that the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.880 
anaphylactic reactions is that the
adrenaline<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.700> wear<00:03:50.940> off<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.769> give

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
adrenaline can wear off so you can give

adrenaline can wear off so you can give
the<00:03:53.040> adrenaline<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.790> patient<00:03:54.180> might<00:03:54.329> be<00:03:54.510> much

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
the adrenaline the patient might be much

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.750 
the adrenaline the patient might be much
better<00:03:54.959> than<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.010> think<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.340> that's<00:03:56.489> good

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
better than you think all that's good

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.490 
better than you think all that's good
the<00:03:56.880> patient's<00:03:57.269> better<00:03:57.420> off<00:03:57.720> that's<00:03:58.170> finished

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
the patient's better off that's finished

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.430 
the patient's better off that's finished
now<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.160> it's<00:03:59.280> not<00:03:59.900> because<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
now but it's not because the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.220 
now but it's not because the
anaphylactic<00:04:02.400> reaction<00:04:03.150> from<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.780> initial

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
anaphylactic reaction from that initial

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.789 
anaphylactic reaction from that initial
trigger<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:05.459> recur<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.780> can<00:04:07.079> recur

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
trigger can recur it can recur

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.789 
trigger can recur it can recur
so<00:04:08.280> it's<00:04:08.400> give<00:04:08.579> hydrocortisone<00:04:09.799> 200

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
so it's give hydrocortisone 200

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.560 
so it's give hydrocortisone 200
