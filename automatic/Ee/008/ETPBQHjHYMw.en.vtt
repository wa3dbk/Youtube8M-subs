much<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.530> Ben<00:02:07.950> Xia<00:02:08.280> player<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.479> mean<00:02:09.659> he<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
much a Ben Xia player like I mean he is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.589 
much a Ben Xia player like I mean he is
left<00:02:10.500> footed<00:02:10.769> Penzias<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> but

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
left footed Penzias right for it but

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.020 
left footed Penzias right for it but
those<00:02:12.870> two<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.590> pretty<00:02:14.010> much<00:02:14.250> same

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
those two have pretty much same

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030 
those two have pretty much same
statistics<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.260> skill<00:02:16.500> attributes

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
statistics in the skill attributes

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.970 
statistics in the skill attributes
because<00:02:17.490> Berardi<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.510> really<00:02:18.870> able<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.950> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
because Berardi is really able to do a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.010 
because Berardi is really able to do a
finesse<00:02:20.730> from<00:02:21.330> anywhere

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
finesse from anywhere

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.440 
finesse from anywhere
the<00:02:22.140> pitch<00:02:22.380> Ben<00:02:22.890> Xia<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.910> they<00:02:24.330> have

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the pitch Ben Xia as well and they have

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.540 
the pitch Ben Xia as well and they have
a<00:02:24.540> great<00:02:24.810> shot<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.320> them<00:02:25.560> great<00:02:25.920> pace

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
a great shot on them great pace

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.000 
a great shot on them great pace
the<00:02:26.790> only<00:02:26.970> thing<00:02:27.300> Ben<00:02:27.540> Xia<00:02:27.720> has<00:02:27.990> over<00:02:28.470> Berardi

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the only thing Ben Xia has over Berardi

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.850 
the only thing Ben Xia has over Berardi
is<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.760> star<00:02:30.120> skills<00:02:30.450> Bharani<00:02:30.900> only<00:02:31.320> has<00:02:31.470> 3

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
is for star skills Bharani only has 3

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.640 
is for star skills Bharani only has 3
star<00:02:32.160> skills<00:02:32.490> but<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.660> wouldn't<00:02:33.960> compare<00:02:34.380> both

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
star skills but I wouldn't compare both

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.340 
star skills but I wouldn't compare both
because<00:02:35.130> there<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.460> D<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.940> mainly<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.720> winger

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
because there are D is mainly a winger

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.160 
because there are D is mainly a winger
and<00:02:37.560> he<00:02:38.100> will<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.730> good<00:02:39.120> time<00:02:39.180> playing<00:02:39.900> him

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and he will have a good time playing him

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.190 
and he will have a good time playing him
on<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.710> wing<00:02:41.010> because<00:02:41.490> there<00:02:42.420> are<00:02:42.570> not<00:02:42.870> too

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
on that wing because there are not too

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.310 
on that wing because there are not too
many<00:02:43.230> winners<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.370> course<00:02:44.940> right<00:02:45.480> wingers<00:02:45.990> out

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
many winners of course right wingers out

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.700
