we<00:00:41.890> as<00:00:42.039> eye<00:00:42.339> doctors<00:00:42.910> give<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.149> prescription

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
we as eye doctors give a prescription

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.139 
we as eye doctors give a prescription
and<00:00:44.109> we<00:00:44.320> specify<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.219> prescription<00:00:45.969> in<00:00:46.089> a

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
and we specify the prescription in a

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.880 
and we specify the prescription in a
horizontal<00:00:46.480> meridian<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.649> vertical

horizontal meridian and a vertical
meridian<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:49.449> means<00:00:49.749> we<00:00:50.050> have<00:00:50.350> two

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
meridian and that means we have two

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.970 
meridian and that means we have two
planes<00:00:51.519> that<00:00:51.909> were<00:00:52.149> attacking<00:00:52.749> and<00:00:53.140> then<00:00:53.620> we

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
planes that were attacking and then we

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.750 
planes that were attacking and then we
are<00:00:54.249> telling<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.300> lab<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:56.019> put<00:00:56.260> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
are telling the lab to put it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.360 
are telling the lab to put it
specifically<00:00:57.760> like<00:00:58.149> on<00:00:58.359> a<00:00:58.390> fuck<00:00:58.690> dial<00:00:59.370> 180

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
specifically like on a fuck dial 180

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.719 
specifically like on a fuck dial 180
degrees<00:01:00.879> somewhere<00:01:01.390> in<00:01:02.050> what<00:01:02.679> position<00:01:03.309> that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
degrees somewhere in what position that

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.149 
degrees somewhere in what position that
is<00:01:03.909> necessary<00:01:04.449> for<00:01:04.690> you<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:04.839> see<00:01:05.110> better<00:01:05.350> when

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
is necessary for you to see better when

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.070 
is necessary for you to see better when
you<00:01:06.280> have<00:01:06.490> surgery<00:01:06.970> done<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.570> benefit<00:01:08.050> of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
you have surgery done the benefit of

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.320 
you have surgery done the benefit of
that<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.860> if<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.430> take<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> look<00:01:09.940> at<00:01:10.180> this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
that is if you take a look at this

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.220 
that is if you take a look at this
tomato<00:01:11.230> and<00:01:11.590> pretended<00:01:12.010> your<00:01:12.430> eye<00:01:12.460> if<00:01:13.450> you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
tomato and pretended your eye if you

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.670 
tomato and pretended your eye if you
have<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:14.800> prescription<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:17.290> little<00:01:17.560> bit

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
have a prescription that is a little bit

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.710 
have a prescription that is a little bit
more<00:01:17.860> complicated<00:01:18.280> meaning<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.210> this

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
more complicated meaning that this

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.350 
more complicated meaning that this
meridian<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:21.040> meridian<00:01:21.670> are<00:01:21.910> not<00:01:22.180> your

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
meridian and this meridian are not your

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.290 
meridian and this meridian are not your
only<00:01:22.600> problems<00:01:23.080> maybe<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.650> have<00:01:23.890> issues<00:01:24.300> over

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
only problems maybe you have issues over

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.710 
only problems maybe you have issues over
here<00:01:25.750> or<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.800> over<00:01:27.010> here<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.670> surgeon<00:01:28.540> can

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
here or and over here a surgeon can

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.080 
here or and over here a surgeon can
actually<00:01:29.170> fix<00:01:29.440> those<00:01:29.800> with<00:01:30.160> surgery<00:01:30.670> because

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
actually fix those with surgery because

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.450 
actually fix those with surgery because
of<00:01:31.120> wavefront<00:01:31.960> technology<00:01:32.650> it<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.430> a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
of wavefront technology it is a

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.620 
of wavefront technology it is a
technology<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.570> utilizes<00:01:35.790> beam<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:37.450> go

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
technology that utilizes beam to go

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.220 
technology that utilizes beam to go
through<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.380> analyze<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:39.370> exact<00:01:40.230> topography

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
through and analyze the exact topography

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.590 
through and analyze the exact topography
of<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.560> front<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:41.980> your<00:01:42.160> on<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.150> means

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
of the front of your on so that means

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.560 
of the front of your on so that means
that<00:01:44.140> if<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:45.070> have<00:01:45.490> for<00:01:45.910> instance<00:01:45.940> i'm<00:01:46.450> going

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
that if you have for instance i'm going

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.500 
that if you have for instance i'm going
to<00:01:46.660> create<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:46.960> dent<00:01:47.350> okay<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.040> this<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.270> dead

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
to create a dent okay and this is a dead

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.040 
to create a dent okay and this is a dead
now

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
now

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.690 
now
i<00:01:50.080> don't<00:01:50.530> know<00:01:50.620> if<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:50.770> can<00:01:50.950> see<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.520> see

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
i don't know if you can see that you see

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700 
i don't know if you can see that you see
that<00:01:51.730> dent<00:01:52.150> right<00:01:52.420> there<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:52.870> i<00:01:52.900> created<00:01:53.380> I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
that dent right there that i created I

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.880 
that dent right there that i created I
created<00:01:54.400> this<00:01:54.640> divot<00:01:55.480> right<00:01:55.690> in<00:01:55.870> here<00:01:56.140> if<00:01:56.350> you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
created this divot right in here if you

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.690 
created this divot right in here if you
came<00:01:57.160> in<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.580> me<00:01:57.790> as<00:01:58.030> an<00:01:58.270> eye<00:01:58.360> doctor<00:01:58.390> with<00:01:59.350> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
came in to me as an eye doctor with a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.190 
came in to me as an eye doctor with a
depression<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.090> on<00:02:01.360> your<00:02:01.570> eye<00:02:01.750> I

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
depression like that on your eye I

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.860 
depression like that on your eye I
wouldn't<00:02:02.920> be<00:02:03.010> able<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.280> utilize<00:02:03.790> glasses<00:02:04.690> in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
wouldn't be able to utilize glasses in

wouldn't be able to utilize glasses in
order<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.230> fix<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:05.860> dent<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.580> probably<00:02:06.880> would

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
order to fix that dent I probably would

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.559 
order to fix that dent I probably would
have<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.810> utilize<00:02:08.500> hard<00:02:09.250> contact<00:02:09.640> lens<00:02:10.300> in

now follow me on this I'm going to bring
up<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.710> picture<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.460> wavefront<00:02:34.150> technology

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
up a picture of the wavefront technology

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.160 
up a picture of the wavefront technology
and<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.680> an<00:02:35.800> eye<00:02:36.000> facing<00:02:37.000> upward<00:02:37.480> almost

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
and it is of an eye facing upward almost

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.350 
and it is of an eye facing upward almost
as<00:02:38.320> if<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.620> person's<00:02:39.010> laying<00:02:39.220> down<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
as if the person's laying down the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.390 
as if the person's laying down the
wavefront<00:02:40.810> technology<00:02:41.560> being<00:02:41.800> comes<00:02:42.130> onto

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
wavefront technology being comes onto

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.910 
wavefront technology being comes onto
the<00:02:42.580> top<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.570> creates<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.050> topographical

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
the top of it it creates a topographical

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.530 
the top of it it creates a topographical
map<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.459> you're<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.820> see<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.180> based

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
map and you're going to see that based

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.480 
map and you're going to see that based
with<00:02:46.840> colors<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.680> show<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.160> steepness

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
with colors to show you the steepness

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.090 
with colors to show you the steepness
and<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.690> flatness<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.650> different<00:02:50.830> areas

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
and the flatness and in different areas

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.220 
and the flatness and in different areas
so<00:02:51.490> take<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> look<00:02:52.150> at<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:52.420> picture<00:02:52.660> coming<00:02:53.020> up

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
so take a look at this picture coming up

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.059 
so take a look at this picture coming up
you<00:02:54.220> might<00:02:54.430> want<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> even<00:02:54.850> pause<00:02:55.090> it

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.770 

umm<00:02:59.430> now<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.849> you've<00:02:59.970> seen<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.180> picture<00:03:00.689> of

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
umm now that you've seen that picture of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.920 
umm now that you've seen that picture of
wavefront<00:03:01.230> technology<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.549> great<00:03:03.120> when<00:03:03.569> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
wavefront technology it's great when the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.089 
wavefront technology it's great when the
surgery

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
surgery

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.520 
surgery
turns<00:03:05.519> out<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.090> laser<00:03:06.299> surgery<00:03:06.569> turns<00:03:07.110> out<00:03:07.349> to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
turns out the laser surgery turns out to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.559 
turns out the laser surgery turns out to
correct<00:03:07.799> every<00:03:08.220> little<00:03:08.519> nuance<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.299> front

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
correct every little nuance on the front

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.420 
correct every little nuance on the front
of<00:03:09.659> your<00:03:09.840> eye<00:03:09.989> because<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:11.129> can<00:03:11.400> actually

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
of your eye because that can actually

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.809 
of your eye because that can actually
create<00:03:12.180> better<00:03:13.110> vision<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.280> then<00:03:14.519> I

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
create better vision for you then I

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.690 
create better vision for you then I
could<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:15.420> an<00:03:15.540> eye<00:03:15.659> doctor<00:03:16.129> prescribing<00:03:17.129> you<00:03:17.370> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
could as an eye doctor prescribing you a

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.309 
could as an eye doctor prescribing you a
pair<00:03:17.909> of<00:03:17.940> glasses<00:03:18.299> if<00:03:18.659> you<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.959> put<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.260> on

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
pair of glasses if you just put it on

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.580 
pair of glasses if you just put it on
like<00:03:19.379> this<00:03:19.620> or<00:03:20.250> maybe<00:03:20.760> even<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.690> soft<00:03:22.019> contact

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
like this or maybe even a soft contact

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.190 
like this or maybe even a soft contact
plant<00:03:22.890> or<00:03:23.250> maybe<00:03:23.519> even<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.760> hard<00:03:23.940> lens<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
plant or maybe even a hard lens but the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.770 
plant or maybe even a hard lens but the
con<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:26.159> it<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.430> there's<00:03:26.849> you<00:03:27.150> know<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.480> other

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
con of it is there's you know the other

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.679 
con of it is there's you know the other
side<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.439> situation<00:03:29.129> if<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.359> have

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
side of the situation if you have

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.940 
side of the situation if you have
surgery<00:03:31.470> done<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:33.569> front<00:03:34.319> surface<00:03:34.680> of

surgery done and the front surface of
your<00:03:35.489> eye<00:03:35.819> is<00:03:36.269> operated<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.409> perfectly

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
your eye is operated on perfectly

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.599 
your eye is operated on perfectly
correctly<00:03:39.030> as<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.450> should<00:03:39.750> but<00:03:40.609> unfortunately

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
correctly as it should but unfortunately

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.330 
correctly as it should but unfortunately
a<00:03:41.819> few<00:03:42.180> weeks<00:03:42.389> later<00:03:42.629> or<00:03:43.019> maybe<00:03:43.260> even<00:03:43.409> a<00:03:44.280> couple

a few weeks later or maybe even a couple

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.479 
a few weeks later or maybe even a couple
of<00:03:44.730> years<00:03:44.790> later<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:46.079> eye<00:03:46.349> pressure<00:03:46.859> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
pressure inside of your eye itself is

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.069 
pressure inside of your eye itself is
you<00:03:50.129> know<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.639> pressure<00:03:51.120> that's<00:03:51.840> what

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
you know we have pressure that's what

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.449 
you know we have pressure that's what
makes<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.440> nice<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.650> round<00:03:52.950> kind<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
makes it nice and round kind of like a

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.569 
makes it nice and round kind of like a
balloon<00:03:53.849> that<00:03:54.120> eye<00:03:54.840> pressure<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.950> sometimes

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
balloon that eye pressure can sometimes

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.599 
balloon that eye pressure can sometimes
cause<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.510> front<00:03:57.780> surface<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.349> your<00:03:58.950> eye<00:03:59.159> to

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
cause the front surface of your eye to

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.629 
cause the front surface of your eye to
come<00:04:00.359> out<00:04:00.510> warped<00:04:01.079> over<00:04:01.680> time<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.430> that

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
come out warped over time and that

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.240 
come out warped over time and that
happens<00:04:03.180> because<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:04.319> front<00:04:04.590> surface<00:04:05.069> of

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
happens because the front surface of

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.569 
happens because the front surface of
your<00:04:05.459> eye<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:06.209> no<00:04:06.480> longer<00:04:06.989> as<00:04:07.169> thick<00:04:08.129> as<00:04:08.459> it

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
your eye is no longer as thick as it

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.559 
your eye is no longer as thick as it
used<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.849> be<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.780> when<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.680> thinner<00:04:11.160> than

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569

what<00:04:13.019> ends<00:04:13.319> up<00:04:13.410> happening<00:04:13.699> possibly<00:04:14.699> is<00:04:14.910> that

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
what ends up happening possibly is that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.400 
what ends up happening possibly is that
the<00:04:15.690> pressure<00:04:15.989> causes<00:04:16.799> an<00:04:17.329> uneven<00:04:18.329> type<00:04:19.049> of

pressure<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.849> certain<00:04:21.389> areas<00:04:21.930> creating<00:04:22.440> a

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
pressure in certain areas creating a

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.939 
pressure in certain areas creating a
distorted<00:04:23.220> eye<00:04:23.490> again<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:24.900> having<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.500> second

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
distorted eye again so having a second

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.250 
distorted eye again so having a second
surgery<00:04:26.099> to<00:04:26.460> fix<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.940> problem<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.720> out<00:04:28.199> of

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
surgery to fix that problem is out of

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.600 
surgery to fix that problem is out of
the<00:04:28.470> question<00:04:28.680> because<00:04:29.010> you're<00:04:29.220> just<00:04:29.460> going

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
the question because you're just going

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.820 
the question because you're just going
to<00:04:29.729> thin<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:29.970> out<00:04:30.150> even<00:04:30.539> more<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:31.050> cause<00:04:31.590> the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
to thin it out even more and cause the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.370 
to thin it out even more and cause the
possibility<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:33.330> front<00:04:33.750> surface<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.199> your

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
possibility of the front surface of your

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.150 
possibility of the front surface of your
eye<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.470> get<00:04:34.770> even<00:04:35.010> more<00:04:35.190> tweaked<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:37.160> surgery

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
eye to get even more tweaked so surgery

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.490 
eye to get even more tweaked so surgery
is<00:04:38.310> not<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:39.030> second<00:04:39.389> surgery<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.960> usually<00:04:40.199> not

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
is not the second surgery is usually not

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.950 
is not the second surgery is usually not
the<00:04:40.860> answer<00:04:41.340> in<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.490> case<00:04:41.849> then<00:04:42.510> when<00:04:42.720> you<00:04:42.840> go

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
the answer in that case then when you go

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.230 
the answer in that case then when you go
in<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.260> see<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.530> eye<00:04:43.560> doctor<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:44.729> eye<00:04:44.760> doctor

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
in to see the eye doctor the eye doctor

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.730 
in to see the eye doctor the eye doctor
has<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.449> problem<00:04:45.930> because<00:04:46.080> if<00:04:46.380> they<00:04:46.500> try<00:04:46.710> to

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740
