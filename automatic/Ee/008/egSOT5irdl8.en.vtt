00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 somehow I can not make it up 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.890
 twitter three children came lewerenz gta 5 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.900
 and many more games to look forward to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.500
 I constantly have to go to my lot too 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.360
 weak graphics card think what you are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.920
 it is similar yes then I welcome you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.570
 heartily to the graphics cards 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 buying advice for the first and second 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.550
 quarter 2015 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.210
 this buying advice starts from about 100 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.760
 euro 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.359
 well for about 80 euros, there are synonymous 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 already the hs nr 7 250 iks with one 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.440
 gigabyte very fast gddr5 memory 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.510
 that's how games like minecraft do it 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.579
 league of legends and cs go extreme 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800
 liquid the 80 years are really good 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.790
 invested and spend less 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 I definitely do not 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 now we would be already at the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.870
 interesting graphics cards arrived 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.350
 for under 110 euro, there are already the hs 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.850
 he raiden 7 260 the beautiful thing about this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.000
 graphics card that is already over 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 has two gigabytes of gddr5 memory and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.649
 the connections can also see each other 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.859
 to let 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.030
 displayport hdmi and twice dvi clear 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.339
 she wins no beauty contest 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 but the performance can really see itself 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.880
 let in current games like 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 Battlefield 4 gets on the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 maximum settings and one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 resolution of full hd just under 40 pictures in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.259
 the second for just under 30 euros more 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.580
 at a price of around 135 euros there 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.799
 it's already the hs nr 7 265 in the battlefield 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.439
 4 she reaches a good ten more pictures in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.329
 the second as the rather 7,260 ickx and 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.820
 beats itself in the phenomenal 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.070
 resolution of 2560 x 1440 will be over 30 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.439
 pictures in the second really good at the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.090
 price really impressive finally 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.070
 There is also one of nvidia one here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 worthwhile alternative and that the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.170
 pellet gtx 750 de store mix 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.380
 she is a bit weaker than that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.610
 rather 7 265 consumes so little 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.799
 Do not even stream it 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.140
 power plug needed it relates to the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.079
 whole stream through the pci express slot 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.969
 and who knows the gtx 750i knows that 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.860
 They play very well in current games 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.619
 then the next card beats 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.770
 already for only 20 euro more I may 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.480
 imagine 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.550
 the hs nr 9 270 iks for under 160 euro 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.530
 you get a gpu yourself here 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.710
 crysis 3 on the maximum employment and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.170
 a resolution of full hd with about 40 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.590
 fps shop battlefield 4 at the same 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.040
 setting even almost 60 fps no 20 euro 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.080
 more cost these parades again 280 me 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.480
 would almost say that this card 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.730
 so slowly but surely in the high end 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.370
 area already goes by the three alone 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.910
 gb gddr5 memory can see each other 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.750
 to let 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.570
 I say only 67 fps in b 4 at one 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.270
 resolution of full hd itself 2 ks no 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.150
 problem then it is still over 42 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.110
 fps we come to a video card the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.590
 Much is criticized for msi gtx 960 them 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.110
 costs 35 euros more cn and 280 and has 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.180
 a gigabyte of gddr5 memory has less 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.010
 does not sound like a good deal 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.050
 why I recommend her then there she was 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.200
 but he still has two gigabytes of memory 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.750
 now 280 in battlefield 4 with just under 10 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.360
 FPS over offers also needed this 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.060
 Map very little stream and is extreme 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.050
 quietly less criticized is this 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.650
 celebration he raiden 9 280 extreme xii for 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.690
 just under 245 euros she reached even in 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.320
 hardware hungry games like crysis 3 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.920
 over 50 fps and about 5 ps more 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.140
 as the gtx 960 do a lot wrong with 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.240
 the card is not a small drawback 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.400
 But there are some with theirs 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.140
 she is a bit tall and three fans 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.740
 no longer fits in any housing 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.470
 purely 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.720
 the next gpu is undoubtedly one 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.780
 high end graphics card and this is this 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.910
 celebration raiden again 290 tricks out of her 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.340
 here brings really impressive 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.300
 achievements far in excess of 90 apps 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.580
 battlefield 4 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.740
 even in a resolution of 2k are 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.370
 We still have over 60 pictures in the 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.440
 second 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.110
 it requires a relatively large amount of power though 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.670
 for that the cooler works fine but now 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.470
 we come to a video card at the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.480
 I first explain a little something 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.819
 but first has a few facts 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.299
 It costs around 35 euros more 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.400
 1990 and thus comes to 333 euros 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.430
 These are the super g 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.139
 tx 970 now maybe he wonders 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.560
 one or the other what I explain here 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.120
 want 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.949
 but I'm sure many know 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.440
 already what I want out and that 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:36.009
 on the 35 gb was or 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.139
 scandal the 970 can only 35 out of four 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.789
 gigabyte is driving this is whole 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.800
 Conscious was the customer 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.169
 now it is up to you if you say fraud 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.820
 back and forth these 0 5 gb do the 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.889
 card not even worse or you 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.199
 I denied this card 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.090
 understand both, however you 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.550
 you decide the 970 is one 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.680
 strong gpu besides, this day is pretty 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.349
 small and has many connections 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.060
 Added to this is the low power consumption 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.340
 the next ticket costs around 60 euros 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.740
 But that's more than that 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.530
 it is this celebration raiden and 290th 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.960
 extreme xii she even creates crysis 3 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.509
 on the maximum settings with just under 70 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.580
 Of course she has fps again as well 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.070
 the good tricks cooler installed 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.070
 for almost 100 euros more there is the 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.229
 msi gtx 980 she is for her 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.330
 performance class pretty small 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.509
 Also it creates on battlefield 4 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.370
 with the maximum settings 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.409
 incredible 120 fps 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.130
 However, you have to keep in mind that the 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.729
 gtx 970 is about 150 euro cheaper and 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.380
 the card is only about 5 fps slower 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.750
 is he really meant for that 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.270
 want to invest in their pc all 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.740
 I would rather advise others to 970 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.300
 I would still like to become one 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.919
 I do not get the graphics card 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.750
 However, like to recommend directly 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.810
 I would talk about it 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.280
 this celebration is nearing us from 95 2 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.740
 This card is a real monster 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.340
 which itself ready for gaming in 4k 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.229
 would 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.030
 However, I can do this as at the beginning 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.830
 Not really recommended because they say 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.810
 not only needs a lot of space 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.830
 but because of their high 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.139
 electricity consumption 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.960
 For that you need a real monster 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.699
 network 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.990
 In addition, it costs a proud 720 euros 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.970
 so you're back for today 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.860
 I hope the whole thing has been 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.900
 you like me and that I am with you 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.940
 help choosing your next video card 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.050
 otherwise I wish you 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.150
 this one still make a beautiful 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.190
 day and I hope that we in 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.960
 Seeing people again next time will do it 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.960
 good and see you next time
