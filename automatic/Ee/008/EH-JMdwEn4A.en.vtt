00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

so<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.599> is<00:00:00.630> an<00:00:00.900> interesting<00:00:01.290> theory<00:00:01.709> which

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so this is an interesting theory which

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.039 
so this is an interesting theory which
you<00:00:02.550> know<00:00:02.669> just<00:00:02.879> randomly<00:00:03.360> came<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.780> my<00:00:03.870> head

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
you know just randomly came to my head

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.170 
you know just randomly came to my head
there<00:00:04.350> are<00:00:04.440> two<00:00:04.680> parts<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.190> theory<00:00:05.460> there

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
there are two parts to the theory there

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.509 
there are two parts to the theory there
are<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:06.779> part<00:00:06.990> which<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.770> know<00:00:07.890> many<00:00:08.130> people

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
are one part which you know many people

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.100 
are one part which you know many people
have<00:00:09.030> thought<00:00:09.330> about<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.900> made<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
have thought about this and made a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.140 
have thought about this and made a
theory<00:00:10.469> video<00:00:10.740> on<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.460> second<00:00:11.820> one<00:00:11.940> I've

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
theory video on this the second one I've

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.020 
theory video on this the second one I've
never<00:00:12.690> really<00:00:13.019> seen<00:00:13.290> anyone<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:14.370> dealt<00:00:14.790> in

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
never really seen anyone really dealt in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
never really seen anyone really dealt in
too<00:00:15.240> much<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.750> since<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.830> kind<00:00:17.190> of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
too much with this since it kind of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.070 
too much with this since it kind of
makes<00:00:17.460> sense<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.090> doesn't<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.539> same<00:00:18.779> time

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
makes sense and it doesn't the same time

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590 
makes sense and it doesn't the same time
it<00:00:19.590> has<00:00:19.740> many<00:00:20.160> flows<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.939> theory<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.570> well

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
it has many flows this theory as well

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.939 
it has many flows this theory as well
since<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:25.080> third<00:00:25.470> game<00:00:25.710> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
since you know this the third game is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.950 
since you know this the third game is
set<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.430> far<00:00:26.609> into<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> future<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
set so far into the future with the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.929 
set so far into the future with the
first<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.800> second<00:00:29.099> game<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> second

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
first and second game like the second

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
first and second game like the second
games<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.199> know<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.560> can't<00:00:31.800> remember

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
games like it you know I can't remember

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.709 
games like it you know I can't remember
how<00:00:32.160> many<00:00:32.189> years<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.910> before<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.510> first

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
how many years it was before the first

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.200 
how many years it was before the first
game<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.350> I'm<00:00:35.010> actually<00:00:35.219> wondering<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
game so I'm actually wondering is it the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.720 
game so I'm actually wondering is it the
I<00:00:36.239> should<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.600> saying<00:00:36.899> phone<00:00:37.200> guy<00:00:37.440> since<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
I should be saying phone guy since you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
I should be saying phone guy since you
know<00:00:38.850> same<00:00:39.270> voice<00:00:39.510> actor<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> video<00:00:40.739> game

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
know same voice actor of the video game

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.549 
know same voice actor of the video game
creosote<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.090> know<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.629> sure<00:00:42.960> since<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.410> not

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
creosote I know you sure since I'm not

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
creosote I know you sure since I'm not
going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> comment<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.460> probably<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.789> be

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
going to comment it probably is be

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
going to comment it probably is be
honest<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.170> yang<00:00:46.590> li<00:00:46.800> dong<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.190> start<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
honest so yang li dong I start with a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.170 
honest so yang li dong I start with a
min<00:00:47.940> theory<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.480> fun<00:00:49.230> guy<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.530> still<00:00:49.950> alive<00:00:50.180> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
min theory is fun guy is still alive so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.840 
min theory is fun guy is still alive so
since<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:52.829> game<00:00:53.100> we

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
since you know in the very first game we

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
since you know in the very first game we
see<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.350> guys<00:00:55.500> alive<00:00:55.890> then

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
see that you know if one guys alive then

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
see that you know if one guys alive then
all<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.420> sudden<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.809> 93<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.739> hear<00:00:58.949> these

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
all of a sudden I'm 93 we can hear these

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.450 
all of a sudden I'm 93 we can hear these
noises<00:00:59.180> that<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:01.079> know<00:01:01.199> Freddy<00:01:01.469> comes<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
noises that you know Freddy comes in and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
noises that you know Freddy comes in and
maybe<00:01:02.699> people<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.539> may<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.840> died<00:01:04.110> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
maybe people think he may have died so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
maybe people think he may have died so
since<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> pre-recording<00:01:06.689> many<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
since this was a pre-recording many of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200 
since this was a pre-recording many of
us<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.439> seen<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.400> stopping<00:01:08.909> him<00:01:09.180> from

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
us have seen that or stopping him from

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.080 
us have seen that or stopping him from
just<00:01:09.659> making<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.140> those<00:01:10.380> noises<00:01:10.650> since<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.460> know

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just making up those noises since I know

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
just making up those noises since I know
I<00:01:12.330> don't<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.750> how<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.110> could<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.619> done<00:01:13.740> up

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
I don't know how we could have done up

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
I don't know how we could have done up
but<00:01:14.159> there's<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:15.030> once<00:01:15.270> again<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
but there's just this once again this is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960 
but there's just this once again this is
just<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> theory<00:01:16.439> discusses<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.490> theory

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just the theory discusses a theory

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880 
just the theory discusses a theory
doesn't<00:01:18.180> mean<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.570> has<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.990> true<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
doesn't mean it has to be true this is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
doesn't mean it has to be true this is
just<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.250> random<00:01:20.640> idea<00:01:20.790> which<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.960> came

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
just a random idea which I actually came

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
just a random idea which I actually came
to<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.619> head<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.580> wasn't<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.939> main

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
to my head but that wasn't the main

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
to my head but that wasn't the main
thing<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:26.100> could

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
thing which really you know which could

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
thing which really you know which could
be<00:01:26.700> interesting<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.750> path<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.350> where<00:01:28.560> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
be interesting the path to where this

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.190 
be interesting the path to where this
theory<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:30.140> interesting<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
theory is what I really interesting I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
theory is what I really interesting I
really<00:01:31.229> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> talk<00:01:31.860> about<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
really want to talk about so with you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
really want to talk about so with you
know<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.900> main<00:01:34.079> two<00:01:34.290> villains<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> series

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
know the main two villains in a series

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
know the main two villains in a series
there<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> purple<00:01:36.630> guy<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.829> people

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
there is the purple guy and some people

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.890 
there is the purple guy and some people
think<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.640> villains<00:01:38.970> phone<00:01:39.270> guy<00:01:39.509> since

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
think that have villains phone guy since

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
because and one of the cutscenes go see

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.869 
because and one of the cutscenes go see
is<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.469> people<00:02:16.739> guy<00:02:16.859> chasing<00:02:17.280> after<00:02:17.430> Freddie

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
can like shut him down so that's just a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.780 
can like shut him down so that's just a
random<00:02:22.500> theory<00:02:22.739> which<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.129> really<00:02:23.400> wanted<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
random theory which I really wanted to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.240 
random theory which I really wanted to
talk<00:02:24.000> about<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.540> know<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.590> many<00:02:25.920> floors

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
talk about I know it as many floors

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.209 
talk about I know it as many floors
because<00:02:26.519> if<00:02:27.329> own<00:02:27.810> guy<00:02:27.989> was<00:02:28.349> still<00:02:28.590> alive<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
because if own guy was still alive and

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.369 
because if own guy was still alive and
he<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.909> know<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.180> main<00:02:30.359> man<00:02:30.810> killer<00:02:31.109> you

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
he was you know the main man killer you

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.539 
he was you know the main man killer you
wouldn't<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.620> able<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.769> do<00:02:31.920> anything<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
wouldn't be able to do anything and

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.970 
wouldn't be able to do anything and
that's<00:02:33.030> he<00:02:33.299> had<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.959> son<00:02:34.290> or<00:02:34.319> something<00:02:34.769> to

that's he had like a son or something to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979 
that's he had like a son or something to
you<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.519> take<00:02:36.090> his<00:02:36.299> place<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.540> being<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
you know take his place as being a

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.170 
you know take his place as being a
villain<00:02:37.170> maybe<00:02:37.620> that's<00:02:38.280> his<00:02:38.459> son<00:02:38.700> inside<00:02:39.000> of

villain maybe that's his son inside of

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.390 
villain maybe that's his son inside of
the<00:02:39.239> zoo<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.689> don't<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:40.139> for<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.889> original

the zoo I don't see for the original

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910 
the zoo I don't see for the original
phone<00:02:41.579> guy<00:02:41.819> being<00:02:42.120> inside<00:02:42.689> you<00:02:43.049> know<00:02:43.469> this<00:02:43.680> new

phone guy being inside you know this new

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.460 
phone guy being inside you know this new
animatronic<00:02:44.639> because<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:46.079> know<00:02:46.169> he's<00:02:46.319> like

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
animatronic because you know he's like

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.530 
animatronic because you know he's like
really<00:02:46.680> all<00:02:46.919> the<00:02:47.250> county<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.760> anything<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.419> as

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
really all the county to anything and as

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.449 
really all the county to anything and as
he<00:02:48.659> had<00:02:48.810> some<00:02:49.439> sort<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.739> like<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:49.980> gun<00:02:50.310> or

something<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:50.939> so<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.659> pretty<00:02:52.200> much<00:02:52.260> it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
something like that so I pretty much it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.020 
something like that so I pretty much it
for<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.680> video<00:02:52.919> I<00:02:53.129> thought<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.489> pretty

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
for this video I thought is pretty

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.699 
for this video I thought is pretty
interesting<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.569> be<00:02:54.689> honest<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:54.989> kind<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
interesting to be honest I kind of

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.229 
interesting to be honest I kind of
explained<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.220> pretty<00:02:56.280> well<00:02:56.549> there<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.120> many

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
explained it pretty well there are many

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.599 
explained it pretty well there are many
floors<00:02:57.659> obviously<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:58.889> theory<00:02:59.129> every

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
floors obviously to this theory every

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.640 
floors obviously to this theory every
Theory<00:03:00.000> has<00:03:00.150> many<00:03:00.419> flaws<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:00.989> yeah<00:03:01.500> that's

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
Theory has many flaws so yeah that's

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.619 
Theory has many flaws so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:01.769> much<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.189> I'm<00:03:02.430> really<00:03:02.969> interested<00:03:03.239> is
