00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:02.980
 there we are also seeing 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.860
 caba sl the hat 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.310
 get up or not 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.310
 and the reasons among them the no 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.929
 your horse that we are is more sustains a time of a month of work with this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.000
 kind of exercise we see that you are not thinking of doing next 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.039
 Gerardo 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.730
 this difficult silence exercise is called caravan is how it should reopen its 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.569
 hands 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.300
 and lower your head 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.460
 you practically 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.630
 head on the floor 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.280
 He exercised unnatural 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.450
 it's hard 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.290
 but is not already doing 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.240
 Pedro with that horse 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.780
 in prÃ­ncipi humor he just has with him working 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.830
 In the space of three weeks, we also talk about the beautiful dick that really reads 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.810
 they manage to do this to the horses 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.810
 there goes again 7m 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.290
 efe as I repeat is a position as 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.510
 as 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.850
 excited for hoarding horse but nevertheless 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.230
 on the part of science they make it simply aesthetic the order a 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.790
 clear signal 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.570
 adding a little bit the paddles or the part of the men that would be 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 horse 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.580
 a caress that they make as a reward for having obeyed and for having achieved 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.280
 this position 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.430
 complicated for horses but they do it because they are very intelligent and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.990
 they like it too 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.159
 in the afternoon to the one that is training them in their partner batasuna consciousness 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.060
 Christian that has to be done in a binomial 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.460
 something has to be formed 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.340
 air sanctioning that make the bows specify is different is 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.750
 simpler than the caravan 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.160
 they are exercises and belts and everything if you are not seeing 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.130
 the foal the horse 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.430
 he works for a pariah mind prince is a horse 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.940
 very well educated who loves to participate and who loves to do things 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.850
 very interesting right now we're seeing gerard 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.870
 - it is a reverence 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.830
 driven 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.830
 the kid 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.460
 there's the side 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.229
 As you can see all the exercises are done 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.430
 by means of positive reinforcements 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.489
 and so a caress is already a prize 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.139
 that the prince loves cookies 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.549
 finally the sitting which is also a very unnatural drive 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.549
 It is not very easy to sit and sit down 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.719
 vicky up that in some exercises that perform 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.030
 how nice that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.889
 I read that it was really possible to see these wonderful animals 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.849
 how much love 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.230
 is the training with how much dedication and as if they achieve 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.799
 respond in a way that are highly intelligent animals stay 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.639
 definitely the horse 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.020
 or as tolosa animal meters you treat well 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.329
 from here they have a little technical basis for work 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.549
 you're going to have pretty good results there are seven that you already know if you have 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.379
 horse and wants to leave him in tension and have his education and training 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.059
 you can reach it here not 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:00.859
 of training ecuextre volts and if you want to come to take classes also 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.909
 they are offering courses so that we learn a little more about being around 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.349
 of these wonderful animals that will reward us 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.859
 Much joy Gerardo is really have been a wonderful day that has 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.150
 passed here a lot of the range and as always that we have is that 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.779

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.279
 at your orders for 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.410
 the doors open for anyone who wants to come and meet 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.610
