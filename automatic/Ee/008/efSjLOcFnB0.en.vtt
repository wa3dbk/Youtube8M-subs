00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
series on how to get more energy that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750 
series on how to get more energy that
magics<00:00:21.689> something<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.769> want<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.519> an

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
magics something that we all want is an

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.320 
magics something that we all want is an
endless<00:00:24.119> amounts<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.720> energy<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> today<00:00:26.789> we're

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
endless amounts of energy so today we're

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
endless amounts of energy so today we're
going<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> start<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> three<00:00:28.380> keys<00:00:29.010> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
going to start with the three keys that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
going to start with the three keys that
have<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.359> food<00:00:30.630> three<00:00:31.199> ways<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.710> eat

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
have to do with food three ways to eat

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.979 
have to do with food three ways to eat
for<00:00:33.030> energy<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.579> wait<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.480> energy

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
for energy so the first wait for energy

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.810 
for energy so the first wait for energy
is<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:38.010> eat<00:00:38.190> real<00:00:38.640> food<00:00:39.180> why<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.500> real

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
is to eat real food why are real

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.400 
is to eat real food why are real
unprocessed<00:00:41.820> foods<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.300> important<00:00:42.870> because

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
unprocessed foods so important because

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.790 
unprocessed foods so important because
they're<00:00:43.770> dynamic<00:00:44.600> nutrient-dense<00:00:45.800> foods

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
they're dynamic nutrient-dense foods

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.889 
they're dynamic nutrient-dense foods
that<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.399> body<00:00:47.579> knows<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that your body knows what to do with so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.310 
that your body knows what to do with so
when<00:00:49.260> your<00:00:49.379> body<00:00:49.559> tells<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.370> hungry

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
when your body tells you it's hungry

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
when your body tells you it's hungry
chances<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.800> looking<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.610> certain

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
chances are it's looking for certain

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.080 
chances are it's looking for certain
nutrients<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.590> we're<00:00:55.710> eating<00:00:56.070> real<00:00:56.340> foods<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
nutrients so we're eating real foods you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
nutrients so we're eating real foods you
get<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> nutrients<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.800> more

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
get more of the nutrients you get more

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.150 
get more of the nutrients you get more
of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> vitamins<00:00:59.550> minerals<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
of the vitamins minerals the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.139 
of the vitamins minerals the
antioxidants<00:01:02.160> all<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.520> those<00:01:02.670> really

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
antioxidants all of those really

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.270 
antioxidants all of those really
powerful<00:01:03.660> things<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.320> body<00:01:04.530> needs<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
powerful things that your body needs and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.620 
powerful things that your body needs and
helps<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> feel<00:01:06.890> energized<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.280> real<00:01:09.270> foods

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
helps you feel energized now real foods

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.289 
helps you feel energized now real foods
are<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.020> simulated<00:01:10.740> into<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> body<00:01:11.549> slower

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
are also simulated into the body slower

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.420 
are also simulated into the body slower
so<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.170> mean<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.590> means<00:01:13.799> less

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so what does that mean that means less

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.300 
so what does that mean that means less
blood<00:01:15.240> sugar<00:01:15.570> spikes<00:01:16.020> less<00:01:16.320> insulin<00:01:16.860> level

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
blood sugar spikes less insulin level

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.690 
blood sugar spikes less insulin level
spikes<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.509> no<00:01:19.170> crashing<00:01:19.799> afterwards<00:01:20.490> which

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
spikes so no crashing afterwards which

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.560 
spikes so no crashing afterwards which
is<00:01:20.880> key<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.439> having<00:01:22.439> long<00:01:23.000> sustainable<00:01:24.000> energy

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is key to having long sustainable energy

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
is key to having long sustainable energy
so<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.650> example<00:01:26.360> if<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:28.049> were<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> eat<00:01:28.670> white

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so for example if you were to eat white

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.109 
so for example if you were to eat white
flour<00:01:29.970> versus<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.280> whole-grain<00:01:32.280> stone-ground

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
flour versus a whole-grain stone-ground

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.010 
flour versus a whole-grain stone-ground
flour<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.740> process<00:01:35.460> flour<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:36.299> enter<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
flour the process flour will enter the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
flour the process flour will enter the
body<00:01:37.170> quicker<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.250> already<00:01:38.460> broken

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
body quicker because it's already broken

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.499 
body quicker because it's already broken
down<00:01:39.409> topsham<00:01:40.409> needs<00:01:40.619> spikes<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:41.729> I'm<00:01:42.150> sure

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
down topsham needs spikes which I'm sure

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
down topsham needs spikes which I'm sure
you've<00:01:42.659> heard<00:01:42.689> about<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.610> whole<00:01:44.610> unprocessed

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you've heard about so whole unprocessed

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.550 
you've heard about so whole unprocessed
food<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.340> all<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.610> its<00:01:47.790> forms<00:01:48.200> do<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> same

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
food in all of its forms do the same

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
food in all of its forms do the same
thing<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.100> body<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.880> that's<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.270> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
thing in your body so that's why it's so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.410 
thing in your body so that's why it's so
important<00:01:52.049> no<00:01:52.470> crashes<00:01:52.920> no<00:01:53.060> spikes<00:01:54.110> nine

important no crashes no spikes nine

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.550 
important no crashes no spikes nine
even<00:01:56.350> energy<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.700> we've<00:01:57.850> got<00:01:58.000> real<00:01:58.210> foods<00:01:58.570> step

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
even energy so we've got real foods step

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.550 
even energy so we've got real foods step
one<00:01:59.830> step<00:02:00.189> two<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:01.920> frequency<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:04.270> how<00:02:04.899> often

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
one step two is frequency now how often

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.669 
one step two is frequency now how often
do<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.100> eat<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.820> know<00:02:07.570> you've<00:02:07.990> probably<00:02:08.020> heard

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
do you eat I know you've probably heard

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.770 
do you eat I know you've probably heard
this<00:02:08.890> before<00:02:09.069> but<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.610> magic<00:02:10.000> number<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.330> 5

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
this before but the magic number is 5

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.080 
this before but the magic number is 5
times<00:02:11.080> 5<00:02:11.590> times<00:02:11.709> 6<00:02:12.100> times<00:02:12.220> if<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.819> handle

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
times 5 times 6 times if you can handle

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030 
times 5 times 6 times if you can handle
it<00:02:13.209> most<00:02:13.480> people<00:02:13.569> cat<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.170> 5<00:02:14.410> times<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.920> this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it most people cat so 5 times is this

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.880 
it most people cat so 5 times is this
super<00:02:15.700> great<00:02:15.940> place<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.390> start<00:02:16.600> why<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.620> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
super great place to start why is that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.910 
super great place to start why is that
important<00:02:18.850> well<00:02:19.390> again<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:20.170> don't<00:02:20.350> want<00:02:20.709> these

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
important well again we don't want these

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.180 
important well again we don't want these
spikes<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.880> crashes<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.019> occur<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:24.010> don't
