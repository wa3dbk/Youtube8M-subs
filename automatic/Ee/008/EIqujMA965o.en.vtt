over two years so today I'm going to
start<00:00:20.150> with<00:00:20.360> my<00:00:20.900> science<00:00:21.620> fiction<00:00:22.520> fantasy

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
start with my science fiction fantasy

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.380 
start with my science fiction fantasy
section<00:00:23.930> and<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:25.520> organization<00:00:26.210> of<00:00:26.240> these

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
section and the organization of these

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.730 
section and the organization of these
could<00:00:26.630> be<00:00:26.780> a<00:00:26.810> little<00:00:27.200> bit<00:00:27.320> better<00:00:27.500> than<00:00:27.680> the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
could be a little bit better than the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.840 
could be a little bit better than the
way<00:00:27.950> I<00:00:27.980> have<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.400> but<00:00:29.650> well<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.250> organization

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
way I have it but well the organization

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.399 
way I have it but well the organization
system<00:00:32.210> still<00:00:32.449> make<00:00:32.599> some<00:00:32.870> sense<00:00:33.050> I've<00:00:33.289> been

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:33.409 
system still make some sense I've been

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:34.869 
system still make some sense I've been
doing<00:00:33.589> some<00:00:33.620> purging<00:00:34.159> and<00:00:34.219> rearranging<00:00:34.789> and

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
doing some purging and rearranging and

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.130 
doing some purging and rearranging and
everything<00:00:35.210> else<00:00:35.359> but<00:00:35.539> everything<00:00:35.929> is

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
everything else but everything is

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.290 
everything else but everything is
generally<00:00:36.679> where<00:00:36.829> it's<00:00:36.920> supposed<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.249> be<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.239> I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
generally where it's supposed to be so I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.399 
generally where it's supposed to be so I
guess<00:00:38.480> we'll<00:00:38.600> start<00:00:38.719> down<00:00:39.079> here<00:00:39.140> at<00:00:39.350> the

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
guess we'll start down here at the

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:40.750 
guess we'll start down here at the
bottom<00:00:39.469> in<00:00:39.800> case<00:00:39.949> you<00:00:40.069> notice<00:00:40.280> yeah<00:00:40.429> my<00:00:40.579> blu

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
bottom in case you notice yeah my blu

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.630 
bottom in case you notice yeah my blu
rays<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.149> dvds<00:00:41.239> are<00:00:41.949> mixed<00:00:42.949> together<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.280> used

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
rays and dvds are mixed together I used

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.979 
rays and dvds are mixed together I used
to<00:00:43.699> keep<00:00:43.850> them<00:00:44.030> separate<00:00:44.329> once<00:00:44.510> upon<00:00:44.719> a<00:00:44.749> time

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
to keep them separate once upon a time

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.599 
to keep them separate once upon a time
but<00:00:45.019> I<00:00:45.199> actually<00:00:45.409> kind<00:00:46.069> of<00:00:46.100> prefer<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:46.489> this

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
but I actually kind of prefer it this

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:47.979 
but I actually kind of prefer it this
way<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:46.879> i<00:00:47.059> can<00:00:47.239> keep<00:00:47.359> everything<00:00:47.659> in<00:00:47.899> that

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
way so i can keep everything in that

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.569 
way so i can keep everything in that
same<00:00:48.319> genre<00:00:48.589> because<00:00:48.859> there<00:00:49.190> are<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.339> lot<00:00:49.550> of

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
same genre because there are a lot of

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.029 
same genre because there are a lot of
movies<00:00:49.969> that<00:00:50.179> i<00:00:50.719> don't<00:00:50.929> really<00:00:51.109> intend<00:00:51.769> on

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
movies that i don't really intend on

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
movies that i don't really intend on
purchasing<00:00:52.550> again<00:00:52.850> on<00:00:53.120> blu-ray<00:00:54.789> mainly<00:00:55.789> cause

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
purchasing again on blu-ray mainly cause

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.849 
purchasing again on blu-ray mainly cause
factors<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:56.929> and<00:00:57.079> i<00:00:57.139> just<00:00:57.379> don't<00:00:57.649> watch

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
factors and that and i just don't watch

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.029 
factors and that and i just don't watch
them<00:00:58.039> enough<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.399> justify<00:00:58.699> buying<00:00:59.059> them<00:00:59.329> twice

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
them enough to justify buying them twice

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.619 
them enough to justify buying them twice
we'll<00:01:01.039> start<00:01:01.339> right<00:01:01.399> here<00:01:01.519> at<00:01:01.729> the<00:01:01.819> end<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.210> we

movie but never really took off and the
theater<00:04:48.840> was<00:04:49.470> more<00:04:49.740> or<00:04:49.800> less<00:04:49.830> just

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
same time and of course I want to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.700 
same time and of course I want to
believe<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.010> 2008<00:04:56.940> movie<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.620> think<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
believe the 2008 movie I think the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.340 
believe the 2008 movie I think the
strongest<00:04:59.070> points<00:04:59.370> in<00:04:59.490> this<00:04:59.690> movie<00:05:00.690> is<00:05:00.840> kind

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
strongest points in this movie is kind

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.320 
strongest points in this movie is kind
of<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.500> background<00:05:02.190> or<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.700> get<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:03.000> catch<00:05:03.150> up

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
of the background or you get to catch up

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.240 
of the background or you get to catch up
on<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.540> characters<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:03.990> story<00:05:04.350> itself<00:05:04.770> but<00:05:05.190> I

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
on the characters a story itself but I

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.590 
on the characters a story itself but I
think<00:05:05.730> they<00:05:05.850> could<00:05:06.000> have<00:05:06.030> done<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> little<00:05:06.420> bit

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
think they could have done a little bit

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.120 
think they could have done a little bit
better<00:05:07.970> Iron<00:05:08.970> Man<00:05:09.500> like<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.650> first<00:05:10.890> one

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
better Iron Man like the first one

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.000 
better Iron Man like the first one
second<00:05:11.520> one<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:12.080> saw<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.200> in<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.320> theater<00:05:13.740> and

second one I saw it in the theater and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.180 
second one I saw it in the theater and
it<00:05:14.310> was<00:05:14.660> ok<00:05:15.660> but<00:05:16.020> didn't<00:05:16.440> really<00:05:16.710> live<00:05:16.950> up<00:05:16.980> to

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.430 
it was ok but didn't really live up to
the<00:05:17.280> first<00:05:17.430> one<00:05:17.760> then<00:05:18.390> of<00:05:18.510> course<00:05:18.780> this<00:05:19.230> is<00:05:19.410> a

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
series near the end when I look at it

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.300 
series near the end when I look at it
now<00:06:45.180> was<00:06:45.510> just<00:06:45.900> a<00:06:46.140> little<00:06:46.440> too<00:06:46.560> commercialized

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
now was just a little too commercialized

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.510 
now was just a little too commercialized
for<00:06:47.640> me<00:06:47.790> but<00:06:48.060> it's<00:06:48.770> like<00:06:49.770> I<00:06:50.070> could<00:06:50.250> say<00:06:50.370> that's

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
for me but it's like I could say that's

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.100 
for me but it's like I could say that's
something<00:06:51.150> I<00:06:51.210> could<00:06:51.390> be<00:06:51.450> said<00:06:51.600> with<00:06:51.750> a<00:06:51.780> lot<00:06:51.990> of

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
something I could be said with a lot of

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.450 
something I could be said with a lot of
these<00:06:52.170> movies<00:06:52.560> so<00:06:52.710> you<00:06:52.800> really<00:06:53.040> just<00:06:53.190> have<00:06:53.340> to

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
these movies so you really just have to

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.680 
these movies so you really just have to
look<00:06:53.610> at<00:06:53.730> them<00:06:53.850> as<00:06:54.000> entertainment<00:06:54.510> or

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
look at them as entertainment or

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.540 
look at them as entertainment or
something<00:06:55.440> like<00:06:55.530> that<00:06:55.590> I<00:06:55.950> think<00:06:56.310> the<00:06:56.400> big

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
something like that I think the big

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.490 
something like that I think the big
problem<00:06:56.730> right<00:06:57.150> now<00:06:57.750> is<00:06:57.930> we're<00:06:58.200> not<00:06:58.320> really

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
problem right now is we're not really

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.290 
problem right now is we're not really
seeing<00:06:58.800> anything<00:06:59.100> new<00:06:59.640> because<00:06:59.850> a<00:07:00.030> lot<00:07:00.270> of
