I<00:02:41.720> think<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.380> timeless<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.010> mean<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.310> know<00:02:43.459> it's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
I think it's timeless I mean I know it's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.460 
I think it's timeless I mean I know it's
an<00:02:43.790> old<00:02:43.880> building<00:02:44.090> but<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.660> looks<00:02:44.989> like<00:02:45.260> it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
an old building but it looks like it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.410 
an old building but it looks like it
could<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.650> been<00:02:45.829> built<00:02:46.100> yesterday<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.150> this

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
could have been built yesterday and this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.360 
could have been built yesterday and this
looks<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:47.930> fresh<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.440> really<00:02:48.709> does<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
looks so fresh it really does and the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.430 
looks so fresh it really does and the
whole<00:02:49.760> purpose<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.450> these<00:02:50.600> buildings<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.320> way

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
whole purpose of these buildings the way

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.960 
whole purpose of these buildings the way
they<00:02:51.590> were<00:02:51.650> designed<00:02:51.860> as<00:02:52.340> they<00:02:52.519> told<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.940> story

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
they were designed as they told a story

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.050 
they were designed as they told a story
so<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.900> seems<00:02:54.170> like<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.610> designers<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.640> this

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
so it seems like the designers of this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.110 
so it seems like the designers of this
era<00:02:56.739> because<00:02:57.739> they<00:02:57.860> did<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.130> with<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.549> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
era because they did this with the the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.180 
era because they did this with the the
courthouse<00:02:59.480> there<00:03:00.019> were<00:03:00.110> items<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:01.010> are

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
courthouse there were items that are

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.490 
courthouse there were items that are
incorporated<00:03:02.120> into<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.329> design<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:03.140> meant

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
incorporated into the design that meant

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.440 
incorporated into the design that meant
something<00:03:03.799> next<00:03:04.730> we<00:03:04.820> took<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.000> trip<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.269> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
something next we took a trip to the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.780 
something next we took a trip to the

building<00:04:15.720> reads<00:04:15.990> is<00:04:16.410> you've<00:04:16.950> got<00:04:17.160> three

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
building reads is you've got three

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.370 
building reads is you've got three
sections<00:04:17.970> vertically<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.020> building

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
sections vertically of the building

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.700 
sections vertically of the building
which<00:04:19.590> actually<00:04:20.280> create<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:21.030> column<00:04:21.660> oK<00:04:22.530> you've

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
which actually create a column oK you've

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.550 
which actually create a column oK you've
got<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.310> base<00:04:23.520> which<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.240> comprised<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.230> these

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
got the base which is comprised of these

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.900 
got the base which is comprised of these
lentils<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.340> on<00:04:26.940> those<00:04:27.150> lentils<00:04:27.510> are

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
lentils and on those lentils are

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.320 
lentils and on those lentils are
sunburst<00:04:29.910> motif<00:04:30.720> with<00:04:31.530> serpents<00:04:32.340> okay<00:04:33.030> so

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
sunburst motif with serpents okay so

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.990 
sunburst motif with serpents okay so
that's<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.720> objection<00:04:34.230> that's<00:04:35.000> component

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
that's the objection that's component

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.730 
that's the objection that's component
and<00:04:36.120> then<00:04:36.270> you've<00:04:36.450> got<00:04:36.630> three<00:04:36.960> fenestration

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
and then you've got three fenestration

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.130 
and then you've got three fenestration
areas<00:04:38.610> here<00:04:38.880> in<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.060> front<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.810> sort<00:04:40.080> of

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
areas here in the front that sort of

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.250 
areas here in the front that sort of
lift<00:04:40.500> up<00:04:40.880> like<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.940> column<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.630> then<00:04:43.050> at<00:04:43.170> the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
lift up like a column and then at the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.530 
lift up like a column and then at the
top<00:04:43.440> you've<00:04:43.740> got<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.040> heavy<00:04:44.340> cornice<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.390> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
top you've got this heavy cornice so the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.420 
top you've got this heavy cornice so the
building<00:04:45.900> was<00:04:46.050> built<00:04:46.560> as<00:04:46.830> sort<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.160> this

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
building was built as sort of this

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.870 
building was built as sort of this
column<00:04:48.420> piece<00:04:49.040> this<00:04:50.040> was<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.610> first

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
column piece this was one of the first

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.180 
column piece this was one of the first
major<00:04:51.300> projects<00:04:52.110> then<00:04:52.320> as<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.770> part<00:04:53.070> of<00:04:53.100> the

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
major projects then as a part of the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.800 
major projects then as a part of the
mainstream<00:04:53.400> program<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.150> she'll<00:04:54.360> be<00:04:54.540> back<00:04:54.570> so

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
mainstream program and she'll be back so

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.320 
mainstream program and she'll be back so
this<00:04:54.960> was<00:04:55.140> about<00:04:55.290> three<00:04:55.710> 8485<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:56.790> yet<00:04:56.970> another

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
this was about three 8485 so yet another

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.000 
this was about three 8485 so yet another
example<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:58.110> these<00:04:58.260> buildings<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.890> were

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
built right they were built to last and

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.040 
built right they were built to last and
now<00:05:01.830> they<00:05:02.010> have<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.190> new<00:05:02.250> life<00:05:02.660> after<00:05:03.660> learning
