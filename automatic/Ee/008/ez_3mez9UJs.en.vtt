 These woods Renner is one of the largest ski resorts in the Alps 230 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.339
 Piste kilometers Wait for dozens and leave over 50 sites 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.689
 Winter sports beat hearts 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.660
 so that the slopes are in perfect shape day after day they are not 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.719
 Dozens of piste equipment are on their way in the Silvretta Arena 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.359
 building the children behind Rock Festival 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.389
 Since Mitte started that the German rocker crash hardly hard loud communication was 

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:47.619
 the last set in this regard sit down every night 

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:49.729
 to 30 to 9 the movement 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.370
 every single one has a horsepower of 400 hp, proud of Ellen 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.370
 and costs about 400,000 euros 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.520
 one of the main tasks of the drivers is the preparation of the slopes 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.590
 the milling and smoothing of the top snow layers 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.230
 Since this is hardly possible during the operating hours Dechant for the drivers of 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.230
 Working day is clear before sunset 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030
 one of them is Jürgen strong 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 Together with his colleagues, the daily Silvretta Arena is on the road 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 to put the slopes back in order 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.750
 It's a tough job and, above all, a cold job 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.960
 Waving from the drivers' fingertip and teamwork 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.330
 but without their use would be a usual perfect slope conditions in 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
 not to think of the Silvretta Arena 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.240
 Hal busy there 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.670
 that he 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.850
 but since also possible for SARS or Saab then the sixth and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.420
 last round no matter what is there most important Gaal who she is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 Disability is not going to be there to help me 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.580
 I'm sick of it 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.670
 Dr purchase price had waived because 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.999
 at the same time are also Andreas Schmidt and a few kilometers away 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.979
 Johannes Igel in the ski area on the go who are the fast specialists 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.230
 responsible for the control and positioning 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.510
 who over 950 snow cannons in the Silvretta Arena 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.439
 The most important requirement is good planning and preparation 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.799
 we call today on the field Walldorf 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.009
 Arab supervisor under pressure shifted to Voeckler 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.789
 as it is discussed it was the course put 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.869
 Roßkopf optical out 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.859
 Waiver points lay in front 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.269
 our job is because you could take a cruiser school for open 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.599
 voss-tecklenburg Dr 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.599
 on the form 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.269
 in some places, the slopes are so steep that even the steel door 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.989
 needed devices do not find enough stop 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.359
 if the safety is no longer given you can use special vehicles 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.169
 Winches for use in which the tons of heavy vehicle rather a 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.069
 Steel rope can be secured 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.679
 All the more dangerous is the drive through the pitch-dark night when the weather 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.199
 does not play music through snow wind and fog 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.809
 additionally worsened 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.389
 I wait for the first time whether it's angular Rock Rock Rock IT or not 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.089
 currently 11 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:49.789
 it also shows that he's leaving the quartet but missed his fast 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:50.509
 but 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.309
 it's about two percent 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:54.899
 she is 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:56.849
 open the race 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.849
 So David Arquette is confused and back again is absurd 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.539
 and then they are in the second part 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.589
 At over 20 degrees below freezing, the tenants continue to advise advises 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.599
 Therefore, at the AG Schneekanonen owner, they are demanding themselves and the 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.079
 Machines everything off
