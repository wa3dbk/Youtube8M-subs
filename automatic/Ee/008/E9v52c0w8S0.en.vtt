kind of alternative I don't even know
how<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.479> would<00:01:52.930> describe<00:01:53.110> it

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.790 

I<00:01:55.929> heard<00:01:56.649> you<00:01:57.039> just<00:01:57.429> say

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.710 

i<00:02:04.590> would<00:02:05.590> say<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.740> rich<00:02:06.040> has<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> raw

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
i would say that rich has a raw

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.170 
i would say that rich has a raw
vulnerability<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.930> his<00:02:08.170> voice<00:02:08.380> well<00:02:09.369> um<00:02:09.580> that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
vulnerability to his voice well um that

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.040 
vulnerability to his voice well um that
helps<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.869> connect<00:02:11.230> into<00:02:12.240> how<00:02:13.240> what<00:02:13.840> he's

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
helps you connect into how what he's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:36.720 
helps you connect into how what he's
feeling<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.220> song<00:02:15.400> he's<00:02:15.580> singing

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.970 

Iole<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:38.000> one<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.780> my<00:02:38.870> favorite<00:02:39.200> projects<00:02:39.620> that

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
Iole is one of my favorite projects that

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.690 
Iole is one of my favorite projects that
I've<00:02:40.100> worked<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.490> you<00:02:41.420> can<00:02:41.600> take<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.290> know

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
I've worked on you can take you know

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.370 
I've worked on you can take you know
simple<00:02:43.700> three<00:02:43.970> chord<00:02:44.210> songs<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.960> they<00:02:45.110> sound

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
simple three chord songs and they sound

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.100 
simple three chord songs and they sound
so<00:02:45.650> different<00:02:45.830> because<00:02:46.540> they<00:02:47.540> all<00:02:47.780> have<00:02:48.080> a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
so different because they all have a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.680 
so different because they all have a
different<00:02:48.350> heart<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:48.980> then<00:02:49.550> adding<00:02:49.970> adding

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
different heart and then adding adding

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.030 
different heart and then adding adding
more<00:02:51.140> instrumentation<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.670> each<00:02:52.940> song

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
more instrumentation to each song

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.500 
more instrumentation to each song
because<00:02:55.040> each<00:02:55.340> song<00:02:55.580> has<00:02:55.610> its<00:02:55.940> own<00:02:56.060> heart<00:02:56.330> it

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
because each song has its own heart it

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.130 
because each song has its own heart it
becomes<00:02:56.990> its<00:02:57.410> own<00:02:57.620> thing<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:59.120> so<00:02:59.990> much

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
becomes its own thing you see so much

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.990 
becomes its own thing you see so much
different<00:03:00.560> scenery<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.370> instrumentation

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
different scenery in the instrumentation

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.930 
different scenery in the instrumentation
from<00:03:02.450> some<00:03:02.690> song<00:03:03.020> song<00:03:03.459> if<00:03:04.459> somebody<00:03:04.820> would

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
from some song song if somebody would

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.210 
from some song song if somebody would
