here<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:14.669> another<00:00:15.680> review<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:17.280> a<00:00:17.330> polybag

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
here with another review on a polybag

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.000 
here with another review on a polybag
set<00:00:18.780> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.920> set<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.910> features<00:00:21.450> a

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
set this is a set that features a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.200 
set this is a set that features a
smaller<00:00:23.010> beast<00:00:23.900> along<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.200> a<00:00:25.500> jumper<00:00:26.250> now<00:00:27.030> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
smaller beast along with a jumper now of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.780 
smaller beast along with a jumper now of
course<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.780> did<00:00:28.350> not<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.190> the<00:00:29.430> sex

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
course I did not actually get the sex

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.779 
course I did not actually get the sex
this<00:00:30.180> is<00:00:30.390> built<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.500> using<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> parts<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
this is built just using the parts and

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.049 
this is built just using the parts and
then<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.269> already<00:00:33.539> had<00:00:33.870> because<00:00:34.579> this<00:00:35.579> set<00:00:35.879> does

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
then I already had because this set does

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.779 
then I already had because this set does
not<00:00:36.239> feature<00:00:36.539> any<00:00:36.859> recolored<00:00:37.859> part<00:00:38.159> so<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.640> you

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
not feature any recolored part so if you

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.149 
not feature any recolored part so if you
get<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.210> set<00:00:39.539> and<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:40.289> expecting<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.980> get

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
get this set and we're expecting to get

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.790 
get this set and we're expecting to get
a<00:00:41.219> part<00:00:41.519> that<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.789> didn't<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.179> before<00:00:42.800> well

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
a part that you didn't have before well

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.180 
a part that you didn't have before well
then<00:00:44.640> you'd<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.480> disappointed<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.289> they

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
then you'd be disappointed because they

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
then you'd be disappointed because they
will<00:00:47.339> all<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:48.089> parts<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.749> you've<00:00:48.929> had

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
will all be parts that you've had

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.610 
will all be parts that you've had
already<00:00:49.519> but<00:00:50.519> if<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.329> looking<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.929> a<00:00:52.289> way

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
already but if you are looking for a way

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.009 
already but if you are looking for a way
to<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:52.949> more<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:53.460> trans<00:00:54.239> blue

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
to get more of these trans blue

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.410 
to get more of these trans blue
skeletal<00:00:57.019> pieces<00:00:57.500> then<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:58.760> would<00:00:59.059> probably

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
skeletal pieces then this would probably

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.389 
skeletal pieces then this would probably
be<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.079> set<00:01:00.289> for<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:02.949> this<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.009> basically

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
be the set for you so this is basically

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.770 
be the set for you so this is basically
supposed<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:05.210> be<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.330> smaller<00:01:05.869> version<00:01:06.619> of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
supposed to be a smaller version of

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.649 
supposed to be a smaller version of
crystal<00:01:08.780> beasts<00:01:12.970> well<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.270> does<00:01:14.630> look

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
crystal beasts well it does look

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.240 
crystal beasts well it does look
actually<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.619> bit<00:01:16.039> actually<00:01:16.789> smaller<00:01:17.420> than<00:01:17.539> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
actually a bit actually smaller than the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.190 
actually a bit actually smaller than the
amox<00:01:19.250> I've<00:01:19.549> done<00:01:19.789> of<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.560> jumpers<00:01:21.759> in<00:01:23.200> large

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
amox I've done of the jumpers in large

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.960 
amox I've done of the jumpers in large
action<00:01:24.649> figure<00:01:24.950> size<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.130> uses<00:01:28.340> an<00:01:28.640> X<00:01:28.789> key

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
action figure size and it uses an X key

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.309 
action figure size and it uses an X key
for<00:01:29.210> body<00:01:29.569> piece<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:31.780> there's<00:01:32.780> also<00:01:33.020> this

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
for body piece and there's also this

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.290 
for body piece and there's also this
piece<00:01:33.649> which<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:33.920> supposed<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.490> be<00:01:34.580> used<00:01:34.880> as<00:01:35.119> a

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
piece which is supposed to be used as a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.309 
piece which is supposed to be used as a
stand<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.500> some<00:01:36.710> sort<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.569> really<00:01:38.929> is<00:01:39.110> not

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
stand of some sort but it really is not

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.830 
stand of some sort but it really is not
all<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:39.590> necessary<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.090> I'm<00:01:41.210> actually<00:01:41.420> just

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
all that necessary so I'm actually just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.580 
all that necessary so I'm actually just
gonna<00:01:42.020> take<00:01:42.649> these<00:01:43.159> off<00:01:43.750> completely<00:01:44.750> and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
gonna take these off completely and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.279 
gonna take these off completely and
that's<00:01:46.580> more<00:01:47.539> like<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:49.360> now<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.630> really<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.140> not

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
that's more like it now I really do not

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.949 
that's more like it now I really do not
know<00:01:51.590> where<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.429> actually<00:01:52.580> get<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.630> set

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
know where you can actually get this set

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.399 
know where you can actually get this set
I<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.500> heard<00:01:54.830> online<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.759> it's<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.569> giveaway

world<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:11.300> does<00:02:11.569> seem<00:02:11.870> like<00:02:11.930> Lego<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.739> doing

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
world it does seem like Lego is doing

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.809 
world it does seem like Lego is doing
this<00:02:13.280> thing<00:02:14.120> with<00:02:14.450> releasing<00:02:15.080> poly<00:02:15.620> bags<00:02:16.010> with

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
this thing with releasing poly bags with

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.570 
this thing with releasing poly bags with
already<00:02:17.360> existing<00:02:17.510> pieces<00:02:18.319> just<00:02:19.160> as<00:02:19.340> they<00:02:19.519> did

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
already existing pieces just as they did

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.650 
already existing pieces just as they did
with<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.470> bionicle<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:22.370> course<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.940> never<00:02:23.420> got

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
with the bionicle of course I never got

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.030 
with the bionicle of course I never got
any<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.319> poly<00:02:24.560> bag<00:02:24.860> bionicle<00:02:26.500> sets<00:02:27.500> cuz

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
any of the poly bag bionicle sets cuz

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.020 
any of the poly bag bionicle sets cuz
there<00:02:28.580> was<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:29.269> nowhere<00:02:29.860> where<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.890> could<00:02:31.340> get

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
there was just nowhere where I could get

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.690 
there was just nowhere where I could get
them<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.140> seems<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.560> Lego<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.340> doing

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
them so it seems that Lego is just doing

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.040 
them so it seems that Lego is just doing
the<00:02:34.819> same<00:02:35.000> thing<00:02:35.300> with<00:02:35.510> hero<00:02:35.750> factory

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the same thing with hero factory

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.780 
the same thing with hero factory
releasing<00:02:37.780> poly<00:02:38.780> bags

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
