 you need some butter or some 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.590
 margarine marshmallows puffed rice 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.789
 also known as rice krispies 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 white chocolate chips 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.369
 sugar toppings for biscuits a 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.300
 rectangular mold and a cookie cutter 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.949
 heart-shaped take the mold 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 rectangular place a leaf 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.759
 of aluminum in the bottom of the mold and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.200
 grease the mold with oil and a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.280
 brush started melting the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280
 butter in a large saucepan 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.430
 then pour the four cups of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 marshmallow and heat over medium heat 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.649
 for guillemots to found but not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.660
 not burn to mix regularly when 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.309
 has melted add the nuggets of 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.719
 white chocolate and continue to mix 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.789
 when marshmallows and chocolate form 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.140
 of a homogeneous mixture add the five 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.400
 cups of puffed rice and mix for 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
 the mixture in the rectangular mold 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 that you have prepared earlier and at 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 bake the well turn the mold over 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.430
 a clean surface and remove the paper 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.630
 aluminum 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 it's better to work as long as the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.229
 blown rice plate is still hot 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 because it helps to stick the toppings 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.409
 take the heart shaped cookie cutter 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.310
 and rice chops and choirs 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.960
 blown rice bodies and hearts 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.840
 blown with trimmings of saint 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.340
 valentine 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.299
 when you can see it's not 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.549
 the choice that is missing 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.409
 and again I limited myself to tones 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.630
 red pink white decorate the edges 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.829
 cookies or the center or both 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.180
 it's a beautiful activity where every 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.119
 child can let go of his creativity 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.659

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.659

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.270
