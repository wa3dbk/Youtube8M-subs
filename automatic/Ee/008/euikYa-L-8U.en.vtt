00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.030 
this is going to be the video of what my
setup<00:00:07.470> looks<00:00:07.740> like<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.400> hatchery<00:00:08.970> or<00:00:10.040> at

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
setup looks like in the hatchery or at

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.860 
setup looks like in the hatchery or at
least<00:00:11.340> where<00:00:11.759> I'm<00:00:11.940> gonna<00:00:12.179> put<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.630> hatched

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
least where I'm gonna put the hatched

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.640 
least where I'm gonna put the hatched
eggs<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.099> clownfish

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
eggs of the clownfish

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.380 
eggs of the clownfish
it's<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.859> basically<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.430> 10<00:00:17.970> gallon<00:00:18.470> old

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
it's just basically a 10 gallon old

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.910 
it's just basically a 10 gallon old
aquarium<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.480> used<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.779> use<00:00:21.930> as<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> sump<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.769> my

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
aquarium I used to use as a sump in my

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.960 
aquarium I used to use as a sump in my
old<00:00:23.130> 55<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:25.050> I've<00:00:25.230> cleaned<00:00:25.590> out<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> have

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
old 55 that I've cleaned out and I have

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.930 
old 55 that I've cleaned out and I have
a<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.240> piece<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.680> live<00:00:28.680> rock<00:00:29.039> there<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
a little piece of live rock there and

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.520 
a little piece of live rock there and
just<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> air<00:00:33.510> stone<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> bit<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
just out of the air stone with a bit of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.340 
just out of the air stone with a bit of
bubbles<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.219> keep<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> movement<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:36.350> I'm

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
bubbles to keep the movement going I'm

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.660 
bubbles to keep the movement going I'm
probably<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> increase<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.460> air

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
probably going to increase the air

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
probably going to increase the air
pressure<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> once<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> hatchlings

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
pressure on it once I put the hatchlings

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.750 
pressure on it once I put the hatchlings
in<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:45.110> that's<00:00:46.110> basically<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.219> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.370 

it's<00:00:51.240> all<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> garage<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:52.380> workbench<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's all in the garage on my workbench I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.440 
it's all in the garage on my workbench I
guess<00:00:55.380> I<00:00:55.530> dedicated<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.790> my<00:00:57.000> workbench

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
guess I dedicated some of my workbench

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.250 
guess I dedicated some of my workbench
space<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.290> them<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.300> over<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.630> I<00:01:00.930> have

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
space for them and then over here I have

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.460 
space for them and then over here I have
some<00:01:02.900> brine<00:01:03.900> shrimp<00:01:04.040> eggs<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.520> I'm<00:01:05.670> hatching

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
some brine shrimp eggs that I'm hatching

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.510 
some brine shrimp eggs that I'm hatching
I'm<00:01:07.470> getting<00:01:07.950> them<00:01:08.130> ready<00:01:08.370> for<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:09.390> clownfish

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
I'm getting them ready for the clownfish

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.840 
I'm getting them ready for the clownfish
hatchlings<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> hatch<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.850> I've

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
hatchlings to hatch and then I've

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.150 
hatchlings to hatch and then I've
probably<00:01:15.150> feed<00:01:15.510> than<00:01:15.690> that<00:01:15.870> I<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.830> should

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
probably feed than that I know I should

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.010 
probably feed than that I know I should
have<00:01:17.190> gone<00:01:17.430> rata<00:01:17.880> furs<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.510> couldn't<00:01:18.900> get

online<00:01:26.910> in<00:01:27.360> time<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> eggs<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.619> hatch<00:01:29.240> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
online in time for the eggs to hatch so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.890 
online in time for the eggs to hatch so
unfortunately<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:32.150> most<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.300> my<00:01:33.360> hatch

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
unfortunately I know most of my hatch

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
unfortunately I know most of my hatch
eggs<00:01:34.350> might<00:01:34.770> die<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:38.390> which

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
eggs might die if not all of them which

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.609 
eggs might die if not all of them which
is<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.080> be<00:01:40.290> bad<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.090> it's<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.290> first<00:01:43.290> good

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
is going to be bad but it's a first good

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
is going to be bad but it's a first good
first<00:01:43.860> experience<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.580> me<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.180> then

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
first experience for me and then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
first experience for me and then
