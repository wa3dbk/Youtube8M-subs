 once they have it downloaded then 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.540
 there will be a rar file like this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 If it does not appear to you, well, you should 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.290
 have the winrar program installed 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.989
 I also leave it at the bottom 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 if you do not have it once 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.559
 to click right on it and we're going 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.270

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.930
 to extract everything because good is going to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.250
 something like this is an iso file that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.460
 we will use to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.560
 if it does not appear this way when 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.750
 you must have installed a program that 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.090
 it generates a virtual unit to mount 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.040
 images did I leave you in the part of 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.020
 down ultraism and damon tools for 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.850
 that good also you have us and of this 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.610
 way you can have the complete tutorial 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.470
 let's give it right click on it a 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.020
 Once you have it, we will give it in 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.330

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.130

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.770
 main thing that is what we have here 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.540

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.800
 folder to see the files since 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.590
 Well, this is what we are going to use 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.000
 after this part I recommend 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 that temporarily deactivate 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.930
 antivirus that we have we are going to click on 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.880
 right in the sector once we 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.119
 open this screen so good and we're going to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.190
 uncheck the box that is this and good 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.649
 nothing down here and ready or not just 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.509
 let's give it where it says install and 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.280
 let's wait for him to install all the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.899
 I play correctly I come back with 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.759

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.070
 that was installed correctly 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.739
 simply because we do not have to give 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.910
 on the end button now that follows 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.980
 we are going to come back 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.670
 beta where I told them there was the unit 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.620
 in the iso mounted in this case is this and 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.410
 Well, let's open the folder that 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.720
 says codex in data and well let's 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.480

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.120

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.510
 program and well in this case 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.860

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.440

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.990
