Medcenter<00:02:07.130> fence<00:02:07.669> made<00:02:07.939> about<00:02:08.239> a<00:02:08.300> few<00:02:08.509> of

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
Medcenter fence made about a few of

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.230 
Medcenter fence made about a few of
those<00:02:08.719> and

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
those and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.030 
those and
they<00:02:09.630> only<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.870> a<00:02:09.930> go<00:02:10.050> flag<00:02:10.260> 200<00:02:10.740> anyway<00:02:10.980> so

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
they only have a go flag 200 anyway so

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.330 
they only have a go flag 200 anyway so
what's<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> point<00:02:12.830> many<00:02:13.830> spend<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.160> fee<00:02:14.310> for

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
what's the point many spend a fee for

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.830 
what's the point many spend a fee for
points<00:02:14.760> now<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.090> doesn't<00:02:15.330> actually<00:02:15.420> matter

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
points now so it doesn't actually matter

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
points now so it doesn't actually matter
if<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.230> don't<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> lot<00:02:16.770> out<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.330> because

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
if I don't get a lot out of it because

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
