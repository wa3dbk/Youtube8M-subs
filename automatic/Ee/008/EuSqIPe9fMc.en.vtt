00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.780
 voodoo 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:16.760
 It is today luck Yes is safe and the Ryota both ne Yes very much Sha But only 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:23.150
 I would like to introduce mouse trumpet 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:28.449
 Then mouse trumpet will actually look like this 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.449
 Boone oh oh oh 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.989
 bap 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.989
 I wondered if this trumpet is 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:45.200
 No, not like Kaiserslautern doing something special 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:51.620
 I already use the amount of breath and the back voice after that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.650
 The voice of the back voice-I just want to play this trumpet sound just hold this 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.440
 Well then 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:01.680
 I will explain the way immediately 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.610
 First of all let's create a mouth shape but this is from the side 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.400
 Please make a horizontal little gap lips 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.890
 A gap that allows air to pass through 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:19.380
 Yes please make a gap now 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.440
 Let's say that the second one is wind in the back voice 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440
 Hmm 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:32.310
 Yes this is only then let's go to the third 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:36.420
 The third one is the side I made from the side of the lip I made at the first one 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.909
 Please try to outspoke from this side 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.399
 Hoh 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.729
 At this time please shake the side lip a little at this time . 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.729
 Poop 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:55.430
 Yes This is the completion of the mouse trumpet I such that I want you to keep in mind in this 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:02.720
 But please be careful when you put out this plan pet 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 It is the strength of exhaling breath. This is too weak or too strong . 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.039
 Please adjust it 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.260
 So the last thing is, but the sound of trumpet is trumpet 's 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.510
 Tend to use at turn on 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:23.300
 I think everyone will be, but you can also incorporate it into the beat. 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.300
 It will look like this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:36.350
 Make 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.730
 If you say trumpet lead in, you will feel a little fashionable 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.120
 So why don't you introduce them to REIT? 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.540
 Well then, today's beat box course will be here 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.940
 We also look forward to your request 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.560
 c Hesshin 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.640
 There was a great place 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.640
