00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello delights and co-creator it's 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.210
 where I am today 21 of my 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.679
 challenge of the 100 days I decided to 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.650
 launch this challenge is to do it in 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.509
 French this time so I'm in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.380
 we are Monday, January 21st I 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.210
 started January 1st and I must say that 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.050
 it has helped me a lot since 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.810
 beginning of the year to set me goals to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.340
 go all the way to a little motivated the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 morning because sometimes I'm I was 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.020
 not necessarily in the good one in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.010
 the right state of mind and it really has me 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.690
 ok permit no it must be that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.520
 I make this challenge I want to do this 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.200
 challenge and I know the benefits 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.730
 world sold after so many 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.940
 seasons that I think you have season 23 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.670
 or 24 24 so 100 x 24 2400 day soon 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.309
 of the dauphinÃ© his hallucinating player and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.100
 this time I decided to use the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.189
 little diary of the challenge is so for the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.260
 first time did I get 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.450
 realized in fact is that as and when 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.979
 as the days go by so I fill in my 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.420
 intentions I choose the different 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.939
 the different practices that I'm going 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.710
 finally put up that I that I'm going 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.009
 more or less do that kind of then I 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.420
 do it without too many rules and without 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.570
 put pressure on me because I know 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.180
 that it does not work but I put in all 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.240
 briefly actually I force myself at least 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.100
 he spent a minute or two in the morning and 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 which is good with the fact 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.360
 to use this journal is that in the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 I blame myself when I have not done 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.150
 a day 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.590
 and if I miss a day or two but 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.869
 I am trying to return to this day 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.700
 and at the and as in the end actually he 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.980
 must write the results the success this 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.440
 what happened what we did 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.720
 and in fact what we are 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.150
 grateful at the end of the day 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.950
 it's a must oblige me to find 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.290
 even the days that I could miss a little 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.880
 what happened and that's where I 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.020
 realize how much because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.610
 it's not something I had 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.920
 used the newspaper I knew the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.020
 profits by the participants but there 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.360
 I realized that by putting his 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.760
 different things 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.190
 at the end of the day just and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.830
 damn surprise in fact of all these 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.960
 miracles all these things that happen 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.820
 go bogged there are plenty of things in 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.320
 done since my challenge this time 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.690
 it's really about creating partnerships 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.690
 which is successful because I want to 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.950
 really create a team 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.260
 I also want to go back to sport 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.390
 and my sport is a big word 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.040
 because I want to go back to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.390
 yoga but I dragged feet and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.500
 today it's really the first 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.560
 day where I started doing a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.420
 first yoga session this morning and I 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.190
 do well to do that but it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.240
 really makes me challenge the sounds days 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.190
 forced to do certain things that 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.670
 walk like the vision board there 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.590
 that I did it I do them where I have 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.410
 stuck a lot of things that I like 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.940
 but but that was in practice and at 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.500
 the written and daily at the dock 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.910
 what does she do with me? 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.440
 if my intention for example more to 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.330
 Friday it was to be productive 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.330
 to be effective 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:22.650
 loÃ¯c rÃ©my I even put words in 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.020
 English recounts told to still loving a 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.430
 every day game actually I write them in 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.950
 French in English 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.120
 circle jean at the end of the day there 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.270
 has been full of beautiful things 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.280
 it was full full of beautiful 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.370
 things when for example a day down that 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.050
 I'm not in mood hockey 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.270
 today I really 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.730
 feel relaxed I feel good I am 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.650
 love sense of life and nothing but 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.000
 ask that intention while it's 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 a day that is not necessarily good 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.910
 started we feel we are we are of a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.410
 mood a little good there is the slightest thing 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.440
 it will go 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.440
 alas no no no no no in the shot 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.790
 it really helped me age and I'm I 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.430
 I felt really serene 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.110
 past days and I'm delighted 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.700
 I'm delighted it's crazy when we when we 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.830
 loose the practices and after when we 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.240
 decide to get back 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.310
 and then I say practical but frankly 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.170
 it's mostly for me to hold this 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.910
 newspaper do the videos blogs and there 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.549
 it's the first video blog I make 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.670
 yeah so we're the day 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.350
 21st day I decided to create a 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.240
 new youtube page just to put 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.460
 my catwalk videos are days like 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.050
 that people who do not want 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.730
 especially about who follow me 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.130
 on youtube is about interviews they 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.320
 are not watching I really do 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.550
 for me because that but it makes me 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.960
 do the videos love if you do not 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.790
 videos blogs really plays I you 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.210
 recommend it because it makes 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.460
 well say it to give his intentions 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.930
 to ask them to talk about his failures to 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.390
 what works does not work 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.640
 revitalizes the parade 100 days a lot 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.780
 of people do it in anonymous and there 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.940
 No worries I understand very well 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.300
 that it can not work not for all 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.940
 the world 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.610
 otherwise way blogs or even write 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.590
 his diary tribute very much his own 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.840
 newspaper 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:11.160
 So here 21 day bah listen 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.919
 frankly there are many beautiful things 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.440
 there are many beautiful people 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.210
 that I have to say to myself and then it's in 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.250
 this state of mind of if I asked 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.760
 the intention is good I know it's okay 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.490
 happen 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.740
 and I'm waiting for those people where these 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.690
 things come up and so that's me 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.710
 allows to be really positive or 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.310
 less than 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.490
 to keep this intention to know 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.830
 his goals and of and just me 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.540
 relax in its objectives by having 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.860
 trust what it's that's huge what 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.790
 I tend to be negative 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.410
 I tend to have big doubt 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.140
 to be easily in the analysis the 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.790
 panic i and the intellect and all that and 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.530
 I really want to follow my 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.400
 intuitions to develop his intuitions 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:00.450
 even more letting go of opening my 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.000
 heart of all these experiences there so 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.890
 that's in any case it's very positive and 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.240
 I can not wait to make more videos 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.920
 think I'll do in the future 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.410
 videos of my iphone and then I have them 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.590
 would put directly on youtube as 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.720
 it's just fast it's 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.940
 was quickly done it's quick 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.460
 pleasure too I had to redo 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.500
 a recap a little every 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.560
 things that had happened since the 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.230
 season one of the 100 day challenge so 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.770
 ie in 2005 2006 and it's crazy 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.330

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.740
 videos to leave them in the cross I 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.290
 let the first videos and 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.130
 then to look at years older 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.540
 late I tell myself that it has progressed well and 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.100
 that at the same time I still have 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.150
