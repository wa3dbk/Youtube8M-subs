00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hey hello nice that you look again we go 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.319
 today an adolescent mask make this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.389
 mask comes a you 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 and it is often used at 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.130
 Weddings get the skin after the color 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.330
 good and if used more often per week 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.330
 such as acne come 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.930
 a container where you can do nothing if I can 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.820
 big spoon and I both walked 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 chickpea flour that you can buy from 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 ekoplaza 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.809
 and curcuma for the hydration a glass 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.530
 milk and not to forget 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.480
 almond oil first scoop 2 full 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.840
 tablespoons of chickpea flour 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840
 in the container 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.220
 then do two tablespoons 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.320
 curcuma curcuma in the container 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.210
 well I do n't really have much of them 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.270
 very handy but that is actually also possible 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.520
 so is about the content of my jar 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.510
 about two teaspoons 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.250
 the name i cnet bit together 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.830
 Well as you can see I still have a small one 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.390
 bit and then I do it too 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.390
 yes all bits help of course 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.920
 and then you just go a little further 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.350
 stir and you will find some milk in you 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.540
 and I do it a bit by feeling 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.600
 so there can always be a lot with you but the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.750
 few not so much out of so much milk I have 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.090
 talk about it and now you start mixing everything 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.640
 until a good mixture 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.010
 so mix mix and mix again 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.330
 as you can see I have more people 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.320
 not really very good it is one 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.690
 kind of milky 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.830
 so i have what i looked there is flowers 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.510
 done with 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.280
 and eventually you get this fat 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.770
 mixture 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.229
 that's how thick it should be around 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.000
 can be a bit thicker but certainly not anymore 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.680
 milky there 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.900
 it is not necessary but I think so 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.180
 always nice you can add almond oil 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.310
 and then you do about a bottom 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.640
 from a teaspoon 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:11.930
 and then just pour it into the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:15.730
 packet and then how you like it 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.730
 sorry but you are having a good time today 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.750
 this is the final result 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.040
 if you don't want a mask right away 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.010
 usually you can always put it in the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.570
 you can do the remaining milk in the fridge 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.700
 q but we do 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.320
 warming up in the microwave does not know that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.980
 very tasty but it is very good 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.980
 very good for your skin 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.300
 enjoy your mask and see you soon
