00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.930
 hello guys and girls today we are in a 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.760
 new video and I am Saturday and good 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.740
 Many people asked me for this pack of mods 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:27.280
 that is a for pepe mostly and good 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.800
 the first is the status what it does is 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.040
 tell us how much we have the effect of 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.430
 a potion can be from anyone now 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.430
 from venero 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.890
 invisibility law 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.690
 and I love your mother of milk because if not 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.130
 it bothered me and well the only thing you do 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 this is to not have that was peeling 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.590
 the aei is to live what I have that is missing 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.190
 two minutes and the position will be finished and 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.579
 good is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.640
 it's very useful for me it 's great for the 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.920
 pp later there is the status tree that 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.720
 what are we going to see is this all this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.240
 what do you mean the doors utility 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.700
 we have here armor 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.880
 I'm talking to eta to get us the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.140
 creative 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.890
 and has like there are five levels of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.759
 armor the helmet is in red 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.729
 bloody a little more that is going to 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.520
 leave and it ends the whole chest is 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.189
 in stable or normal as you can tell 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.049
 the pants are already a little bit 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.600
 you have to go to win with a zoom that already 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.890
 and the boots that are saying help me 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 in repair and the last the fifth 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.340
 constant is new there I remove it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.650
 well let's start with all this to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.580
 course of food and some performances with 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.580
 the shovel the same is down there 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 84 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.850
 good is what makes it less 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.520
 well if you do not need one 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.510
 I'll prepare it well let's leave 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.510
 this armor 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.769
 the peaceful second 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.600
 clear grades good clear and now come with 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.720
 the arch 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 yes because quite often the arrows and I 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.030
 says the long arrows and the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.060
 arch durability 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.060
 seven arrows 377 uses 26 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.620
 now let's try 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.410
 the experience and I was good now but 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.540
 as casualties 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.420
 when you're stuck or you will quickly lower the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 armor but that's how it is 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.000
 today die 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.790
 the best woman 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.659
 to see if it drops from 2 to 1 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.659
 why 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.670
 I wish the connected 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.170
 and the other is the mask that many 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.690
 they think that it created them as they wanted 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.390
 put it with these and some do not 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.940
 works directly these two I'm going to 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.720

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.200

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.460

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.800

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.400
 these 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.400
 Hello 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.540
 and well now let's try the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.819
 is up there on the right 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.630
 how the entities carry it and all that 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.540
 with that is configured being the one 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.030
 trust and here where where says all let 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.680
 it and nothing there they put the key in want 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.660
 put on it or because that less 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.609
 it bothers me and it's easy to play so 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.620
 good guys now in a few minutes we 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.370
 we see on a server to test the 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.669
 multiplayer of climates 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.160
 and the armor and all the games in 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.740
 Five good little monkeys like you 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.419
 I said here we are on a server as you see 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.120
 on the map it is indicating where 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.249
 the players are going to make him blue 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.999
 and let's see how they move 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:38.999
 but giving 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.080
 and now this is what they asked me 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.490
 multiplayer that many do not get 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.919
 that is 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.680
 no better not because you are at my house but 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.529
 nothing I prefer 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.609
 spring 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:01.619
 was this the way many do not find it 

00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:03.539
 I'm going to put description the whole king 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:07.889
 minimum the status weapon the f that 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:10.889
 optimal and safe status I made another 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:14.099
 I can add it or if it exists 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.339
 some guide of something can ask me in 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.979
 the description of the video and well this is 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.839
 everything for today and I hope that you have 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.180
 liked the video is short but there's no 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:29.460
 Much to talk about are a couple of mods 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.460
