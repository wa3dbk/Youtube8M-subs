00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
fantastic in 3d as well but it's

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.350

gameplay<00:06:09.430> tweaks<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:09.940> have<00:06:10.030> noticed

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
gameplay tweaks that have noticed

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.939 
gameplay tweaks that have noticed
throughout<00:06:10.479> my<00:06:10.630> first<00:06:10.870> playthrough<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.440> game

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
throughout my first playthrough the game

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.469 
throughout my first playthrough the game
the<00:06:12.159> big<00:06:12.340> one<00:06:12.520> is<00:06:12.639> that<00:06:12.669> some<00:06:12.970> bosses<00:06:13.180> have

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
the big one is that some bosses have

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.850 
the big one is that some bosses have
slight<00:06:13.720> changes<00:06:14.139> to<00:06:14.229> their<00:06:14.349> behavior<00:06:14.770> and

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
slight changes to their behavior and

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.800 
slight changes to their behavior and
attack<00:06:15.159> patterns<00:06:15.639> which<00:06:16.030> mostly<00:06:16.419> encourage

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
attack patterns which mostly encourage

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.469 
attack patterns which mostly encourage
the<00:06:16.990> usage<00:06:17.349> of<00:06:17.470> links<00:06:17.770> masks<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.880> biggest<00:06:19.270> and

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
the usage of links masks the biggest and

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.270 
the usage of links masks the biggest and
most<00:06:19.570> appreciated<00:06:20.289> change<00:06:20.530> my<00:06:20.770> opinion<00:06:21.159> is

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
most appreciated change my opinion is

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.250 
most appreciated change my opinion is
York<00:06:21.729> which<00:06:22.090> was<00:06:22.270> never<00:06:22.419> too<00:06:22.690> hard<00:06:22.900> to<00:06:23.050> beat

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
York which was never too hard to beat

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.050 
York which was never too hard to beat
but<00:06:23.710> was<00:06:23.830> incredibly<00:06:24.280> frustrating<00:06:24.940> with

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
but was incredibly frustrating with

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.820 
but was incredibly frustrating with
terrible<00:06:25.419> camera<00:06:25.720> controls<00:06:26.199> in<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:26.409> original

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
terrible camera controls in the original

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.830 
terrible camera controls in the original
without<00:06:27.370> spoiling<00:06:27.849> the<00:06:28.060> surprise<00:06:28.180> you'll

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
without spoiling the surprise you'll

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.810 
without spoiling the surprise you'll
definitely<00:06:29.409> be<00:06:29.530> using<00:06:29.860> your<00:06:29.979> Zora<00:06:30.220> for<00:06:30.490> more

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.399 
definitely be using your Zora for more
in<00:06:30.940> this<00:06:31.060> fight<00:06:31.300> I<00:06:31.599> played<00:06:32.110> through<00:06:32.320> the

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
in this fight I played through the

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:33.960 
in this fight I played through the
entire<00:06:32.440> game<00:06:32.919> and<00:06:33.159> just<00:06:33.310> about<00:06:33.460> every<00:06:33.699> quest

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
entire game and just about every quest

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.670 
entire game and just about every quest
but<00:06:34.300> there's<00:06:34.510> just<00:06:34.690> one<00:06:34.810> thing<00:06:35.289> that<00:06:35.320> threw<00:06:35.620> me

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
but there's just one thing that threw me

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.550 
but there's just one thing that threw me
off<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:36.219> stone<00:06:36.760> mask<00:06:37.120> normally<00:06:37.990> you'll<00:06:38.289> find

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
off the stone mask normally you'll find

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.260 
off the stone mask normally you'll find
the<00:06:38.650> stone<00:06:38.889> mask<00:06:39.130> using<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.610> mask<00:06:39.820> of<00:06:40.000> true

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
the stone mask using the mask of true

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.620 
the stone mask using the mask of true
that

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
that

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.080 
that
spot<00:06:41.050> right<00:06:41.320> here<00:06:41.680> I<00:06:41.860> played<00:06:42.520> this<00:06:42.640> game<00:06:42.730> so

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
spot right here I played this game so

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.550 
spot right here I played this game so
often<00:06:43.510> that<00:06:43.660> it<00:06:43.810> actually<00:06:44.110> freaked<00:06:44.410> me<00:06:44.530> out

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
often that it actually freaked me out

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.200 
often that it actually freaked me out
when<00:06:44.770> I<00:06:44.830> couldn't<00:06:45.130> find<00:06:45.310> it<00:06:45.550> I<00:06:45.730> thought<00:06:45.970> it<00:06:46.090> was

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
when I couldn't find it I thought it was

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.910 
when I couldn't find it I thought it was
a<00:06:46.240> glitch<00:06:46.510> I<00:06:46.780> had<00:06:46.930> a<00:06:46.960> bad<00:06:47.200> copy<00:06:47.470> of<00:06:47.680> the<00:06:47.740> game

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
a glitch I had a bad copy of the game

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.070 
a glitch I had a bad copy of the game
without<00:06:48.760> ruining<00:06:49.000> the<00:06:49.210> new<00:06:49.450> location<00:06:49.960> of<00:06:50.050> the

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
without ruining the new location of the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.050 
without ruining the new location of the
mask<00:06:50.320> too<00:06:50.620> much<00:06:50.830> all<00:06:51.250> I<00:06:51.310> can<00:06:51.610> say<00:06:51.790> is<00:06:51.850> that<00:06:52.030> you

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
mask too much all I can say is that you

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.910 
mask too much all I can say is that you
can<00:06:52.270> find<00:06:52.510> the<00:06:52.630> stone<00:06:52.870> mask<00:06:53.110> in<00:06:53.380> the<00:06:53.590> area

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
can find the stone mask in the area

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.980 
can find the stone mask in the area
where<00:06:54.190> you<00:06:54.310> would<00:06:54.430> probably<00:06:55.090> need<00:06:55.270> it<00:06:55.450> most

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
where you would probably need it most

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.110 
where you would probably need it most
but<00:06:56.530> aside<00:06:56.740> from<00:06:56.800> a<00:06:56.980> few<00:06:57.010> minor<00:06:57.190> changes<00:06:57.520> this

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
but aside from a few minor changes this

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.550 
but aside from a few minor changes this
is<00:06:58.240> the<00:06:58.360> same<00:06:58.600> Majora's<00:06:58.960> Mask<00:06:59.230> that<00:06:59.440> we've
