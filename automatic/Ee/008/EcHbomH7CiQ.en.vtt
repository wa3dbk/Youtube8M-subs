I've<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.109> been<00:00:22.260> bowling<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.859> well<00:00:23.359> at

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I've just been bowling really well at

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
I've just been bowling really well at
southpoint<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.170> bowling<00:00:25.529> ball<00:00:25.560> has<00:00:25.830> always

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
southpoint my bowling ball has always

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.259 
southpoint my bowling ball has always
rolled<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:27.240> well<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.310> I<00:00:29.310> put<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> down

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
rolled very well there so I put it down

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.580 
rolled very well there so I put it down
to<00:00:30.390> more<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> house<00:00:30.929> rather<00:00:31.260> than<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to more the house rather than the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.130 
to more the house rather than the
patterns<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.279> southpoint<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.660> house<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
patterns at southpoint this house that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
patterns at southpoint this house that
was<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.440> tough<00:00:34.739> house<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:36.120> not

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
was a really tough house so I'm not

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110 
was a really tough house so I'm not
really<00:00:36.750> too<00:00:37.710> confident<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.670> lanes<00:00:38.940> are

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
really too confident that the lanes are

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780 
really too confident that the lanes are
longer<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.629> loyal<00:00:40.170> length<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.610> house

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
longer in loyal length I know the house

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.250 
longer in loyal length I know the house
characteristics<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> come<00:00:43.110> into

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
characteristics are going to come into

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
characteristics are going to come into
play<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.530> little<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.420> gonna<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
play a little more here gonna have to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
play a little more here gonna have to
bring<00:00:45.750> my<00:00:45.899> spare<00:00:46.200> ball<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> few<00:00:46.890> more<00:00:47.070> times

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
bring my spare ball out a few more times

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.299 
bring my spare ball out a few more times
i<00:00:47.670> hope<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.149> i<00:00:48.239> did<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:49.379> southpoint<00:00:50.100> just

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
i hope that i did it at southpoint just

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
i hope that i did it at southpoint just
because<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.879> mean<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> scoring<00:00:51.960> pace<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.320> going

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
because I mean the scoring pace is going

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100 
because I mean the scoring pace is going
to<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:52.800> lower<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.420> I<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> throw

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to be a little lower and I have to throw

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.819 
to be a little lower and I have to throw
a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.800> more<00:00:56.340> better<00:00:56.489> shots<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.829> swing

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
a lot a lot more better shots this swing

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
a lot a lot more better shots this swing
than<00:00:59.039> i<00:00:59.100> did<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> World<00:00:59.789> Series<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
than i did that the World Series so I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
than i did that the World Series so I
think<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.710> probably<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.280> I'm<00:01:02.399> most

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
think that's probably what I'm most

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.359 
think that's probably what I'm most
excited<00:01:02.730> about<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.570> honest<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.379> it's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
excited about to be honest is that it's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.100 
excited about to be honest is that it's
not<00:01:05.519> necessarily<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.659> higher

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
not necessarily going to be as higher

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.770 
not necessarily going to be as higher
scoring<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.060> good<00:01:09.060> shots<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> come

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
scoring so good shots are going to come

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
scoring so good shots are going to come
into<00:01:09.900> play<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.350> feel<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.770> good<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> feel

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
into play and I feel really good I feel

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
into play and I feel really good I feel
confident<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.409> that's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
confident in that and I think that's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
confident in that and I think that's
what's<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.979> set<00:01:14.189> me<00:01:14.340> apart<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
what's going to set me apart is is just

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
what's going to set me apart is is just

throughout the qualifying rounds it's a
