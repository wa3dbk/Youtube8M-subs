00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.669 

I'm<00:00:00.890> doing<00:00:01.340> a<00:00:01.520> physics<00:00:02.240> a<00:00:02.690> dedicated<00:00:03.260> PhysX

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679 
I'm doing a physics a dedicated PhysX

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.709 
I'm doing a physics a dedicated PhysX
card<00:00:03.940> testbench<00:00:04.940> the<00:00:05.839> primary<00:00:06.200> card<00:00:06.500> is<00:00:06.799> a

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:07.719 
card testbench the primary card is a

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.939 
card testbench the primary card is a
EVGA<00:00:08.719> gtx<00:00:09.619> 560<00:00:09.919> and<00:00:10.690> the<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:12.349> dedicated<00:00:12.739> PhysX

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:12.949 
EVGA gtx 560 and the the dedicated PhysX

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.929 
EVGA gtx 560 and the the dedicated PhysX
card<00:00:13.099> it's<00:00:13.369> an<00:00:13.459> older<00:00:13.759> 260<00:00:14.480> GTX<00:00:14.929> from<00:00:15.379> I<00:00:15.980> think

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
card it's an older 260 GTX from I think

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.210 
card it's an older 260 GTX from I think
this<00:00:17.029> one's<00:00:17.240> from<00:00:17.509> VFG<00:00:18.019> tech<00:00:18.230> but<00:00:18.920> it's<00:00:19.039> based

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
this one's from VFG tech but it's based

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.390 
this one's from VFG tech but it's based
off<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.519> reference<00:00:19.820> design<00:00:20.919> eight<00:00:21.919> gigs<00:00:22.250> of

ddr3 RAM running at 1600 FX 4100 CPU and
I<00:00:29.480> think<00:00:29.659> it's<00:00:29.779> clocked<00:00:30.050> at<00:00:30.199> 3.6<00:00:31.099> with<00:00:31.460> boost

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
I think it's clocked at 3.6 with boost

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.209 
I think it's clocked at 3.6 with boost
up<00:00:31.849> to<00:00:31.970> 4.2<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:34.180> bunch<00:00:35.180> fans<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.289> 650<00:00:36.920> watt<00:00:37.010> power

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
up to 4.2 a bunch fans a 650 watt power

up to 4.2 a bunch fans a 650 watt power
source<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.910> did<00:00:38.090> have<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.359> use<00:00:38.390> these<00:00:38.690> from

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
source and I did have to use these from

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.240 
source and I did have to use these from
Oh<00:00:38.960> Linux<00:00:39.230> adapters<00:00:39.649> which<00:00:39.770> I've<00:00:39.890> never<00:00:40.070> had

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
Oh Linux adapters which I've never had

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.920 
Oh Linux adapters which I've never had
to<00:00:40.309> use<00:00:40.340> before<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:41.120> power<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.629> bottom<00:00:41.840> one

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
to use before to power the bottom one

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.630 
to use before to power the bottom one
I'm<00:00:41.989> surprised<00:00:42.260> too<00:00:42.500> it<00:00:42.890> actually<00:00:43.039> posted<00:00:43.520> up

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
I'm surprised too it actually posted up

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.830 
I'm surprised too it actually posted up
this<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.289> motherboard<00:00:45.710> is<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:45.980> m5<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:47.000> 97

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
this and the motherboard is a m5 a 97

00:00:47.840 --> 00:01:01.299 
this and the motherboard is a m5 a 97
right<00:00:58.420> as<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.570> can<00:00:59.690> see<00:00:59.870> right<00:01:00.019> here<00:01:00.309> I'm

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
right as you can see right here I'm

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.250 
right as you can see right here I'm
switching<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.850> dedicated<00:01:02.329> PhysX<00:01:02.570> card<00:01:02.719> to

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
from the 560 find the change and just

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.110 
from the 560 find the change and just
remote<00:01:14.450> well<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.780> forget<00:01:15.320> Portland's<00:01:16.120> okay

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
remote well I forget Portland's okay

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.550 
remote well I forget Portland's okay
it's<00:01:17.330> just<00:01:17.420> launching<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.200> I'm<00:01:18.290> trying<00:01:18.500> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
it's just launching and I'm trying to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.840 
it's just launching and I'm trying to
aim<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.770> camera<00:01:18.950> there<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.430> can<00:01:19.550> see<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
aim the camera there you can see the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.970 
aim the camera there you can see the
frames<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:20.660> is<00:01:20.780> only<00:01:20.960> because<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:21.890> a

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
frames and that is only because it's a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.860

I'll do a test I did it in a 1080 that's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.440 
I'll do a test I did it in a 1080 that's
Jesus<00:01:40.850> Christ<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:43.280> got<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.610> noticed<00:01:44.000> uh<00:01:44.150> I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.110 

this<00:02:44.110> video<00:02:44.379> might<00:02:44.650> run<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.860> little<00:02:44.920> bit<00:02:45.159> long

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.509 

and<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.110> getting<00:02:49.410> lower<00:02:49.800> frames<00:02:50.129> because

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
and it is getting lower frames because

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.300 
and it is getting lower frames because
it's<00:02:50.879> running<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.120> 1080<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> non<00:02:53.069> TI

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's running on 1080 this is the non TI

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.009 
it's running on 1080 this is the non TI
version<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.910> five<00:02:54.090> safety<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.870> not

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
version of the five safety so it's not

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.390 
version of the five safety so it's not
that<00:02:55.080> high<00:02:55.709> performance<00:02:56.220> retarded<00:02:56.670> mmm

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
that high performance retarded mmm

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.720 
that high performance retarded mmm
alright

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.259 

wait<00:03:07.330> there's<00:03:07.690> nobody<00:03:07.989> here<00:03:08.530> okay<00:03:09.190> there<00:03:10.180> we

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
wait there's nobody here okay there we

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.330 
wait there's nobody here okay there we
go

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
go

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:22.250 
go
maybe<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> seal<00:03:12.270> without<00:03:12.480> fighting

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.119 

see<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:22.980> dipping<00:03:23.159> to<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:24.409> about<00:03:25.409> 43<00:03:25.890> frames

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
see it's dipping to the about 43 frames

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.259 
see it's dipping to the about 43 frames
that's<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> second<00:03:27.209> ago<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.150> very

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
that's not a second ago but it's very

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.110 
that's not a second ago but it's very
smooth<00:03:32.120> or<00:03:33.120> yes<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.629> just<00:03:33.659> dipped<00:03:33.959> into<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.200> 30s

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
smooth or yes I just dipped into the 30s

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.949 
smooth or yes I just dipped into the 30s
this<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.269> with<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.019> GTX<00:03:37.799> 260<00:03:38.129> SD<00:03:38.959> dedicated

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
all right wow it's one of in the water

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.300 
all right wow it's one of in the water
it<00:03:54.780> does<00:03:54.930> get<00:03:55.140> pretty<00:03:55.170> locusts<00:03:55.830> dealing<00:03:56.160> with

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
it does get pretty locusts dealing with

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.030 
it does get pretty locusts dealing with
the<00:03:56.570> collision<00:03:59.900> alright<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.140> will<00:04:01.680> pause<00:04:01.860> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
the collision alright I will pause the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.170 
the collision alright I will pause the
video<00:04:02.220> here<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.700> change<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.570> settings

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
video here and change the settings

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
gonna watch game again we're back we're

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.920 
gonna watch game again we're back we're
loading<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:19.980> up<00:04:20.100> right<00:04:20.220> now<00:04:20.400> with<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.330> 560

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
loading it up right now with the the 560

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.250 
loading it up right now with the the 560
dedicated<00:04:22.530> PhysX<00:04:22.830> card<00:04:25.610> okay<00:04:26.610> let's<00:04:26.850> let<00:04:27.030> this

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
dedicated PhysX card okay let's let this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.960 
dedicated PhysX card okay let's let this
so<00:04:28.260> you're<00:04:28.380> seeing<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.680> your<00:04:29.610> frame<00:04:29.820> is<00:04:29.940> just

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
so you're seeing that your frame is just

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.710 
so you're seeing that your frame is just
naturally<00:04:30.540> about<00:04:30.780> 10<00:04:31.140> frames<00:04:31.290> lower<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:33.540> dips

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
naturally about 10 frames lower it dips

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.510 
naturally about 10 frames lower it dips
down<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.930> lot<00:04:34.110> quicker<00:04:34.140> you're<00:04:35.130> not<00:04:35.250> seeing<00:04:35.460> a

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
down a lot quicker you're not seeing a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.390 
down a lot quicker you're not seeing a
huge<00:04:35.880> improvement<00:04:36.210> with<00:04:36.630> that<00:04:36.750> card<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.200> a

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
huge improvement with that card is a

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.010 
huge improvement with that card is a
dedicated<00:04:38.400> PhysX<00:04:38.580> card<00:04:38.730> but<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:39.720> enough<00:04:39.930> to

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
dedicated PhysX card but it's enough to

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.220 
dedicated PhysX card but it's enough to
make<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.170> difference<00:04:41.840> I'll<00:04:42.840> do<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> same

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
make a difference I'll do the same

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.130 
make a difference I'll do the same
run-through<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.680> just<00:04:44.190> did

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.490 

yeah<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:50.830> is<00:04:50.950> quite<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.490> bit<00:04:51.670> lower

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
yeah it is quite a bit lower

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.290 
yeah it is quite a bit lower
and<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.610> only<00:04:54.760> reason<00:04:54.970> I'm<00:04:55.030> making<00:04:55.090> this

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
and the only reason I'm making this

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.910 
and the only reason I'm making this
video<00:04:55.420> because<00:04:55.570> if<00:04:55.840> you're<00:04:55.960> upgrading<00:04:56.170> and

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
video because if you're upgrading and

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.970 
video because if you're upgrading and
you<00:04:57.190> don't<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:57.490> want<00:04:57.670> to<00:04:57.700> put<00:04:57.940> your<00:04:58.710> 260<00:04:59.710> or

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
you don't just want to put your 260 or

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.800 
you don't just want to put your 260 or
whatever<00:05:00.220> on<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.370> Shelf<00:05:00.670> this<00:05:01.540> could<00:05:01.720> be

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
whatever on the Shelf this could be

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.330 
whatever on the Shelf this could be
something<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.170> could<00:05:02.260> actually<00:05:02.410> be<00:05:02.650> used<00:05:02.830> for

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:14.480 

Sam<00:05:06.340> run<00:05:06.580> through<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.850> before

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.040 

let's<00:05:14.970> get<00:05:15.090> in<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.240> water<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.810> kind<00:05:15.960> of

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
let's get in the water to kind of

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.580 
let's get in the water to kind of
simulate<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.830> again<00:05:18.290> that's<00:05:19.290> kind<00:05:19.500> of

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
simulate that again that's kind of

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.750 
simulate that again that's kind of
strange<00:05:19.740> I'm<00:05:19.890> not<00:05:20.010> getting<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.250> same<00:05:20.460> reading

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
strange I'm not getting the same reading

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.620 
strange I'm not getting the same reading
so<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:20.910> was<00:05:21.000> getting<00:05:21.180> in<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.300> water<00:05:21.390> before

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
so I was getting in the water before

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.180 
so I was getting in the water before
before<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.230> was<00:05:22.350> stepping<00:05:22.590> down<00:05:22.830> into<00:05:23.100> the

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
before it was stepping down into the

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:35.890 
before it was stepping down into the
other<00:05:23.370> goes

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.739 

all<00:05:36.900> right

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:40.749 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.449 

yeah<00:05:41.379> you<00:05:41.529> are<00:05:41.649> getting<00:05:41.860> lower<00:05:41.979> frames<00:05:42.279> this

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:42.459 
yeah you are getting lower frames this

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:44.699 
yeah you are getting lower frames this
way<00:05:42.639> it's<00:05:43.269> not<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.419> sizable<00:05:43.839> difference<00:05:43.989> the

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:44.709 
way it's not a sizable difference the

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:45.529 
way it's not a sizable difference the
GTX

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
GTX

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.069 
GTX
-<00:05:46.709> yeah<00:05:47.709> the<00:05:47.799> 260<00:05:48.219> I'm<00:05:48.309> using<00:05:48.489> is<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:49.749> think<00:05:49.869> it's

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:50.079 
- yeah the 260 I'm using is I think it's

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.969 
- yeah the 260 I'm using is I think it's
the<00:05:50.610> 786<00:05:51.610> megabyte<00:05:52.029> version<00:05:52.799> it's<00:05:53.799> not

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
the 786 megabyte version it's not

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.079 
the 786 megabyte version it's not
overclocked<00:05:54.369> now<00:05:54.519> these<00:05:54.669> cards<00:05:54.909> are

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:55.089 
overclocked now these cards are

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:02.159 
overclocked now these cards are
overclocked<00:05:55.479> by<00:05:55.629> the<00:05:55.689> way<00:06:00.809> I'm<00:06:01.809> going<00:06:02.049> to<00:06:02.110> be

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
overclocked by the way I'm going to be

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.559 
overclocked by the way I'm going to be
getting<00:06:02.379> a<00:06:02.589> 660ti<00:06:03.519> soon<00:06:03.999> so<00:06:04.299> I'm<00:06:04.419> actually

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
getting a 660ti soon so I'm actually

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.729 
getting a 660ti soon so I'm actually
going<00:06:04.839> to<00:06:04.959> a<00:06:05.019> benchmark<00:06:05.259> with<00:06:05.589> the<00:06:06.689> the<00:06:07.689> 560<00:06:08.499> as

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:08.739 
going to a benchmark with the the 560 as

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:12.179 
going to a benchmark with the the 560 as
the<00:06:09.449> dedicated<00:06:10.449> PhysX<00:06:10.659> card<00:06:10.809> and<00:06:11.139> I'm<00:06:11.589> kind<00:06:12.129> of

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:12.189 
the dedicated PhysX card and I'm kind of

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:20.390 
the dedicated PhysX card and I'm kind of
curious<00:06:12.369> to<00:06:12.579> see<00:06:12.610> how<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:12.969> looks

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.450 

all<00:06:20.970> right<00:06:21.090> well<00:06:21.360> there<00:06:21.479> you<00:06:21.540> go<00:06:22.040> this<00:06:23.040> kind<00:06:23.430> of

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
all right well there you go this kind of

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.070 
all right well there you go this kind of
shows<00:06:23.669> you<00:06:23.910> how<00:06:25.160> how<00:06:26.160> it<00:06:26.280> works<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:27.080> you're

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
shows you how how it works and you're

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.280 
shows you how how it works and you're
getting<00:06:28.260> probably<00:06:28.620> on<00:06:28.979> average<00:06:29.280> 10<00:06:29.699> to<00:06:29.729> 20<00:06:30.570> and

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
getting probably on average 10 to 20 and

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.490 
getting probably on average 10 to 20 and
10<00:06:31.500> to<00:06:31.620> 15<00:06:31.889> frames<00:06:32.040> more<00:06:32.729> at<00:06:32.940> all<00:06:32.970> times<00:06:33.500> with

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
10 to 15 frames more at all times with

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.430 
10 to 15 frames more at all times with
the<00:06:34.770> 260<00:06:35.370> as<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.490> dedicated<00:06:36.210> PhysX<00:06:36.660> card<00:06:36.810> but<00:06:37.350> it

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
the 260 as a dedicated PhysX card but it

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.640 
the 260 as a dedicated PhysX card but it
is<00:06:37.560> taking<00:06:37.949> more<00:06:38.160> power<00:06:38.750> I'm<00:06:39.750> running<00:06:40.020> a<00:06:40.080> 650

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
is taking more power I'm running a 650

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.080 
is taking more power I'm running a 650
watt<00:06:40.740> power<00:06:40.949> source<00:06:41.310> and<00:06:43.729> it's<00:06:44.729> been<00:06:44.880> doing

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
watt power source and it's been doing

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.240 
watt power source and it's been doing
fun

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
fun

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.680 
fun
but<00:06:47.250> I<00:06:47.280> wouldn't<00:06:47.820> recommend<00:06:47.910> using<00:06:48.330> anything

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
but I wouldn't recommend using anything

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.450 
but I wouldn't recommend using anything
but<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:49.199> think<00:06:49.500> even<00:06:49.590> at<00:06:49.770> 6:30<00:06:50.220> would<00:06:50.370> be

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
but I think even at 6:30 would be

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.029 
but I think even at 6:30 would be
pushing<00:06:50.669> it<00:06:51.650> alright<00:06:52.650> well<00:06:52.770> thanks<00:06:52.949> for

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
pushing it alright well thanks for
