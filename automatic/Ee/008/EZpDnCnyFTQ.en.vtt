00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.500

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.750
 in an iron plate 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.220
 of course being through out 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.270
 according to an activist in Suriname Lilian 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.120
 we didn't make it in the end 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.120
 last year sold their 30 million records in June 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.630

 which led to traffic jams 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.439
 also an application 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.550
 I'm federating your path 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.840
 in london x 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.080

 he previously worked one 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 took it in 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.070
 much more 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.749
 currently think 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.779
 residents of the and each time the empire struggle that he has been to for several weeks 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.780
 are struggling with the poo packets lying around 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.930
 the excrements empty packaging newsprint on different 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.009
 cycle paths 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.109
 the municipality says it is busy with smelly things and all children 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.659
 to clean up carefully 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.709
 but the pop temple is still untraceable 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.409
 The municipality received June 13 is the power of a resident who reported 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.689
 several packed and already in the neighborhood 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.139

 according to the Eindhoven daily, the residents have been around for more than half a year 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.829
 infested with the many paper parcels with droppings 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.210
 it is still unclear yes 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.839
 unclearly easy to say whether it will work out at ten 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.969
 inhumane sources goes but newspaper reports that given the size of the 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.969
 packages the last option is the most obvious
