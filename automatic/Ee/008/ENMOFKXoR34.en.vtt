00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.380
 and what's wrong with his edicts returned 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.180
 with this new video we are here 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 today with the third part of the new 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.230
 raid of the end of crota and today 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.200
 I'm here to explain just how 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.049
 kill the dead song the witch that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 there is in this part of raid 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 we say that in itself very much 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 simple and now we start immediately before 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.850
 this part I wanted to explain to you that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.510
 however there is a short part in which 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.890
 I will spur slaves and shouters I have decided 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.480
 not to put that part because everything 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 added up is very very simple yes 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 understands on the fly just kill the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.090
 slaves and juliette of the screamer then 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 very simple there was no need to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.660
 make a video of it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.149
 having said that we leave immediately with the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.920
 technique that we used as 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.960
 you will see the gameplay is pretty much the I have it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 done the same day he succeeded 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.940
 dlc we are still all at trent level 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.829
 in this video I will even die myself 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 it seems two or even three times not 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.090
 I'm sure the technique is the one where 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 we are still today that we are all at 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.379
 31 very very simple to understand a little 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 more complicated to apply but not so 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.880
 difficult though guys then the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.080
 the technique we used was that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.990
 to divide us into these two towers we say 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.060
 which is dividing us into two groups of 3 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 we will start shooting the knights at 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.049
 maliarde that as you are seeing precisely 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.820
 in this parts camp once you have it 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.180
 killed the witch of the moment and ai 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.030
 knights together or rather from the left 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 that from the right we enter the center where there is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 is the arda shirt that obviously will have to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.790
 be there before you start singing 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.970
 otherwise it will be game over for everyone 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.100
 how many could destroy the screamer who 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 there is in the middle of the room and after that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.610
 feed the council as much as possible 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.770
 what I can give you is to use the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.439
 yellow run obviously upgraded to 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 maximum because it is probably the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.370
 most useful rocket launcher of the game and if 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.500
 you don't even know 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.600
 the straconsigliato of light weapons 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.720
 because you will do double the damage 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.700
 practically so yes the important thing is 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.000
 getting to the center is a very technique 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.560
 I don't know enough stupid though 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.899
 let's say the fastest we can 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.600
 at least I think if you have others 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.400
 well come we have been this fin 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.530
 from the beginning and we still are now that 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.050
 we are all a little at 31 comes a lot 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.150
 simpler than if it will be enough anyway 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.790
 just spamming rocket launchers and one 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.790
 time to have killed the maliarda that is the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.010
 sings dead the game will be made boys 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.640
 it will be enough to go back to the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.890
 columns and kill everyone else 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.930
 knights and all other acolytes who 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 they stayed so it will take a while 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.560
 time you will have to have a little patience there 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.110
 will take a while but all in all nothing 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.780
 impossible kids and therefore nothing 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.620
 this is the third part of this new one 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.510
 raid 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.730
 I hope to have been of help to you then 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.340
 nothing woes I leave you to the rest of the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.530
 video and we'll see you next time 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.620
 part that will be the end of your own crust 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.150
 in the true sense of the word and nothing 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.890
 invitation to leave a like a comment 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.550
 any advice if maybe you did 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.250
 in another way 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.690
 and here to say everything we give ourselves to a 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.690
 next nice video 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 a good 3 after the race 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.860
 never 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.170
 as was his skillful bike he will scare the area 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.190
 that I have to provide two centers like me 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.190
 Teramo means 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:07.050
 in the morning and stephen tonic water 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:11.070
 both freeway and queues I understand well 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.070
 little more than controversy 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.400
 no
