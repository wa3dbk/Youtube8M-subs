haven't seen it there is quite a few
caves<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.720> could<00:02:56.459> bleed<00:02:57.459> pretty<00:02:58.390> far

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
caves that could bleed pretty far

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.020 
caves that could bleed pretty far
so<00:03:00.990> it's<00:03:01.200> pretty<00:03:01.560> dark<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.130> I'm<00:03:02.580> just<00:03:02.880> going

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
so it's pretty dark and I'm just going

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.140 
so it's pretty dark and I'm just going
to<00:03:03.150> get<00:03:03.270> myself<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.840> torch<00:03:04.170> out<00:03:04.460> so<00:03:05.460> yeah<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to get myself a torch out so yeah it is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.800 
to get myself a torch out so yeah it is
it's<00:03:07.080> pretty<00:03:07.620> big<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.400> guys<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.450> guys<00:03:09.600> go

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
it's pretty big so you guys you guys go

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.420 
it's pretty big so you guys you guys go
explore<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> caves<00:03:10.650> yourself<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.160> don't<00:03:11.310> want

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
explore the caves yourself I don't want

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.210 
explore the caves yourself I don't want
to<00:03:11.520> spoil<00:03:11.760> too<00:03:11.910> much<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.590> guess<00:03:13.590> that's<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
to spoil too much but I guess that's the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.760 
to spoil too much but I guess that's the
end<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.390> review<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.560> just

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
end of the see review this this is just

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.680 
end of the see review this this is just
the<00:03:16.980> jungle<00:03:17.310> biome<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:17.760> if<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:18.360> keep<00:03:18.570> on

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the jungle biome and if you keep on

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.380 
the jungle biome and if you keep on
going<00:03:18.720> further<00:03:19.140> you'll<00:03:20.010> eventually<00:03:20.730> get<00:03:21.210> out

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
going further you'll eventually get out

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.520 
going further you'll eventually get out
but<00:03:21.660> as<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.170> could<00:03:22.910> recall<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.270> from<00:03:24.690> my<00:03:24.900> past

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
but as I could recall that from my past

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.740 
but as I could recall that from my past
episodes<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.400> my<00:03:26.520> survival<00:03:27.210> challenge<00:03:27.570> let's

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
episodes of my survival challenge let's

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
I randomly generated the seed and got

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.490 
I randomly generated the seed and got
got<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:47.090> explore<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.360> seed<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.930> find<00:03:49.350> out

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
got to explore this seed and find out

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.650 
got to explore this seed and find out
how<00:03:49.710> cool<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.190> was<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.580> here<00:03:50.940> straight<00:03:51.510> off
