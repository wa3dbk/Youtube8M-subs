00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:18.620
 The obi tie of the yukata introduces how to tie the flower culture which arranged the standard branch school 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:25.600
 It is a gorgeous obi tie of four feathers 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.600
 It's hard to stand out even if the shape collapses a little, so it's packed for beginners 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.589
 The end of the band 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.589
 Fold in half like this 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.329
 The part that has become 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:05.230
 It will be about 10 cm from the outside direction 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.659
 I will hold the hand here 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.619
 Who is the longer 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.460
 Lift and make a triangle shape 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.600
 I will fix it here 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 I will wrap the band 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.500
 I will wrap it firmly from the first lap 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.630
 When closed avia or 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.630
 It will not be too tighten and tighten focus on stomach 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.550
 If you open the door 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.550
 From the side of the neighborhood 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.369
 It will, depending on who the half 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.930
 The hand that I had deposited 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.550
 Tightly 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.550
 It will be this way out 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:16.530
 Make sure that the parts that are on are pulled out 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.530
 Tie one time as those of the hand comes to the top 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.560
 Wireless Darla over 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.830
 Not to loosen 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.830
 Twist and stop at the bottom of the chest 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.370
 Anyone because even etc. 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.370
 Firmly spread 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.790
 Shoulder width 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.790
 Make a feather 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.300
 Stack on the zig zag 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 At this time, if the two wings above are short, the finished balance will be good 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.730
 Next we will make the shape of the ribbon 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.370
 Make a hollow in the middle 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.630
 Up and down 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.630
 I will make two mountains 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.330
 If you can, put it on the knot above 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.739
 I have kept it 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.739
 I will wrap it with my hand 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.150
 Pull up firmly 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.849
 In the same way 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.610
 I will wrap it again 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.720
 If it closes firmly, it will be invited last 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.720
 Put in between bands 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.920
 Pull out from below 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.470
 It opens like this seven treasures that came out 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:32.500
 When it comes around too much, it stores the winding in the fire 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.110
 next 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.230
 Towards the lower part of the ribbon 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.440
 in this way 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:46.350
 I will count down 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.350
 The same goes for the other side 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.030
 Adjust the length 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.070
 It would be nice to be this same length 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.160
 next 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.590
 The smaller one 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.860
 Feather 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.610
 in this way 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.870
 Pretty 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.870
 I will launch 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:20.940
 It will be in the form of a obi tie with a sense of movement by doing so 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:24.190
 I will turn it back when the shape of the obi is finished 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.150
 Don't break the obi you just made 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.150
 Raise your right hand 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.520
 The it was Mii guard 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.520
 Don't turn 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.920
 I will go around myself 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.070
 I had seen you put in here if not with belt 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.690
 Insert the neck between days 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.380
 Finally 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.930
 Align the knot in the middle of your back 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.930
 It is the completion of flower paperback 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:26.350
 In the case of a reversible band 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.350
 in this way 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.360
 Only one 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.569
 Fold it diagonally 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.070
 I will put out the color of the back 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:43.510
 In this way to make the switch 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:43.510
 There is also an effect that looks up like a leg length in a slender look up 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.020
 If you have such a reference 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.960
 I made it earlier 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:58.289
 Anticipate the possibility to return 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.289
 It can also be an accent of one point 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:24.090
 If the band has loosened, it will be under the band with hand towel folded as a first aid 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.320
 By doing so, the waist gets thicker 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.320
 Band becomes stable
