have this actually set up with two
blinks<00:04:12.220> spells<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.380> one<00:04:15.130> would<00:04:15.310> tell<00:04:15.459> put

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
blinks spells so that one would tell put

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.250 
blinks spells so that one would tell put
you<00:04:15.820> in<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.030> X<00:04:16.209> Direction<00:04:16.660> one<00:04:16.870> will<00:04:17.019> teleport

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
you in the X Direction one will teleport

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.229 
you in the X Direction one will teleport
you<00:04:17.470> in<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> Z<00:04:18.100> direction<00:04:18.549> so<00:04:18.880> if<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.090> were<00:04:19.209> to

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
you in the Z direction so if I were to

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.590 
you in the Z direction so if I were to
say<00:04:19.359> grab<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> central<00:04:20.320> now<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:21.270> get<00:04:22.270> blink<00:04:22.539> z

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
say grab the central now I get blink z

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.810 
say grab the central now I get blink z
the<00:04:25.600> only<00:04:26.080> way<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:26.650> could<00:04:26.770> figure<00:04:27.220> out<00:04:27.370> how<00:04:27.760> to

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
the only way I could figure out how to

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.430 
the only way I could figure out how to
make<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.120> work<00:04:28.180> without<00:04:28.539> them<00:04:28.840> interfering

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
make this work without them interfering

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.880 
make this work without them interfering
with<00:04:29.470> each<00:04:29.620> other<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:31.630> have<00:04:31.810> these<00:04:32.440> two

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
with each other is to have these two

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.640 
with each other is to have these two
command<00:04:33.220> blocks<00:04:33.690> yeah<00:04:34.690> these<00:04:34.840> two<00:04:35.110> on<00:04:35.440> each

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
command blocks yeah these two on each

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.120 
command blocks yeah these two on each
one<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.880> one<00:04:37.120> destroys<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.770> redstone

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
one this one destroys this redstone

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.340 
one this one destroys this redstone
right<00:04:39.400> here<00:04:39.610> on<00:04:39.700> both<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:39.910> them<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.389> then

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
right here on both of them and then

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.200 
right here on both of them and then
replaces<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.160> red<00:04:42.310> star<00:04:42.490> on<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:42.760> opposite

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
replaces the red star on the opposite

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.260 
replaces the red star on the opposite
one<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:44.070> what<00:04:45.070> ends<00:04:45.250> up<00:04:45.310> happening<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.880> once

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
one and what ends up happening is once

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.350 
one and what ends up happening is once
the<00:04:46.570> clear<00:04:46.990> command<00:04:47.320> works<00:04:47.620> for<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.010> map

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
the clear command works for the map

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.029 
the clear command works for the map
it'll<00:04:49.360> go<00:04:49.479> through<00:04:49.750> here<00:04:50.110> delete<00:04:50.800> this

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
it'll go through here delete this

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.670 
it'll go through here delete this

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
place a redstone wire here so that it

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.540

well<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:10.389> know<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.570> learn<00:05:10.720> something<00:05:10.990> new

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
well you know you learn something new

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.680 
well you know you learn something new
every<00:05:11.200> day<00:05:11.410> but<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.430> way<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.580> we<00:05:13.000> thought<00:05:13.600> it

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
every day but the way I we thought it

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.230 
every day but the way I we thought it
was<00:05:13.780> going<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:13.960> work<00:05:14.020> as<00:05:14.260> blink<00:05:14.590> sorry<00:05:15.190> in<00:05:16.000> the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
was going to work as blink sorry in the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.630 
was going to work as blink sorry in the
z<00:05:16.450> direction

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
z direction

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:27.740 
z direction
so<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:24.070> then<00:05:24.430> link<00:05:24.850> X<00:05:25.570> in<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.830> X<00:05:26.860> direction

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
so and then link X in the X direction

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:36.300 
so and then link X in the X direction
but<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.810> suppose<00:05:29.530> both<00:05:34.140> best<00:05:35.140> pose<00:05:35.470> with<00:05:35.800> them

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
but I suppose both best pose with them

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.080 
but I suppose both best pose with them
only<00:05:37.060> one<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.330> them<00:05:37.510> going<00:05:37.780> at<00:05:38.080> one<00:05:38.710> time<00:05:39.090> you

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
only one of them going at one time you

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.490 
only one of them going at one time you
would<00:05:40.210> only<00:05:40.360> ever<00:05:40.720> need<00:05:41.080> one<00:05:42.510> as<00:05:43.510> one<00:05:44.140> this

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
would only ever need one as one this

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.300 
would only ever need one as one this
one's<00:05:44.710> going<00:05:44.920> it'll<00:05:45.820> trigger<00:05:46.000> this<00:05:47.310> stopping

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
one's going it'll trigger this stopping

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.110 
one's going it'll trigger this stopping
this<00:05:48.460> one<00:05:48.930> sign<00:05:49.930> of<00:05:50.080> something<00:05:50.320> this<00:05:50.770> one<00:05:51.120> and

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
this one sign of something this one and

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.070 
this one sign of something this one and
starting<00:05:53.020> up<00:05:53.110> this<00:05:53.290> one<00:05:53.880> so<00:05:54.880> you<00:05:55.810> would<00:05:55.930> only

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
starting up this one so you would only

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:06.719 
starting up this one so you would only
ever<00:05:56.380> need

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:29.230 

I<00:06:06.819> don't<00:06:07.419> know<00:06:07.479> what<00:06:07.599> happened<00:06:07.629> there

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:42.470 

and<00:06:31.810> we<00:06:32.810> need<00:06:33.050> to<00:06:33.110> fix<00:06:33.380> that
