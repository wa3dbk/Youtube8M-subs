00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.260
 one more day of racing in Galicia between 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.900
 the towns of santiago de 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.450
 Compostela and Ferrol with 173 kilometers 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.000
 exempt from great difficulties without 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.590
 However, the irregular profile of the terrain 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 accompanied by an uneven rhythm can 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.950
 cause the final result of the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.250
 stage be uncertain until your last 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.250
 compasses 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.809
 until in the head 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.510
 very combative leaves everything in each 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.510
 attack 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.260
 ah 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.260
 two 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.619
 ah 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.160
 squad has raised a little the foot the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.170
 The leader's team should not be too 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.580
 worried about the break in the group 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.580
 has reached the height of the escaped 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.280
 Y 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.140
 the practical brand of the peloton in these 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.670
 moments will surely contrast with the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.940
 fight that awaits us in the last 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.940
 kilometer 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.710
 or not 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:43.280
 runners are imposing a rhythm 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:44.870
 quite elevated lucid attack 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.920
 the head group is not well 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.450
 organized and they are taking advantage of it 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.450
 some cyclists to attack 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.870
 ah 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.010
 things are heating up in the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:13.269
 head of the group 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:16.500
 and the peloton is reducing its 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.500
 disadvantage with the escaped 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 we are going to miss 10 kilometers for the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.620
 final 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.769
 go fight to get a good 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.769
 position among the sprinters 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.630
 as there are 5 km open gap has 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.630
 good looking can win 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.739
 he really deserved the victory for his 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.560
 courage and combativity throughout the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.230
 day and there are runners to arrive 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.000
 to the goal we now offer you the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.569
 repetition of the decisive moments of 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.569
 today's test 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.600
