 How to sew a look back with slits 3 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.000
 Please draw a line to connect the mark of the front center 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:20.380
 The line is straight to the point and it is difficult to cut the tip when inserting the scissors, so the tip is rounded as shown on the right. By doing so, you can insert the scissors to the last minute 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:30.800
 Overlap with the best (fuselage) and make the tables inside at that time 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:57.240
 Please align the shoulder seams and hold the pins 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:15.740
 Please match the marks on the back 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:27.300
 Please match the previous mark 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.700
 Align the mark and put the pin 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.260
 Please sew the sewing cost of Eri 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.120
 Remove the pin in front of the presser (the presser is a white part holding the sewing machine's cloth) 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.100
 Raise the presser frequently and change the direction of the curve. When raising the presser, be sure to raise it with a needle stuck in the cloth 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.300
 If the presser is lifted with the needle raised, the stitches will slip 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.180
 Make sure to sew the shoulder seam open and check that the back side is also open. 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:58.380
 Please be sure to sew around the tip
