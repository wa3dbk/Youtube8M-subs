 cardiovascular disease in general 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.960
 work mainly muscles 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.740
 lower legs in the region of the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.890
 hip 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.440
 we're not going to have big mass gains 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.310
 muscle in this region because it is a 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.310
 aerobic exercise 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.310
 before we start pedaling we should look 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.620
 especially the size of the bicycle and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.140
 make an adjustment in the bank can take as 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.600
 reference the little bone of the hip raises 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.940
 the seat or the low squeeze is already in the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.890
 way the leg should be in the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.410
 semi-flexal if the frame number has already been 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.570
 approximate for our height from 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.400
 from the moment you set the bank to 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.650
 distance from the neighborhood to the handlebars is 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.700
 a distance approximately 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.680
 accurate is usually in stores 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.119
 specialized in bicycle indicates a 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.920
 bicycle is closer 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.200
 It is important to take care that 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.930
 neck is not too tight for 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.930
 that the shoulders a strained segment 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.320
 during the tour or even on routes 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.150
 short 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.770
 it is important to always use the equipment 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.229
 mainly the helmet 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.630
 I have had three times that the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.820
 helmet broke and I did not have 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.709
 absolutely nothing in the head and I already had 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.620
 falls for terms day d is without the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.540
 helmet were 17 points on the head 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.010
 it has to stay right in the head and the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 fairs have to stay with a certain 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.180
 pressure so that it does not fall because 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.950
 it's a fall he can get out of his head 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.739
 of gloves are extremely important 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.900
 because when the cyclist falls the first 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.480
 part of the body he supports the show 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.670
 usually it's the hands and here's a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.670
 piece of leather that resists enough in 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.010
 If I fall for the night I can 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.470
 change the lenses of this same oxi put 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.260
 a yellow lens that will highlight more 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.930
 objects in light clothing managed to 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.800
 being alone becomes easier on the engine 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.800
 city ​​identify 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.560
 I have to look at the traffic he 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.510
 have to take care of vehicles that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.370
 they pass very close to us 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.720
 he has to look at the holes he has in 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.720
 way that can cause a fall 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.900
 lu pedaling there is no pact of the body 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.660

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.200
 the joints
