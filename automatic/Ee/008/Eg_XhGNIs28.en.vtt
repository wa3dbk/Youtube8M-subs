00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
what key a song is going to be in is

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.600

sing<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:22.880> best<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:26.330> harp<00:01:26.570> comes<00:01:26.990> after

sing it best in and the harp comes after

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.960 
sing it best in and the harp comes after
it<00:01:27.560> doesn't<00:01:27.800> really<00:01:27.890> matter<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.220> me<00:01:28.340> what<00:01:28.640> what
