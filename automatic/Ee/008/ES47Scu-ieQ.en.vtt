lid<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:01.229> face<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.180> I

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
lid off my face now from what I

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.789 
lid off my face now from what I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
understand from what I went to go return

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.450 
understand from what I went to go return
that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.180 
that
and<00:02:05.580> just<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.690> money<00:02:06.840> back<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.830> the

Sonia Kashuk products and this is I'm
not<00:02:50.370> sure<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:50.580> they<00:02:50.670> make<00:02:50.820> another<00:02:51.090> foundation

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
not sure if they make another foundation

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.690 
not sure if they make another foundation
I'm<00:02:51.690> sure<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.020> they<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.200> but<00:02:53.190> this<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
I'm sure that they do but this is the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.870 
I'm sure that they do but this is the
foundation<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.180> caught<00:02:54.510> my<00:02:54.690> eye<00:02:54.800> so

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
foundation that caught my eye so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.220 
foundation that caught my eye so
basically<00:02:56.880> what<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> liked<00:02:57.450> about<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.990> not

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
basically what I liked about it is not

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.550 
basically what I liked about it is not
only<00:02:58.290> does<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.220> super<00:02:59.670> light<00:02:59.820> compact

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
only does it have a super light compact

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.660 
only does it have a super light compact
hard<00:03:01.560> bottle<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.370> not<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.550> be

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
hard bottle so it's not gonna be

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.280 
hard bottle so it's not gonna be
squished<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.540> gonna<00:03:03.660> get<00:03:03.810> punctured<00:03:04.080> by

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
squished it's not gonna get punctured by

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.290 
squished it's not gonna get punctured by
anything<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.220> has<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> pump<00:03:05.700> which<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
anything but it has a pump which I

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.330 
anything but it has a pump which I
really<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:06.930> love<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.200> love<00:03:07.770> foundations

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
really really love I love foundations

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.699 
really really love I love foundations
with<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.550> pump<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:09.930> avoid<00:03:10.320> buying

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
with the pump I will avoid buying

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.440 
with the pump I will avoid buying
foundations<00:03:11.430> if<00:03:11.580> they<00:03:11.700> don't<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.269> pump

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
foundations if they don't have the pump

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.880 
foundations if they don't have the pump
on<00:03:12.630> them<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:14.610> basically<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.720> 17<00:03:16.650> mils

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
on them and so basically this is 17 mils

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.500 
on them and so basically this is 17 mils
so<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.340> about<00:03:17.459> half<00:03:17.790> your<00:03:17.820> standard

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
so it's about half your standard

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.840 
so it's about half your standard
foundation<00:03:18.750> however<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.830> only<00:03:20.120> $10<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:22.850> like

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
foundation however is only $10 so like

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.640 
foundation however is only $10 so like
