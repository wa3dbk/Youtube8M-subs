00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.330
 at 87 thousand euros the slk 55 and the ticket 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 entry the universe amg but do not go 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.340
 especially not imagine it's a 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.439
 discounted version 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.610
 indeed in its very compact size 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.710
 only 4 m 15 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.410
 amg engineers have managed to slip 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.869
 probably at the shoehorn a v8 5 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.739
 liters 5 2 421 horses I think 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.739
 that today we will not be bored 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.700
 side style the slk 55 amg gives 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.920
 the impression of overwhelmed from all over 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.660
 load front part breakthrough dwi of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.060
 ventilation and two double outputs 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.580
 Manly exhaust the wolf seriously 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.350
 of the Mercedes Roadster and to lift any 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.170
 equivocal about the pedigree of the machine 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.540
 the front wings is adorned with a if the v8 amg 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.550
 in the cockpit we note immediately 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.150
 the new dual- flat flywheel and the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.290
 amg branded seats but the slk 55 is 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.240
 also distinguishes by his 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.280
 specific instrumentation and its 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.410
 metal pallets driving equipment 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.150
 is rather complete but it will have to pass 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.130
 by the options to afford the detail 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.930
 who kills the glass roof that can 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.990
 darken by simply pressing a 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.990
 button 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.360
 but if we are on the circuit of the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.790
 fertÃ©-gaucher is to see what 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.500
 this mercedes is capable without surprises 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.600
 the performances are pretty 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.159
 even though this atmospheric v8 does not have the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.500
 iron grip of the supercharged version 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.270
 we also regret some 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 slowness of the box who balk 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.899
 sometimes to downgrade 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.340
 fortunately all this is quickly forgotten 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.310
 you discover the character 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.289
 player of this muscular roadster over 400 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.149
 horses a wheelbase runs a circuit 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.770
 rather slippery a priori this is the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.020
 ideal recipe for its a bowl and 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.090
 yet the slk 55 amg reveals it 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.009
 surprisingly considerate it's true its v8 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.840
 authorizes ample drift but the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.010
 chassis phone well the reactions 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.989
 so we can take a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 from hell the ease with which 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.130
 the slk 55 amg is left domestic and 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.000
 that we have right away 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.500
 trust 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.660
 every corner the mercedes roadster 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 encourages driving through the doors 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.970
 a real happiness with great potential 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.970
 addictive 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.140
 the slk 55 amg on the circuit this is the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.610
 bomb 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.680
 but on the road it's not bad either 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.060
 the v8 is velvet paw it is even 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.650
 able to turn on only four 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.430
 cylinders the box is of a soft 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.620
 extreme 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.150
 only small complaint with this model 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.280
 equipped with the amg performance pack 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.660
 subsidies are a bit your farm he 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.250
 very playful on circuit but 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.020
 comfortable enough to consider 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.620
 long journeys with serenity 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.060
 the slk 55 amg offers versatility 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.840
 unexpected on a roadster a priori 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.330
 exclusive 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.430
 his biggest fault, however, remains his 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.430
 high price compared to the competition
