speed and I think that's going to pose
him<00:02:41.750> some<00:02:42.050> problems<00:02:42.700> against<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.230> boxers

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
him some problems against the boxers

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.320 
him some problems against the boxers
like<00:02:45.530> legit<00:02:45.890> boxers<00:02:46.370> when<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.030> him<00:02:47.060> out

there<00:02:47.360> it's<00:02:48.230> got<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.410> good<00:02:48.620> chin<00:02:48.920> he's<00:02:49.250> got

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
there it's got a good chin he's got

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.230 
there it's got a good chin he's got

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.490 
he relies on his natural abilities more
than<00:05:18.750> actual<00:05:19.320> defense<00:05:19.890> and<00:05:20.960> he<00:05:21.960> gets<00:05:22.200> thrown

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
than actual defense and he gets thrown

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.010

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
this is you know I'm just because she

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.060 
this is you know I'm just because she
had<00:06:47.930> to<00:06:47.960> jab<00:06:48.380> all<00:06:48.590> day<00:06:48.770> long<00:06:49.180> okay<00:06:50.180> so<00:06:50.990> has<00:06:51.800> he

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
had to jab all day long okay so has he

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.830 
had to jab all day long okay so has he
learned<00:06:52.280> from<00:06:52.520> the<00:06:52.760> Ortiz<00:06:53.060> fight<00:06:53.360> and<00:06:53.600> that's

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
learned from the Ortiz fight and that's

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.450 
learned from the Ortiz fight and that's
the<00:06:54.080> biggest<00:06:54.410> thing<00:06:54.620> i<00:06:54.889> think<00:06:54.919> we're<00:06:55.280> going<00:06:55.310> to

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
the biggest thing i think we're going to

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.820 
the biggest thing i think we're going to
look<00:06:55.610> for<00:06:55.669> in<00:06:56.150> this<00:06:56.450> is<00:06:56.690> did<00:06:57.169> he<00:06:57.260> learn<00:06:57.380> if<00:06:57.620> he

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
look for in this is did he learn if he

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.460 
look for in this is did he learn if he
did<00:06:58.389> then<00:06:59.389> the<00:06:59.540> prediction<00:06:59.960> is<00:07:00.080> going<00:07:00.230> to<00:07:00.320> go

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
did then the prediction is going to go

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.730 
did then the prediction is going to go
down<00:07:00.880> svet<00:07:01.880> took<00:07:02.270> took<00:07:03.230> a<00:07:03.350> pretty<00:07:03.620> nasty

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
down svet took took a pretty nasty

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.940 
down svet took took a pretty nasty
beating<00:07:04.430> in<00:07:04.810> in<00:07:05.810> the<00:07:05.930> fight<00:07:06.139> if<00:07:06.410> he<00:07:06.590> didn't

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
beating in in the fight if he didn't

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.950 
beating in in the fight if he didn't
it's<00:07:07.160> going<00:07:07.340> to<00:07:07.400> be<00:07:07.490> a<00:07:07.520> close<00:07:07.790> fight<00:07:08.030> I<00:07:08.330> still

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
it's going to be a close fight I still

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.610 
it's going to be a close fight I still
say<00:07:09.139> it<00:07:09.290> goes<00:07:09.440> to<00:07:09.620> Berto<00:07:10.180> in<00:07:11.180> it<00:07:11.360> so<00:07:12.080> ultimately

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
say it goes to Berto in it so ultimately

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.159 
say it goes to Berto in it so ultimately
I<00:07:13.130> have<00:07:13.639> Andre<00:07:13.970> Berto<00:07:14.180> winning<00:07:14.750> this<00:07:14.900> fight<00:07:15.110> I

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:15.169 
I have Andre Berto winning this fight I

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.940 
I have Andre Berto winning this fight I
think<00:07:15.590> he<00:07:15.740> will<00:07:15.919> learn<00:07:16.100> from<00:07:16.460> the<00:07:17.710> Ortiz<00:07:18.710> fight

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950 
think he will learn from the Ortiz fight

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.890 
think he will learn from the Ortiz fight
and<00:07:19.190> he's<00:07:19.280> young<00:07:19.520> enough<00:07:19.550> that<00:07:20.030> this<00:07:20.600> war

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
and he's young enough that this war

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.190 
and he's young enough that this war
won't<00:07:21.229> be<00:07:21.680> is<00:07:21.830> undoing<00:07:22.220> but<00:07:23.210> you<00:07:23.630> know<00:07:23.750> one<00:07:24.080> or

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
won't be is undoing but you know one or

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.290 
won't be is undoing but you know one or
two<00:07:24.350> more<00:07:24.530> of<00:07:24.680> those<00:07:24.770> down<00:07:25.160> the<00:07:25.340> line<00:07:25.520> and<00:07:25.910> it's

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300 
two more of those down the line and it's

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.670 
two more of those down the line and it's
going<00:07:26.419> to<00:07:26.479> be<00:07:26.600> an<00:07:26.690> early<00:07:26.900> retirement<00:07:27.139> kind<00:07:27.560> of

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
going to be an early retirement kind of

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.690 
going to be an early retirement kind of
thing<00:07:27.830> so<00:07:29.380> he's<00:07:30.380> got<00:07:30.620> the<00:07:30.770> guts<00:07:30.950> he's<00:07:31.340> got<00:07:31.550> the

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:31.700 
thing so he's got the guts he's got the

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.180 
thing so he's got the guts he's got the
will<00:07:31.880> he's<00:07:32.120> got<00:07:32.150> the<00:07:32.450> ability<00:07:32.540> I<00:07:32.900> think<00:07:33.320> Berto

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
will he's got the ability I think Berto

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.450 
will he's got the ability I think Berto
is<00:07:34.370> going<00:07:34.520> to<00:07:34.580> pull<00:07:34.760> this<00:07:34.790> one<00:07:35.000> out<00:07:35.150> and<00:07:36.460> he'll

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
is going to pull this one out and he'll

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.560 
is going to pull this one out and he'll
be<00:07:37.669> the<00:07:37.880> IBF<00:07:38.360> champion<00:07:38.840> and<00:07:39.970> I<00:07:40.970> might<00:07:41.240> even<00:07:41.360> go

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:41.570 
be the IBF champion and I might even go

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.940 
be the IBF champion and I might even go
as<00:07:41.660> far<00:07:41.690> to<00:07:41.870> say<00:07:42.020> they'll<00:07:42.289> stop<00:07:42.590> the<00:07:42.740> fight

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950 
as far to say they'll stop the fight

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.740 
as far to say they'll stop the fight
because<00:07:43.280> avec<00:07:43.729> will<00:07:43.970> have<00:07:44.150> taken<00:07:44.510> too<00:07:44.660> many

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750 
because avec will have taken too many

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.219 
because avec will have taken too many
shots<00:07:45.310> and<00:07:46.310> go<00:07:46.430> to<00:07:46.490> the<00:07:46.580> 10th<00:07:46.820> round<00:07:47.000> okay<00:07:47.570> okay
