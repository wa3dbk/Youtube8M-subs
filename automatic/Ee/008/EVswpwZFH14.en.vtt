 Friday the price eudora harnessed 7 to 10 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.910
 years of 1700 m we are lucky in this 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 moment if it is very very beautiful lots to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.480
 vincennes at night it's a test 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.949
 of quality they are only 14 would 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.720
 that we can simply regret his 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.130
 maintenance and an interesting test 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.660
 and I think we really have basic 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.500
 reinforced concrete eh ben we will listen to your 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.960
 bass right away with your 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.910
 selection alexandra then the 5 universal 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.980
 rider leucate rosy and claws 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 leucate the vida loca 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.989
 we know the site the sea of oca les 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.719
 fourteen speedy horse the 3rd inning the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.300
 nine that goes from the fret the 12 a 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.460
 light and the 7 3 m eur we will attack 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 directly with your favorite enough 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 logically the number 5 universal riders 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.350
 which remains on a very nice series of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.969
 two wins two accessits one 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 victory at this level city in the price 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.449
 of arras déferrée of the four bases 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.619
 must-haves of the base race 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.180
 is a horse that has 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.229
 always been estimated by the way 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 career I remember it's summer 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.960
 the note in a case term of three years 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.729
 then he had known a little 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.990
 crossing of desire is there since his 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.670
 coach the barefooted four feet 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 it's really incredible were 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.299
 four times 2nd of 4 3 wins a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.799
 honorary accessit a walking horse 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.460
 very much to all the trips I think that 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.659
 in this event 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.250
 they go the trend a horse that goes 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.720
 in front of him will take head and rope 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.009
 nobody will attack him because they 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 know they will burn themselves a bit 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.479
 wings and to my friend in my opinion the ranks 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 post he's going to make us his cicor he's going 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.729
 we do a psychosis except that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 Europe needs to go far 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.549
 because I think they 're not going too much 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.340
 fussed okay let's see what we 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.630
 think mathieu mottier since arnaud 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.460
 lecomte was to meet him we 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.210
 talk about this number 5 universal riders on 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.350
 listens to them very well as 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.080
 all performance manners are 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.010
 very good 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.570
 at first that in the big pool 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.340
 should be even better this is true 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.900
 shock for that there are oppositions 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.100
 some foreigners but we have a 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.180
 feeling that needs nobody and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.020
 that he was going again a first 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 chance to defend you agree 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.830
 but I normally think if there is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.780
 happens nothing if they put in informs that 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.390
 since this winter he has a very first 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.580
 luck and he needs people on the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.600
 more daring to take the head tells nothing 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.310
 is confidence there is not much 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.840
 thing to add no but as said 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.340
 mathieu the hardest will be to take the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.570
 head but I think that even given 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.100
 that they will leave it to him easily 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.240
 the lorrains no model hawk is 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.940
 wanted to oppose 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.650
 however the number 4 osiris claw that 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.930
 just returned to success it was 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.010
 on the marseille-borély racecourse 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.380
 also confirmed vincennes as 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.850
 attest it is our race reference 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.590
 it was in the price say h the 22 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.000
 last January in vincennes 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.740
 we see he is in the lead he is going to be 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.090
 tight the moment here and b in front and 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.600
 wicked to the end he resisted to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.490
 all assaults 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.080
 yeah but it's that day that's the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.160
 horse and took the lead quickly she 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.050
 had taken the head off and we 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.670
 sees he finishes a little worse than 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.200
 Baht used to be the standard offering 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.340
 emanates who is carrier but it is a 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.240
 choice you have to know they prefer 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.610
 come from behind 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.950
 so here we can say here is the video is 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.060
 good without being exceptional now 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.050
 here I can tell you that when he 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.310
 does the last mile he goes 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.660
 significantly faster to finish so 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.250
 okay then especially that there normally 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.420
 they will have back to finish and laurens 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.070
 of water 1 it is safe and can be 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.410
 interesting so basic pretty solid 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.209
 in 3rd position of number 6 la vida 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.070
 loca who has class at the classic level 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.540
 it was in italy it's his third 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.340
 exit in France only it will be 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.320
 associated for the first time at jmb on 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.140
 is wary 5 art largely on the 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.910
 rising 13.9 13.5 on the long 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.830
 course of the great track of vincennes 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.140
 now for sure I would have it 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.910
 favorite on the test without rolling the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.440
 demi is a mare who really 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.730
 a lot of speed she will follow all 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.470
 the trains so I think jean michel 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.269
 Bazire will try to take the rope 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.620
 maybe the back of a universal rider 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.850
 she's going she'll follow him anyway 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.739
 she can walk twelve hypermarkets 13 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.110
 afterwards to finish I do not think she'll 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.650
 to be doubled yes but she will do 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.510
 the arrival 1 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.280
 it's really an interesting mare 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.620
 I think we'll trust you 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.269
 the quator speedy gold what's left on a 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.549
 convincing third place was in the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.170
 gnt to laval the horse is also 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.220
 confirmed to vincennes déferré of 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.690
 posterior we are wary of it for 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.190
 small place we are wary of it is a 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.970
 horse who had a lot of trouble from 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.830
 health so like a lot 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.050
 two horses like him they find themselves 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.180
 well with the arrival of the beautiful days he has 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.770
 less badly necessarily his performance in 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.380
 the gnt in laval was still very 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.820
 very good he's helping him go north 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.710
 of godrel or others so it's not 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.000
 anything commitment is ideal in 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.320
 back on the big track no 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.520
 problem and separated it's a horse that 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.140
 markdown that will be able to be placed 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.220
 quickly but I think this element 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.290
 is really to be taken into account in 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.000
 this test we still have the basics 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.570
 pretty solid to the paper the number three 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.550
 a brunch 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.540
 even though he has already won on the big 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.130
 vincennes track for me it's a 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.200
 horse that transcends a small 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.440
 little in the province now its form is 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.630
 safe 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.550
 there too we are wary of it, it's true 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.020
 that the little flat with him actually 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.030
 it's not necessarily Vincennes where the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.650
 big track it's the starting up 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.180
 a horse that has a lot of action and who 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.070
 parents show buries a little bit of 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.830
 time so that's why he has 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.060
 stats a little bit weak we could 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.330
 say before the shot now it's 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.560
 really in great shape it was one of 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.180
 beautiful languages ​​including the race of 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.470
 reference with the universal market rider 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.450
 13 break on the two minutes of the break. 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.250
 the small track 2007 big track he has 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.720
 already trotted 14 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.550
 I will then have to go a 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.380
 little faster this time but I 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.820
 still favors the form rather 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.230
 that there are some horses that have 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.400
 little doubts one that I put more 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.630
 down in my agreement program but 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.730
 finally we were still for the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.780
 complicated victory not of course then 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.640
 for the victory I think there is 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.740
 that two choices for me so I no 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.100
 this is it for the 3rd and 5th 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.080
 seats 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.240
 okay for a little bit too 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.950
 this is our second info field on the 12th 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.570
 August vignettes arnaud lecomte has been to 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.010
 against mathieu abrivard who we 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.240
 is talking about the chances of this number 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.940
 12 a vineyard listening to this symbol 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.230
 commitment I went not bad he goes 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.090
 to arrive with them 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.760
 a little space between his last race 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.930
 so I had a little glitch at work 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.250
 I had to take a little 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.800
 foot since it's going pretty well now 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.000
 it may miss some rice so at 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.510
 work I really feel like coming back in 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.570
 Good shape 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.430
 so you have to see but I have to 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.690
 downs a little bit the strong ones because if 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.690
 I'm doing too much I'm going to miss a little 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.510
 So few of pace is a place 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.680
 feasible 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.320
 we have understood a little doubt 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.000
 now if there is the bordeaux with a 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.770
 good end of race one part is a 4 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.030
 5th place why not for the win 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.170
 the easel paprec me there being 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.360
 given that it performs like a small 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.370
 back home now we can it's true 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.690
 this great track a bit less well 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.070
 also so match I think he's going 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.500
 wait for one of the pack try to do 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.670
 finish and then like others like 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.920
 others he has a chance for places 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.970
 good ok alexandre thanks for all 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.070
 these info before leaving 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.030
 a little nugget in the meeting yeah 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.340
 I may be doing a little bit 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.900
 invention with the 616 grove clans 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.130
 it's a filly that I liked 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.900
 several times at a trot 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.820
 this time the start under the saddle she has 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.050
 really the model for that and I think 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.850
 it can display a rating 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.350
