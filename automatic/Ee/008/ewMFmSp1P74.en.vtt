00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 the foundry then wants to open an analog 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.930
 mcdonalds our country i heard how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.769
 do you think it is good or bad there it is 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.010
 That's great because it's time 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.740
 promote our kitchen and food he 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.080
 asks for it billion it yes that's it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.670
 of course whether the state should kill it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.440
 he must do it the state itself 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.420
 maximum can help him 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.850
 tax leave or something else 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.900
 like that i don't know i was thinking about 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.460
 this three weeks ago I would have liked 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.500
 such an idea seems to me 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 support these numbers spend lying 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 domestic producers in the second in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.600
 Russia is too much 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.250
 other culture western borrowed from 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.649
 billions son for an event like you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.110
 consider it worth the money yes yes it is quite 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 because russian song is an interesting goal 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.019
 which can be spent 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.909
 but to open something more 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.350
 profitable is it worth the way there 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.659
 This billion rubles there is no why I in thought 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.940
 because recently this could us 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.890
 opened and a whole lot of people go i 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.960
 I think you should not close it Nikita 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.880
 Mikhalkov is going to open the power network 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.850
 similar to mcdonalds across the country 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.659
 We will have a meeting to be 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.009
 making money he asks and because 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.440
 that is, always wanted to talk just 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.180
 to sponsor such seems without Nikita 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.670
 Mikhalkov is engaged in cinema means let him 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.759
 engaged in cinema 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 we run for everything he asks for it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.970
 billion rubles would like to become even 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.140
 okay this will benefit nikita 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 Mikhalkov is going to open 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.850
 alternative network hop fast food 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.380
 but with Russian food this August 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:01.380
 worth it no no worth 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.850
 why I do not know but because well, that's it 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.380
 asks Putin for a billion rubles like you 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.750
 think whether it is worth it whether you should 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.479
 we do not have no, I do not think that I do not 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.849
 worth why 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.890
 people want themselves such a will open but 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.640
 my attitude to this is a priori 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.159
 negative 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.900
 because i don't understand how 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.870
 Mikhalkov-konchalovsky going 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.299
 to be with mcdonalds and especially 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.980
 come in like here on Wednesday where 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.410
 the competitors are the same 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.150
 teremok and there any such garbage here and 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.959
 it seems to me that Mikhalkov 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.269
 he is like a person who takes something 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.980
 money from the budget on the set of films he 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.920
 will definitely try to take money from 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.420
 budget for opening a tournament part of your 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 here and it will cost us all a pretty penny 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.760
 in principle, against billion Putin 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.620
 billion here well why would you and me 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.780
 not ask billions of Putin she can 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.090
 also I will not know you want me well, Che More 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.560
 money probably earn the closer he is 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.000
 asks miles from on this way on to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.260
 read the portal all states 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.959
 support such projects and why 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.879
 I think not but if the movie 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.030
 grounded there is some kind of business there 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.319
 the state is a private business that we are with 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.049
 states will be some kind of on 1 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.640
 I think the percentage of play is also probably me 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.299
 not so often bangladesh will say there myself 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.299
 I can calmly video so no problem
