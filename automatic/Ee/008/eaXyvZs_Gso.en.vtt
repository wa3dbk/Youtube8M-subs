00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
drill ok so obviously the reason we use

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
drill ok so obviously the reason we use
recruit<00:01:22.500> bots<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.100> don't<00:01:23.250> kill<00:01:23.549> us

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
recruit bots is so they don't kill us

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.070 
recruit bots is so they don't kill us
over<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.090> over<00:01:24.180> again<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.900> want

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.109 
over and over again and you just want
them<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.380> target<00:01:25.740> practice<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.790> reason<00:01:27.030> we

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
them to be target practice the reason we

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.030 
them to be target practice the reason we
use<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> ACOG<00:01:27.659> site<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.229> has<00:01:28.320> no<00:01:28.560> margin

the<00:03:09.370> gameplay<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.760> think<00:03:09.939> I<00:03:09.970> do<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> couple

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
the gameplay I think I do this a couple

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.440 
the gameplay I think I do this a couple
times<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:12.280> was<00:03:12.370> my<00:03:12.489> first<00:03:12.639> game<00:03:12.909> back<00:03:13.150> on

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450

advanced<00:03:13.720> warfare<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.290> awhile<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:14.919> it<00:03:15.250> was

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
advanced warfare in awhile and it was
