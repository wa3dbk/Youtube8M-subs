00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
when I first found out about this kind

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.770 
when I first found out about this kind
of<00:01:56.210> gun<00:01:56.479> or<00:01:56.780> yeah<00:01:57.319> like<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> romantic<00:01:57.799> comedy

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
of gun or yeah like a romantic comedy

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.550 
of gun or yeah like a romantic comedy
it's<00:01:59.780> pretty<00:01:59.990> awesome

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's pretty awesome

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.319 
it's pretty awesome
one<00:02:01.189> people<00:02:01.460> use<00:02:01.579> their<00:02:01.759> fingers<00:02:02.119> right

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
one people use their fingers right

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.160 
one people use their fingers right
what's<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.569> easier<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:05.990> use

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
what's this this is easier to use

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.800 
what's this this is easier to use
because<00:02:06.700> when<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.850> release<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.390> rubber<00:02:08.479> band

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
because when you release the rubber band

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.490 
because when you release the rubber band
it<00:02:09.440> won't<00:02:09.619> get<00:02:09.769> stuck<00:02:09.830> hit<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.780> if<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.410> were

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
it won't get stuck hit like if you were

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.050 
it won't get stuck hit like if you were
to<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.860> on<00:02:12.950> your<00:02:13.069> finger<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.580> would

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
to have it on your finger you would

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.640 
to have it on your finger you would
usually<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.510> your<00:02:14.599> finger<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.470> rubber

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
usually get your finger and the rubber

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.750 
usually get your finger and the rubber
band<00:02:15.799> would<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:15.980> somewhere<00:02:16.400> else<00:02:16.489> that<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
band would go somewhere else that you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.309 
band would go somewhere else that you
didn't<00:02:16.910> want<00:02:17.030> us<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.180> go<00:02:17.299> but<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:17.959> has<00:02:18.170> more

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
didn't want us to go but this has more

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.990 
didn't want us to go but this has more
precision<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:19.069> guess<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.430> could<00:02:19.549> say

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
precision I guess you could say

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.460 
precision I guess you could say
and<00:02:23.630> gonna<00:02:24.630> load<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:27.360> weapon<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.960> guess<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
and gonna load the weapon I guess a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.600 
and gonna load the weapon I guess a
weapon<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.010> guess<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.250> could<00:02:29.370> say<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
weapon I guess you could say it's a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.550 
weapon I guess you could say it's a
puppet<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.690> could<00:02:30.840> load<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.110> weapon<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
puppet you could load the weapon with a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
puppet you could load the weapon with a
rubber<00:02:31.770> bands<00:02:31.980> either<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.580> back<00:02:32.760> hole<00:02:33.240> or
