to<00:02:08.789> electronics<00:02:09.590> typically<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.739> have

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to electronics typically I would have

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.600 
to electronics typically I would have
soldered<00:02:11.220> these

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
soldered these

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.160 
soldered these
and<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.940> would<00:02:13.150> have<00:02:13.240> used<00:02:13.450> heat<00:02:13.780> shrink<00:02:14.050> on

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
and I would have used heat shrink on

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.860 
and I would have used heat shrink on
each<00:02:14.320> individual<00:02:14.800> wire<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:16.360> right<00:02:16.570> arm<00:02:16.750> is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
each individual wire but my right arm is

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.060 
each individual wire but my right arm is
just<00:02:17.020> not<00:02:17.170> going<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.350> allow<00:02:17.470> me<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.740> do<00:02:17.860> that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
just not going to allow me to do that

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.090 
just not going to allow me to do that
and<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.520> don't<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:18.820> anybody<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.180> come<00:02:19.420> with<00:02:19.600> me

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and I don't have anybody to come with me

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.040 
and I don't have anybody to come with me
what<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.130> found<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.940> someone<00:02:22.480> had<00:02:22.600> cut<00:02:22.840> all

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
what I found is that someone had cut all

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.990 
what I found is that someone had cut all
of<00:02:23.080> these<00:02:23.290> wires<00:02:23.530> probably<00:02:24.460> replace<00:02:24.820> this

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
of these wires probably replace this

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.080 
of these wires probably replace this
particular<00:02:25.510> pigtail<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.700> wires<00:02:27.850> match

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
particular pigtail all the wires match

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.520 
particular pigtail all the wires match
up<00:02:28.300> all<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.570> colors<00:02:28.810> match<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.260> there's<00:02:29.440> no

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
up all the colors match so there's no

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.590 
up all the colors match so there's no
issues<00:02:29.830> there<00:02:29.910> all<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.150> wires<00:02:31.330> have

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
issues there all the wires have

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.170 
issues there all the wires have
connections<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.340> plugs<00:02:33.460> into<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.760> ECM

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
connections so and it plugs into the ECM

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.810 
connections so and it plugs into the ECM
just<00:02:34.600> fine<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.590> what<00:02:35.740> they<00:02:35.860> had<00:02:35.980> done<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.700> they

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
just fine but what they had done is they

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.730 
just fine but what they had done is they
just<00:02:36.940> wrap<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.360> wires<00:02:37.540> together<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.140> then

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
just wrap the wires together and then

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.320 
just wrap the wires together and then
just<00:02:39.070> wrapped<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.490> bunch<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.880> electrical<00:02:40.300> tape

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
just wrapped a bunch of electrical tape

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.810 
just wrapped a bunch of electrical tape
over<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.780> which<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.620> horrible<00:02:42.250> now<00:02:42.370> i<00:02:42.400> will

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
over it which is horrible now i will

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.790 
over it which is horrible now i will
when<00:02:43.060> finished<00:02:43.450> i<00:02:43.720> will<00:02:43.930> cover<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.590> with

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
when finished i will cover this with

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.470 
when finished i will cover this with
electrical<00:02:45.280> tape<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.459> then<00:02:45.700> i<00:02:45.730> will<00:02:45.850> actually

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
electrical tape and then i will actually

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.880 
electrical tape and then i will actually
put<00:02:46.750> more<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.680> this<00:02:49.350> good<00:02:50.350> lord<00:02:50.530> i<00:02:50.620> forgot<00:02:50.860> what

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
put more of this good lord i forgot what

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.310 
put more of this good lord i forgot what
it's<00:02:51.070> called<00:02:51.630> well<00:02:52.630> somebody<00:02:53.020> can<00:02:53.170> comment

deal guys i redid it plugged it in
started<00:03:03.400> right<00:03:03.580> up<00:03:03.610> man<00:03:04.000> runs<00:03:04.600> great<00:03:04.780> thing

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
started right up man runs great thing

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
started right up man runs great thing
really<00:03:05.320> does<00:03:05.440> runs<00:03:05.830> absolutely<00:03:06.489> great<00:03:08.160> but

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
really does runs absolutely great but

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.650 
really does runs absolutely great but
the<00:03:09.280> issue<00:03:09.430> was<00:03:09.670> after<00:03:10.030> about<00:03:10.120> 10<00:03:10.330> minutes<00:03:10.510> of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
the issue was after about 10 minutes of

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.440 
the issue was after about 10 minutes of
running<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.989> died<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.560> then<00:03:12.520> if<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.970> jiggle

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
running it died and then if you jiggle

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.180 
running it died and then if you jiggle
where<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.959> computer<00:03:14.290> plugs<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.709> over<00:03:14.920> here

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
where the computer plugs in over here

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.190 
where the computer plugs in over here
plugs<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.030> like<00:03:16.180> right<00:03:16.360> here<00:03:16.570> if<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.720> jiggle

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
plugs in like right here if you jiggle

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.360 
plugs in like right here if you jiggle
on<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.739> just<00:03:17.799> get<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.220> right

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
on this and just get it in the right

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.610 
on this and just get it in the right
area<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.540> hear<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.750> relay<00:03:20.049> box<00:03:20.230> over

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
area you can hear the relay box over

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.160 
area you can hear the relay box over
here<00:03:21.000> click<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.810> hear<00:03:22.900> fuel

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
here click and you can hear fuel

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.330 
here click and you can hear fuel
pressure<00:03:23.380> come<00:03:23.620> through<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.860> rails<00:03:24.070> and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
pressure come through the rails and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.880 
pressure come through the rails and
it'll<00:03:24.820> start<00:03:25.090> right<00:03:25.239> up<00:03:25.269> again<00:03:25.630> until<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.470> ECM

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
it'll start right up again until the ECM

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.170 
it'll start right up again until the ECM
gets<00:03:27.070> hot<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.459> then<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.150> dies<00:03:28.299> again<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.500> i

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
gets hot and then it dies again so i

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.090 
gets hot and then it dies again so i
already<00:03:31.180> know<00:03:31.470> like<00:03:32.470> ninety<00:03:32.799> nine<00:03:32.950> percent

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
already know like ninety nine percent

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.220 
already know like ninety nine percent
certainty<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.480> issue<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:37.540> ECM<00:03:37.989> i

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
certainty that the issue is in the ECM i

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.250 
certainty that the issue is in the ECM i
believe<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.250> what<00:03:39.400> happened<00:03:40.140> ignore<00:03:41.140> the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
believe that what happened ignore the

believe that what happened ignore the
children<00:03:41.620> i<00:03:43.320> believe<00:03:44.320> that<00:03:44.500> what<00:03:44.620> happened<00:03:45.040> is

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
children i believe that what happened is

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.530 
children i believe that what happened is
when<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.830> people<00:03:48.090> decided<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:50.549> rig<00:03:51.549> up<00:03:51.580> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
when the people decided to rig up the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.770 
when the people decided to rig up the
wiring<00:03:53.250> they<00:03:54.250> probably<00:03:54.670> got<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> wire<00:03:55.360> or<00:03:55.390> two

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
wiring they probably got a wire or two

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.710 
wiring they probably got a wire or two
or<00:03:55.989> ten<00:03:56.260> touching<00:03:56.890> one<00:03:57.040> another<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.720> it

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
or ten touching one another and it

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.590 
or ten touching one another and it
probably<00:03:58.959> burned<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.530> trace<00:03:59.799> in<00:03:59.830> the<00:04:00.040> board

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
probably burned a trace in the board

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.910 
probably burned a trace in the board
these<00:04:01.600> computers<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:02.410> already<00:04:02.650> taken<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
computer apart this was replaced in 2012

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.220 
computer apart this was replaced in 2012
it's<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.670> Mopar<00:04:07.030> ginny<00:04:07.299> one<00:04:07.480> part<00:04:07.750> replaced<00:04:08.110> in

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
it's a Mopar ginny one part replaced in

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.090 
it's a Mopar ginny one part replaced in
2012<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:08.799> obviously<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.340> had<00:04:09.459> issues<00:04:09.730> before

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
2012 so obviously it's had issues before

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.850 
2012 so obviously it's had issues before
what<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.130> believe<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.989> right<00:04:14.230> here<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.680> where

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
what I believe and right here is where

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.560 
what I believe and right here is where
the<00:04:15.130> plug-in<00:04:15.519> that's<00:04:15.910> causing<00:04:16.299> me<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.479> issue

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
the plug-in that's causing me to issue

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.020 
the plug-in that's causing me to issue
is<00:04:16.780> took<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.440> computer<00:04:17.590> part<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.310> as<00:04:18.729> I

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
is took the computer part and as I

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.880 
is took the computer part and as I
figured<00:04:19.540> there<00:04:19.690> would<00:04:19.840> be<00:04:19.870> it's<00:04:20.260> full<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.739> this

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
figured there would be it's full of this

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.180 
figured there would be it's full of this
gel<00:04:22.110> basically<00:04:23.110> for

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
gel basically for

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.230 
gel basically for
tirana<00:04:24.400> components<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.910> are<00:04:24.970> going<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.150> be

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
tirana components that are going to be

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.770 
tirana components that are going to be
left<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:27.310> areas<00:04:27.760> that<00:04:27.790> are<00:04:28.090> sensitive<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.570> heat

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
left in areas that are sensitive to heat

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.290 
left in areas that are sensitive to heat
and<00:04:29.080> moisture<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.340> things<00:04:30.550> they<00:04:30.790> fill<00:04:31.120> this

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
and moisture and things they fill this

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.000 
and moisture and things they fill this
with<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.510> gel<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:31.840> protects<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.410> electronics

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
with a gel that protects the electronics

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.580 
with a gel that protects the electronics
there's<00:04:33.580> no<00:04:33.760> way<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:33.940> get<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.420> when<00:04:35.140> it's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
there's no way to get to it when it's

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.680 
there's no way to get to it when it's
probably<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.040> multi-layer<00:04:36.820> board<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.360> mean

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
probably a multi-layer board I mean

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.240 
probably a multi-layer board I mean
probably<00:04:37.870> at<00:04:38.230> least<00:04:38.380> three<00:04:38.770> maybe<00:04:38.950> five

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
probably at least three maybe five

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.810 
probably at least three maybe five
layers<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.910> board<00:04:40.180> PCB<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:42.520> don't<00:04:42.700> know

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
layers of board PCB and you don't know

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.250 
layers of board PCB and you don't know
which<00:04:43.060> trace<00:04:43.360> could<00:04:43.540> be<00:04:43.630> burned<00:04:43.870> but<00:04:44.080> I'm

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
which trace could be burned but I'm

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.100 
which trace could be burned but I'm
positive<00:04:45.190> we've<00:04:45.610> probably<00:04:46.060> got<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.480> hot<00:04:46.840> or

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
positive we've probably got a hot or

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.950 
positive we've probably got a hot or
ground<00:04:47.470> issue<00:04:47.740> with<00:04:48.610> one<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:48.820> these<00:04:49.000> pins<00:04:49.390> that

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
ground issue with one of these pins that

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.010 
ground issue with one of these pins that
are<00:04:50.020> soldered<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.620> board<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.750> seems

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
are soldered to the board so it seems

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.530 
are soldered to the board so it seems
that<00:04:53.110> when<00:04:53.230> it's<00:04:53.350> hot<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:54.070> dies<00:04:54.280> out<00:04:54.520> what<00:04:55.420> I'm

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
that when it's hot it dies out what I'm

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.030 
that when it's hot it dies out what I'm
doing<00:04:55.570> right<00:04:55.960> now<00:04:56.020> is<00:04:56.380> I'm<00:04:56.470> freezing<00:04:56.950> the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
doing right now is I'm freezing the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.620 
doing right now is I'm freezing the
board<00:04:57.280> I'll<00:04:57.820> leave<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.090> in<00:04:58.180> there<00:04:58.270> for<00:04:58.330> several

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
board I'll leave it in there for several

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.580 
board I'll leave it in there for several
hours<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.140> make<00:04:59.230> sure<00:04:59.260> it<00:04:59.470> gets

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
hours and make sure it gets

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.160 
hours and make sure it gets
exceptionally<00:05:00.280> cold<00:05:00.780> then<00:05:01.780> I'll<00:05:01.900> plug<00:05:02.050> it

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
exceptionally cold then I'll plug it

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.390 
exceptionally cold then I'll plug it
back<00:05:02.260> in<00:05:02.470> i'll<00:05:02.650> be<00:05:02.770> willing<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.130> bet<00:05:03.160> money

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
back in i'll be willing to bet money

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.100 
back in i'll be willing to bet money
that<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.730> truck<00:05:03.970> will<00:05:04.090> probably<00:05:04.570> run<00:05:04.780> for<00:05:04.840> a

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
that the truck will probably run for a

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.810 
that the truck will probably run for a
good<00:05:05.320> 20<00:05:05.500> 30<00:05:05.950> minutes<00:05:06.190> or<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:06.550> until<00:05:06.580> that

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
good 20 30 minutes or so until that

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.010 
good 20 30 minutes or so until that
board<00:05:07.120> warms<00:05:07.420> up<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.720> know<00:05:10.840> that's

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
board warms up and you know that's

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.240 
board warms up and you know that's
pretty<00:05:11.140> much<00:05:11.350> going<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.590> tell<00:05:11.770> me<00:05:11.890> what<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.040> need

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
pretty much going to tell me what I need

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
your new one but I think this is what

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.500 
your new one but I think this is what
I'm<00:05:56.980> going<00:05:57.100> to<00:05:57.160> go<00:05:57.250> with<00:05:57.280> once<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.150> computer

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
I'm going to go with once the computer

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.909 
I'm going to go with once the computer
is<00:05:58.570> good<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.780> frozen<00:05:59.110> I'll<00:05:59.530> take<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.830> out

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
is good and frozen I'll take it out

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.230 
is good and frozen I'll take it out
there<00:06:00.070> and<00:06:00.130> see<00:06:00.220> how<00:06:00.370> long<00:06:00.490> it'll<00:06:00.669> run<00:06:00.820> for<00:06:01.090> it

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
there and see how long it'll run for it

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.280 
there and see how long it'll run for it
if<00:06:01.300> it<00:06:01.419> runs<00:06:01.540> longer<00:06:01.980> with<00:06:02.980> the<00:06:04.290> computer

if it runs longer with the computer

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.050 
if it runs longer with the computer
frozen<00:06:05.620> then<00:06:06.130> I'll<00:06:06.490> know<00:06:06.700> that<00:06:06.940> it's

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
frozen then I'll know that it's

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.140 
frozen then I'll know that it's
definitely<00:06:07.300> an<00:06:07.690> issue<00:06:07.840> with<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.800> ECM<00:06:09.730> itself
