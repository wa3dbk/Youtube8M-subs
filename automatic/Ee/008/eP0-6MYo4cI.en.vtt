just<00:02:45.830> feel<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.310> gives<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.790> deeper

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150 
just feel that it gives it a deeper
flavor<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.800> slightly
