00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
one does that piece there a couple of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.340 
one does that piece there a couple of
them<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:56.189> um<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.840> haven't<00:01:57.840> looked<00:01:57.990> those

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
them don't but um I haven't looked those

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.910 
them don't but um I haven't looked those
up<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.799> ebay<00:01:59.520> either<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.299> I'm<00:02:00.479> assuming<00:02:00.920> for

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
up on ebay either but I'm assuming for

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.649 
up on ebay either but I'm assuming for
the<00:02:01.979> lot<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.520> five<00:02:02.759> i<00:02:02.790> could<00:02:03.210> probably<00:02:03.420> get

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the lot of all five i could probably get

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 
the lot of all five i could probably get
maybe<00:02:03.960> another<00:02:04.860> ten<00:02:05.130> bucks<00:02:05.340> maybe<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.880> little

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
maybe another ten bucks maybe a little

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.050 
maybe another ten bucks maybe a little
more<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.920> i'm<00:02:07.920> thinking<00:02:07.979> worst<00:02:08.399> case<00:02:08.640> scenario

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
more so i'm thinking worst case scenario

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.900 
more so i'm thinking worst case scenario
about<00:02:09.239> 20<00:02:09.539> bucks<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:11.160> could<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
about 20 bucks out of this or could be a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.100 
about 20 bucks out of this or could be a
little<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.239> if

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
little more if

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.230 
little more if
in<00:02:13.200> working<00:02:13.590> condition<00:02:13.710> but<00:02:14.310> either<00:02:14.700> way<00:02:15.000> I

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
in working condition but either way I

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.720 
in working condition but either way I
was<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.900> pretty<00:02:16.290> cool<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:17.370> whole<00:02:17.490> time<00:02:17.670> I

you<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.650> see<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:11.040> think<00:03:11.790> some<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.000> these<00:03:12.380> might

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
you can see I think some of these might

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.930 
you can see I think some of these might
have<00:03:13.500> been<00:03:13.680> good<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.130> sell<00:03:14.370> if<00:03:14.610> they<00:03:14.760> weren't
