millimeters<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.940> thickness<00:00:51.500> it's<00:00:52.500> thirty

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
millimeters in thickness it's thirty

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.850 
millimeters in thickness it's thirty
percent<00:00:53.250> harder<00:00:53.789> than<00:00:54.120> SPPs<00:00:55.110> existing

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
percent harder than SPPs existing

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
percent harder than SPPs existing
products<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:56.460> means<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> be

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
products which means it's going to be

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
products which means it's going to be
more<00:00:57.840> scratch<00:00:58.350> resistant<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> therefore

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
more scratch resistant and therefore

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.020 
more scratch resistant and therefore
last<00:01:00.239> longer<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.230> allows<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> ninety<00:01:02.520> three

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
last longer it allows up to ninety three

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.420 
last longer it allows up to ninety three
percent<00:01:03.199> light<00:01:04.199> transmission<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.220> should

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
percent light transmission so it should

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
percent light transmission so it should
be<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:05.700> clear<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:07.140> doesn't<00:01:07.320> affect

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
be pretty clear and it doesn't affect

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.950 
be pretty clear and it doesn't affect
the<00:01:07.890> overall<00:01:07.920> touch<00:01:08.729> sensitivity<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the overall touch sensitivity of the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.750 
the overall touch sensitivity of the
device<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.280> give<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> some

just<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.259> thick<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.909> seems<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> be

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
just how thick it is it seems to be

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.770 
just how thick it is it seems to be
about<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.159> said<00:01:53.399> two<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.820> three<00:01:54.060> times<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
about like I said two or three times the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
about like I said two or three times the
size<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> standard<00:01:55.380> screen<00:01:55.950> shield<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.460> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
size of a standard screen shield if you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
size of a standard screen shield if you
were<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.240> two<00:01:57.540> pieces<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.049> screen<00:01:58.380> shield

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
were to take two pieces of screen shield

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
were to take two pieces of screen shield
and<00:01:58.799> stack<00:01:59.070> them<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.340> top<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.610> each<00:01:59.850> other<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and stack them on top of each other it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.109 
and stack them on top of each other it
feels<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.869> rigid<00:02:01.469> almost<00:02:01.799> plasticky<00:02:02.640> which

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
feels very rigid almost plasticky which

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.240 
feels very rigid almost plasticky which
I<00:02:03.240> think<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.600> make<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> install<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I think will make it install on all that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.490 
I think will make it install on all that
easier<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.420> let<00:02:06.509> me<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.719> make<00:02:06.899> sure<00:02:06.960> my<00:02:07.259> phone

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
easier so let me just make sure my phone

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800 
easier so let me just make sure my phone
is<00:02:07.649> absolutely<00:02:08.250> clear<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> clean<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.479> free

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
is absolutely clear and clean and free

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.869 
is absolutely clear and clean and free
of<00:02:09.840> dust<00:02:10.200> before<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.099> proceed<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
of dust before I proceed with the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.710 
of dust before I proceed with the
installation<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.569> will<00:02:12.720> try<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> do<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.410> on

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
installation I will try to do this on

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.380 
installation I will try to do this on
camera<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.800> remove<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.340> backing<00:02:15.940> piece

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
camera going to remove the backing piece

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.160 
camera going to remove the backing piece
first<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:18.100> stick<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.820> on<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.690> let's<00:02:19.930> see

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
first and then stick it on so let's see

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.570 
first and then stick it on so let's see
what<00:02:20.290> happens<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:20.890> not<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.280> comfortable

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
what happens I'm not really comfortable

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.090 
what happens I'm not really comfortable
installing<00:02:22.330> these<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.660> camera<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.380> I'll<00:02:23.860> do

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
installing these on camera but I'll do

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.090 
installing these on camera but I'll do
my<00:02:24.130> best<00:02:24.310> because<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.330> rigid<00:02:25.810> I'm<00:02:26.770> able

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
my best because it's so rigid I'm able

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.880 
my best because it's so rigid I'm able
to<00:02:27.280> actually<00:02:27.750> line<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.930> up<00:02:29.020> quite<00:02:29.260> easily<00:02:29.320> even

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
to actually line it up quite easily even

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.590 
to actually line it up quite easily even
though<00:02:30.040> I'm<00:02:30.160> not<00:02:30.190> even<00:02:30.610> looking<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.510> know

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
though I'm not even looking you know

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.270 
though I'm not even looking you know
right<00:02:31.900> at<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.160> lay<00:02:33.250> it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
right at it so I'm just going to lay it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.700 
right at it so I'm just going to lay it
down<00:02:33.550> kind<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.240> screen<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.930> then<00:02:35.440> move

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
down kind of on the screen and then move

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.020 
down kind of on the screen and then move
it<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> side<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.520> make<00:02:36.730> sure<00:02:36.760> I'm

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
it to the side just to make sure I'm

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.970 
it to the side just to make sure I'm
lined<00:02:37.330> up<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.780> I'm<00:02:37.870> not<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.680> I'm<00:02:38.770> going<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
lined up and I'm not so I'm going to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.430 
lined up and I'm not so I'm going to
peel<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.430> off<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.000> I'll<00:02:40.140> probably<00:02:41.140> have<00:02:41.410> to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
peel this off and I'll probably have to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.990 
peel this off and I'll probably have to
take<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.830> off<00:02:41.980> camera<00:02:42.310> because<00:02:42.580> i'm<00:02:42.700> just<00:02:42.880> at

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
take it off camera because i'm just at

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.510 
take it off camera because i'm just at
an<00:02:43.120> awkward<00:02:43.330> angle<00:02:43.860> all<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.190> i'm<00:02:45.280> back

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
an awkward angle all right so i'm back

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.940 
an awkward angle all right so i'm back
with<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.150> finish<00:02:46.660> installation<00:02:47.110> sorry<00:02:47.770> about

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
with the finish installation sorry about

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.380 
with the finish installation sorry about
having<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.220> pull<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.580> off<00:02:48.670> camera<00:02:48.940> I'm<00:02:49.240> just

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
having to pull that off camera I'm just

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.970 
having to pull that off camera I'm just
very<00:02:49.600> particular<00:02:50.110> about<00:02:50.140> my<00:02:50.290> screen<00:02:50.709> shields

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
very particular about my screen shields

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.530 
very particular about my screen shields
and<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.130> like<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.490> get<00:02:51.580> them<00:02:51.820> right<00:02:52.030> I've

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
and I like to get them right I've

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.090 
and I like to get them right I've
developed<00:02:52.870> what<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.350> think<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.740> really<00:02:53.920> good

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
developed what I think is a really good

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.699 
developed what I think is a really good
technique<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.870> know<00:02:55.990> once<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.320> get<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.590> on

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
technique and you know once I get it on

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.740 
technique and you know once I get it on
perfect<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.220> almost<00:02:57.640> hard<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.270> tell<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.660> to

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
perfect it's almost hard to tell it to

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.940 
perfect it's almost hard to tell it to
even<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.290> that's<00:02:59.380> what<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.620> wanted<00:02:59.890> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
even on and that's what I wanted to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.290 
even on and that's what I wanted to
accomplish<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.700> that's<00:03:00.820> what<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:00.970> think<00:03:01.209> I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
accomplish and that's what I think I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.710 
accomplish and that's what I think I
accomplished<00:03:01.810> share<00:03:02.050> with<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.890> sgp

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
accomplished share with the sgp

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.120 
accomplished share with the sgp
crystal-clear<00:03:04.720> ultimate<00:03:05.290> class<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.830> took<00:03:05.890> my

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
crystal-clear ultimate class I took my

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.980 
crystal-clear ultimate class I took my
time<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.640> got<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:06.940> about<00:03:07.030> ninety-nine<00:03:07.630> point

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
time I got it about ninety-nine point

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.070 
time I got it about ninety-nine point
nine<00:03:08.140> percent<00:03:08.950> perfect<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.570> much<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:10.930> I

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
nine percent perfect so much so that I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.930 
nine percent perfect so much so that I
think<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.560> average<00:03:11.680> person<00:03:12.220> probably<00:03:12.670> could

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
think the average person probably could

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.420 
think the average person probably could
not<00:03:13.060> even<00:03:13.180> tell<00:03:13.450> there's<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.690> screen<00:03:13.959> shield<00:03:14.140> on

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
not even tell there's a screen shield on

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.740 
not even tell there's a screen shield on
I'll<00:03:15.430> bring<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.730> up<00:03:15.820> close<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.360> cameras

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
I'll bring it up close to the cameras

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.810 
I'll bring it up close to the cameras
you<00:03:16.959> can<00:03:16.990> see<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.590> how<00:03:17.739> crystal<00:03:18.310> clear<00:03:18.580> this

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
you can see just how crystal clear this

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.690 
you can see just how crystal clear this
is<00:03:19.030> let<00:03:19.660> me<00:03:19.780> turn<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.320> phone's<00:03:20.530> display<00:03:20.920> so

some<00:03:34.720> screen<00:03:35.019> shields<00:03:35.320> have<00:03:35.440> kind<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.860> weird

some screen shields have kind of a weird
texture<00:03:36.519> this<00:03:37.209> feels<00:03:37.570> as<00:03:37.900> close<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.650> the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
texture this feels as close to the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.520 
texture this feels as close to the
iphone<00:03:39.310> glass<00:03:39.760> as<00:03:40.150> any<00:03:40.390> other<00:03:40.480> screen<00:03:41.350> shield

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
I've ever tried it does seem till you

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.020 
I've ever tried it does seem till you
know<00:03:44.290> smear<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:44.980> leave<00:03:45.130> some<00:03:45.430> fingerprints

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
know smear and leave some fingerprints

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.180 
know smear and leave some fingerprints
just<00:03:46.269> like<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.510> iphones<00:03:46.870> glass<00:03:47.110> does<00:03:47.410> but<00:03:47.980> not

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
just like the iphones glass does but not

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.850 
just like the iphones glass does but not
as<00:03:48.400> much<00:03:48.700> as<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.209> naked<00:03:49.540> glass<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.650> there's

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
as much as the naked glass and there's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.710 
as much as the naked glass and there's
no<00:03:51.070> like<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.640> know<00:03:51.730> orange<00:03:52.030> peel<00:03:52.330> or<00:03:52.540> like

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
no like you know orange peel or like

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.990 
no like you know orange peel or like
tackiness<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.620> your<00:03:53.980> finger<00:03:54.400> glides<00:03:54.730> along

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
tackiness to it your finger glides along

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.870 
tackiness to it your finger glides along
it<00:03:55.330> as<00:03:55.480> if<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.840> were<00:03:55.989> glass<00:03:56.290> I'm<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.549> love<00:03:57.730> with

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
it as if it were glass I'm in love with

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.699 
it as if it were glass I'm in love with
this<00:03:57.970> product<00:03:58.420> my<00:03:58.540> only<00:03:58.690> fear<00:03:58.989> about<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.530> is

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
this product my only fear about it is

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.380 
this product my only fear about it is
it's<00:04:00.310> probably<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:00.820> going<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.000> work<00:04:01.180> with

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
it's probably not going to work with

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.890 
it's probably not going to work with
slider<00:04:01.840> style<00:04:02.140> cases<00:04:02.620> because<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:03.900> thick

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
slider style cases because it's so thick

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.930 
slider style cases because it's so thick
you<00:04:04.930> know<00:04:05.140> two<00:04:05.290> times<00:04:05.680> thicker<00:04:05.950> than<00:04:06.100> what

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
you know two times thicker than what

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.310 
you know two times thicker than what
probably<00:04:07.239> normal<00:04:07.600> screen<00:04:07.810> shell<00:04:07.989> is<00:04:08.110> maybe

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
probably normal screen shell is maybe

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.500 
probably normal screen shell is maybe
even<00:04:08.500> three<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.850> it's<00:04:10.030> probably<00:04:10.120> going<00:04:10.450> to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
even three so it's probably going to

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.780 
even three so it's probably going to
bubble<00:04:10.840> up<00:04:10.900> with<00:04:11.110> certain<00:04:11.470> cases<00:04:11.709> but<00:04:12.310> you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
bubble up with certain cases but you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.430 
bubble up with certain cases but you
know<00:04:12.880> with<00:04:13.090> select<00:04:13.660> cases<00:04:13.870> it'll<00:04:14.260> work<00:04:14.410> just

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
know with select cases it'll work just

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.610 
know with select cases it'll work just
fine<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:16.120> hard<00:04:16.330> obviously<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.080> impress<00:04:17.440> upon

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
fine it's hard obviously to impress upon

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.280 
fine it's hard obviously to impress upon
you<00:04:17.919> just<00:04:18.160> how<00:04:18.280> good<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:19.150> looks<00:04:19.209> when<00:04:20.140> you're

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
you just how good it looks when you're

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.219 
you just how good it looks when you're
on<00:04:20.410> camera<00:04:20.709> but<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.609> mean<00:04:22.090> it's<00:04:22.479> probably<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
on camera but I mean it's probably the

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.409 
on camera but I mean it's probably the
