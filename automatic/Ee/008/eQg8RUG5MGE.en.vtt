00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
compared to infinity ward but that's

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.420 
compared to infinity ward but that's
here<00:01:06.670> nor<00:01:06.820> there<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.530> I'm<00:01:08.950> just<00:01:09.130> really

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
here nor there and I'm just really

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.760 
here nor there and I'm just really
concerned<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.630> mean<00:01:11.229> I<00:01:11.320> come<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.680> the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
concerned that I mean I come to the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
concerned that I mean I come to the
conclusion<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.280> I<00:01:12.369> had<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.549> do<00:01:12.640> with<00:01:12.729> the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
conclusion that I had to do with the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.910 
conclusion that I had to do with the
killstreaks<00:01:13.330> I'm<00:01:13.540> just<00:01:14.049> really<00:01:14.350> concerned<00:01:14.530> to

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
killstreaks I'm just really concerned to

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.490 
killstreaks I'm just really concerned to
the<00:01:15.070> fact<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.060> think<00:01:16.870> these<00:01:16.990> kill<00:01:17.260> streaks

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
the fact that I think these kill streaks

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.230 
the fact that I think these kill streaks
are<00:01:17.620> getting<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.830> little<00:01:17.980> out<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.130> hand<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:19.150> I'm

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
are getting a little out of hand and I'm

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.910 
are getting a little out of hand and I'm
hoping<00:01:19.450> I'm<00:01:19.570> wrong<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:19.960> hope<00:01:20.410> modern<00:01:20.650> warfare<00:01:20.770> 3

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
hoping I'm wrong I hope modern warfare 3

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.160 
hoping I'm wrong I hope modern warfare 3
is<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.220> best<00:01:21.580> game<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:22.180> call<00:01:22.720> duty<00:01:22.900> has<00:01:23.050> ever

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
is the best game that call duty has ever

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.240 
is the best game that call duty has ever
made<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.410> really<00:01:23.800> do<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:26.620> simplicity<00:01:27.220> of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
made I really do but the simplicity of

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.760 
made I really do but the simplicity of
call<00:01:27.640> duty<00:01:27.790> 4<00:01:28.120> and<00:01:28.390> world<00:01:28.570> at<00:01:28.720> war<00:01:28.900> I<00:01:29.170> think

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
call duty 4 and world at war I think

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.370 
call duty 4 and world at war I think
makes<00:01:30.300> makes<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.480> game<00:01:31.630> so<00:01:31.960> much<00:01:32.170> more

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
makes makes the game so much more

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.250 
makes makes the game so much more
enjoyable<00:01:32.620> than<00:01:32.860> maybe<00:01:33.010> we'll<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:34.260> modern

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
enjoyable than maybe we'll the modern

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.840 
enjoyable than maybe we'll the modern
warfare<00:01:35.320> 3<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.890> black<00:01:36.040> ops<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.430> love<00:01:36.670> black

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
warfare 3 and black ops and I love black

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.780 
warfare 3 and black ops and I love black
ops<00:01:37.120> it's<00:01:37.330> probably<00:01:37.930> my<00:01:38.110> favorite<00:01:38.470> game<00:01:38.790> but

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
ops it's probably my favorite game but

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.700 
ops it's probably my favorite game but
it's<00:01:40.480> either<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.780> world<00:01:40.990> world<00:01:41.380> at<00:01:41.530> war

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
it's either that a world world at war

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.680 
it's either that a world world at war
but<00:01:42.720> black<00:01:43.720> ops<00:01:43.960> has<00:01:44.140> definitely<00:01:44.500> produced

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
but black ops has definitely produced

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.410 
but black ops has definitely produced
the<00:01:46.690> most<00:01:46.840> rage<00:01:47.650> out<00:01:47.980> of<00:01:48.130> any<00:01:48.280> call<00:01:49.060> duty<00:01:49.210> game

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
the most rage out of any call duty game

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.600 
the most rage out of any call duty game
to<00:01:49.510> date<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.960> think<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.040> has<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.159> lot<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.430> do

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
to date I think that has a lot to do

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.399 
to date I think that has a lot to do
with<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.730> killstreaks<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.420> mean<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.200> could<00:01:53.290> be

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
with the killstreaks I mean it could be

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.230 
with the killstreaks I mean it could be
a<00:01:53.440> bunch<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:54.280> other<00:01:54.490> things<00:01:54.790> people<00:01:55.060> saying

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
a bunch of other things people saying

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.730 
a bunch of other things people saying
all<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.450> fact<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.690> they're<00:01:55.840> displaying<00:01:56.200> you

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
all the fact that they're displaying you

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.020 
all the fact that they're displaying you
know<00:01:56.800> showing<00:01:57.130> stats<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.700> there<00:01:57.790> when

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
know showing stats and there when

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.880 
know showing stats and there when
heavily<00:01:58.390> on<00:01:58.479> stats<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:58.930> another<00:01:59.560> reason<00:01:59.740> why

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
heavily on stats is another reason why

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950 
heavily on stats is another reason why
people<00:02:00.040> rage<00:02:00.310> quit<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.850> freak<00:02:01.360> out<00:02:01.510> just<00:02:01.570> any

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
people rage quit and freak out just any

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.390 
people rage quit and freak out just any
other<00:02:02.020> thing<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.680> really<00:02:03.010> think<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.250> has<00:02:03.370> to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
other thing but I really think it has to

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.310 
other thing but I really think it has to
do<00:02:03.640> with<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.970> killstreaks<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.659> mean<00:02:04.810> put<00:02:05.260> it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
do with the killstreaks I mean put it

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.510 
do with the killstreaks I mean put it
this<00:02:05.380> way<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.560> going<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.770> join<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.950> black<00:02:06.310> ops

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
this way you going to join a black ops

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.219 
this way you going to join a black ops
game<00:02:06.610> late<00:02:06.880> which<00:02:07.000> we<00:02:07.150> all<00:02:07.270> know<00:02:07.299> happens<00:02:07.990> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
game late which we all know happens and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.410 
game late which we all know happens and
sucks<00:02:08.560> ass<00:02:08.769> when<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.039> does<00:02:09.280> but<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.239> join

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
sucks ass when it does but when you join

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.520 
sucks ass when it does but when you join
a<00:02:10.450> black<00:02:10.629> ops<00:02:10.810> game<00:02:10.899> late<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.349> there's<00:02:11.470> a
