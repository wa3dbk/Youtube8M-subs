00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:12.590

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.890
 absurdity

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.940

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.920
 said the creator of a flying nanny 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.810
 with a carrying umbrella that saved the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.690
 children believe that Mary poppins came to 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.850
 save children for sir 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.890
 miss traver is that it escapes me 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.440

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.140
 Mary Poppins and the banks are my family 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.140
 Mary Poppins really existed 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.350
 so he did not come to save the children 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.510

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.180

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.390
 Once a person enters a cinema 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.460
 will enjoy 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.460
 is that he does not want to finish the story 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.870
