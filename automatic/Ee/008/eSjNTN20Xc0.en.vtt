00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
think that it's designed well and i said

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.580 
think that it's designed well and i said
in<00:03:04.079> my<00:03:04.109> other<00:03:04.290> video<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:05.519> if<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:07.379> have

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
in my other video that if you don't have

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.650 
in my other video that if you don't have
a<00:03:07.620> lot<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.769> funds<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:08.849> spyderco<00:03:09.450> knives

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
a lot of funds you like spyderco knives

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.449 
a lot of funds you like spyderco knives
i<00:03:10.049> think<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> great<00:03:10.769> way<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.069> get<00:03:11.310> into

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
i think this is a great way to get into

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.490 
i think this is a great way to get into
one<00:03:11.879> because<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.329> is<00:03:12.390> around<00:03:12.900> thirty-five

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
one because this is around thirty-five

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.759 
one because this is around thirty-five
thirty-six<00:03:13.769> dollars<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.260> whole<00:03:16.560> lot

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
thirty-six dollars and it's a whole lot

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.400 
thirty-six dollars and it's a whole lot
more<00:03:17.090> sexy<00:03:18.090> you're<00:03:18.269> appealing<00:03:18.599> than<00:03:18.989> carrying

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
more sexy you're appealing than carrying

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.909 
more sexy you're appealing than carrying
around<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:20.239> Swiss<00:03:21.239> Army<00:03:21.419> knife<00:03:21.810> not<00:03:22.769> that

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
around a Swiss Army knife not that

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.500 
around a Swiss Army knife not that
there's<00:03:23.130> anything<00:03:23.280> wrong<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.579> those<00:03:24.030> that

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
there's anything wrong with those that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.199 
there's anything wrong with those that
just<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.930> be<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.079> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.410> more<00:03:25.590> blocky

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
just can be a little bit more blocky

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.680 
just can be a little bit more blocky
little<00:03:27.209> thicker<00:03:28.250> etc<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.790> think<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.480> just

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
little thicker etc so I think this just

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.440 
little thicker etc so I think this just
has<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> little<00:03:31.019> bit<00:03:31.200> more<00:03:31.349> of<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.500> cool<00:03:31.709> factor

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
has a little bit more of a cool factor

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.970 
has a little bit more of a cool factor
again<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.660> non<00:03:33.840> locking<00:03:34.079> blade<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:34.829> you

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
again it's a non locking blade if you

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.559 
again it's a non locking blade if you
haven't<00:03:35.340> checked<00:03:35.609> out<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.910> other<00:03:35.970> video<00:03:36.329> but

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
haven't checked out the other video but

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.830 
haven't checked out the other video but
you<00:03:36.660> can<00:03:36.739> open<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.859> single<00:03:38.280> Hanley<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.690> can

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
you can open it single Hanley you can

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.870 
you can open it single Hanley you can
close<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.290> with<00:03:40.410> one<00:03:40.590> hand<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.950> well<00:03:41.160> blade

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
close it with one hand as well blade

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.120 
close it with one hand as well blade
doesn't<00:03:42.090> block<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.500> pretty<00:03:43.919> well

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
doesn't block but it is pretty well

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.030 
doesn't block but it is pretty well
sturdy<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:47.989> one<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.139> reasons<00:03:49.200> or<00:03:49.889> ways

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
sturdy and one of the reasons or ways

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.099 
sturdy and one of the reasons or ways
they<00:03:50.400> keep<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.730> price<00:03:50.970> lower<00:03:51.329> is<00:03:51.660> they're<00:03:51.900> not

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
they keep the price lower is they're not

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.089 
they keep the price lower is they're not
using<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:53.190> highest<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.209> quality<00:03:54.359> steals<00:03:55.099> and

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
using the highest of quality steals and

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.970 
using the highest of quality steals and
of<00:03:56.340> course<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.819> FRN<00:03:57.450> or<00:03:57.629> what<00:03:58.349> i'll<00:03:58.470> call<00:03:58.500> just

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
of course the FRN or what i'll call just

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.420 
of course the FRN or what i'll call just
plastic<00:03:59.609> handle<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:01.260> how<00:04:01.650> they<00:04:01.829> lower<00:04:02.040> costs

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
plastic handle is how they lower costs

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.319 
plastic handle is how they lower costs
and<00:04:03.769> when<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.799> say<00:04:05.040> lower<00:04:05.250> quality<00:04:05.700> steals<00:04:06.000> I

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
and when I say lower quality steals I

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.159 
and when I say lower quality steals I
have<00:04:06.540> used<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.900> on<00:04:07.109> boxes<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:09.569> know<00:04:09.690> top

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
have used this on boxes and you know top

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.569 
have used this on boxes and you know top
of<00:04:10.319> wine<00:04:10.500> bottles<00:04:10.919> and<00:04:11.010> all<00:04:11.069> those<00:04:11.220> things<00:04:11.400> you

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
can see it needs to be sharpened these

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.430 
can see it needs to be sharpened these
shiny<00:04:15.989> parts<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.680> blade<00:04:16.949> are<00:04:17.449> words

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
shiny parts on the blade are words

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.930 
shiny parts on the blade are words
coming<00:04:19.799> dull<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:21.650> because<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:22.980> soft<00:04:23.280> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
coming dull and because it's so soft the
