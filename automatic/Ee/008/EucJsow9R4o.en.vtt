00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
probably wouldn't see it but I find this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.510 
probably wouldn't see it but I find this
horn<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.549> be<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.770> standard<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.369> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
horn to be of the standard of the

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
Yannick asawa it's a it's a very

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.160 
Yannick asawa it's a it's a very
flexible<00:01:28.640> horn<00:01:29.180> if<00:01:29.360> I'm<00:01:29.479> playing<00:01:29.780> in<00:01:30.080> a

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
flexible horn if I'm playing in a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.899 
flexible horn if I'm playing in a
traditional<00:01:30.770> setting<00:01:31.040> if<00:01:31.340> I'm<00:01:31.460> playing<00:01:31.640> more

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
traditional setting if I'm playing more

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.179 
traditional setting if I'm playing more
contemporary<00:01:32.479> in<00:01:33.350> even<00:01:33.860> some<00:01:34.009> other

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
contemporary in even some other

experimental<00:01:34.729> types<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.270> music<00:01:35.509> I<00:01:35.600> think<00:01:35.780> this

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
experimental types of music I think this

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.960 
experimental types of music I think this
horn<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.290> very<00:01:36.560> very<00:01:36.890> flexible<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.460> can<00:01:37.610> do<00:01:37.820> it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
horn is very very flexible and can do it

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.700 
horn is very very flexible and can do it
what<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.180> needed<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.600> do<00:01:38.810> I've<00:01:39.290> been<00:01:39.439> trying<00:01:39.680> to

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
what I needed to do I've been trying to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.100 
what I needed to do I've been trying to
push<00:01:40.009> it<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.250> see<00:01:40.430> how<00:01:40.610> far<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.299> threshold<00:01:41.900> is

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
push it to see how far this threshold is

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.289 
push it to see how far this threshold is
and<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:42.740> pretty<00:01:42.920> powerful<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.490> has<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.150> can

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
and it's pretty powerful it has it can

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.410 
and it's pretty powerful it has it can
take<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.509> lot<00:01:44.780> of<00:01:44.810> air<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:47.180> has<00:01:47.390> a

combination<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:49.460> highs<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.240> lows

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
combination of the highs and the lows

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.950 
combination of the highs and the lows
it's<00:01:51.649> those<00:01:51.979> little<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.520> high<00:01:52.700> end<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.479> my

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
it's those little and a high end for my

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.889 
it's those little and a high end for my
style<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.470> playing<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.610> has<00:01:56.329> a<00:01:56.360> piercing

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
style of playing but it has a piercing

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.719 
style of playing but it has a piercing
sound<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.530> cuts<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.220> goes<00:01:58.399> really

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
sound and it cuts and it goes really

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.060 
sound and it cuts and it goes really
straight<00:01:59.119> ahead<00:01:59.270> but<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.740> round

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
straight ahead but it's a it's a round

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.819 
straight ahead but it's a it's a round
sound<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.969> still<00:02:02.270> stays<00:02:02.570> within<00:02:02.840> for<00:02:03.560> me<00:02:03.649> with

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
sound it still stays within for me with

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.679 
sound it still stays within for me with
the<00:02:03.920> Annika<00:02:04.250> saw<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.820> jana<00:02:05.000> gasol<00:02:05.360> wa<00:02:05.540> is

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
the Annika saw is the jana gasol wa is

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.289 
the Annika saw is the jana gasol wa is
around<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.530> sound<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.040> love<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.820> think

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
around the sound and I love it I think

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.719 
around the sound and I love it I think
this<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.570> great<00:02:09.140> evolution<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.640> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
this is a great evolution for the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.910 
this is a great evolution for the
company<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.690> think<00:02:11.900> anybody<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:12.590> that
