00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
there um horizontal hold control that's

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.840 
there um horizontal hold control that's
a<00:02:14.640> very<00:02:14.880> very<00:02:15.210> crude<00:02:15.680> control<00:02:16.680> their<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:17.760> them

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
a very very crude control their see them

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.760 
a very very crude control their see them
is<00:02:17.970> where<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> cord<00:02:18.540> should<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.470> dry

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
is where the cord should go and dry

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.510 
is where the cord should go and dry
rotted<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.250> there's<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.830> original<00:02:23.190> or

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
rotted and there's the the original or

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.770 
rotted and there's the the original or
the<00:02:23.550> cord<00:02:24.120> i<00:02:24.240> think<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> original

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
the cord i think this is the original

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.260

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.630 
TV on this TV is really not i would say
electronically<00:02:39.990> safe<00:02:40.320> even<00:02:41.160> though<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> guy

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
electronically safe even though the guy

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.460 
electronically safe even though the guy
had<00:02:41.880> plugged<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.360> nothing<00:02:42.750> happened<00:02:43.200> i

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.680 
had plugged it in and nothing happened i
don't<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.370> i<00:02:44.520> would<00:02:44.580> dare<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> do<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.180> just

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
don't think i would dare to do this just

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
don't think i would dare to do this just
because<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:47.700> don't<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.480> don't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510

because I just don't I don't I don't
even<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.650> rigged<00:02:49.920> up<00:02:50.070> here

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
even like this this is rigged up here

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.210 
even like this this is rigged up here
it's<00:02:51.060> not<00:02:51.240> safe<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.900> does<00:02:52.800> not<00:02:52.830> match<00:02:53.190> up

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
it's not safe that's does not match up

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.570 
it's not safe that's does not match up
to<00:02:53.580> my<00:02:53.700> standards<00:02:54.240> at<00:02:54.360> all

not<00:03:10.800> use<00:03:11.220> everything<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.540> would

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
not use everything that up that would

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.640 
not use everything that up that would
probably<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:13.160> should<00:03:14.160> probably<00:03:14.520> be<00:03:14.700> used<00:03:14.970> but

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
