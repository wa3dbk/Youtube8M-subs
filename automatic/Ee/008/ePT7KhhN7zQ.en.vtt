00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:05.620
 welcome again the channel 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.089
 welcome to a new video tutorial on 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.340
 this video tutorial I will explain 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.560
 something that I see that people get tangled 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.690
 I do not know why, but it 's the truth 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.119
 fairly easy to manufacture fast which is 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.070
 is to change the language of games in 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.650
 playstation 4 many people download game 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.999
 simply install a disk and not but 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.130
 the world is in English I wanted it in 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.329
 Spanish where the whole race just me 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.939
 has happened with the killzone that there is not 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.099
 way to put it in Spanish true te 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.710
 subtracted all playstation 4 games 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.270
 they are in Spanish for my concept 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.250
 I do not know any that I do not have almost 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.210
 I'm going to make the program easy for you 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.180
 at this moment I have the playstation 4 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.370
 In the language I have it in Spanish. Spain 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.570
 but in normal Spanish we're going to open by 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.520
 example a game that I want to give 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.010
 quite a headache that calls channel 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.420
 or whatever you want to call it with this game 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.010
 today something very strange that told me that 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.920
 was one hundred percent downloaded 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.600
 complete game and I but why not 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.720
 it comes out in Spanish I want it in Spanish 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.130
 one thing the other the normal one that started 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.850
 the game as well as what they are seeing in 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.860
 this instant 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.689
 and something was happening that upsets me 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.240
 It drives me crazy because good in output 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.490
 and the little doll to the right and she 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.350
 is in Spanish all normal but 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.259
 but but they are going to see and now to see you 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.540
 the newton is caught it came out to me that 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.670
 press a button contains a game and see 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.770
 that is in normal English I closed the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.080
 true game I put it in Spanish when 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 I put it in Spanish the language change 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.890
 I had understood that it was changing 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.039
 language I am there I had it basic and 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.220
 We put Spanish Latin America true 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.840
 Spanish to Latin America sorry what 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.030
 happens is that I put it one at 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.159
 sink the options button 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.960
 information came out to me that was 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.050
 downloading a part was not worth 30 not 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.020
 would be complete but missing as 600 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.000
 You do something like that, but I do not know 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 I saw how despair I did not see it go 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.880
 what you have to see when you 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 change the language, look at the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.630
 games if you guys know they're 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.720
 completely downloaded since they were going to 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.549
 see that he spoke gray and just what 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.200
 weird little rage like that I 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.539
 I slept and I left the thing if I assume 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.540
 sleep better so when I woke up to 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.659
 another day I was going to play look at what 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.000
 had downloaded everything complete then 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:20.940
 open the normal game 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 they were going to see they are going to see here what 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.390
 which then starts and they'll see that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.610
 says press a button is completely 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.290
 in Spanish Latin America nothing of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.330
 Spanish this because a lot of people throw 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.010
 the games in Spanish is good in Spain 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.900
 then you know people give you 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.840
 information as I am showing you and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.140
 they give him what he expects here he leaves 35 0 58 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.160
 gigabytes of 38.0 58 gigabyte wants 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.440
 say the game is completely 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.940
 downloaded there is all the languages not 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.260
 I know if I put French or album it 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.520
 downloaded another language the truth I do not have 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.500
 idea of that but I have no interest in 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.850
 Spanish people if they liked it if it served 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.230
