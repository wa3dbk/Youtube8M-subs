like half time I play and so whenever I
be<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.889> co-op<00:03:45.219> the<00:03:45.430> very<00:03:45.639> first<00:03:45.819> time<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.090> play<00:03:46.450> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
be to co-op the very first time I play I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.839 
be to co-op the very first time I play I
inherently<00:03:47.709> think<00:03:47.980> maybe<00:03:48.189> we<00:03:48.370> screwed<00:03:48.639> up<00:03:48.669> a

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
inherently think maybe we screwed up a

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.149 
inherently think maybe we screwed up a
roll<00:03:49.030> or<00:03:49.060> two<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.500> which<00:03:50.620> very<00:03:50.859> well<00:03:51.069> we

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
roll or two and in which very well we

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.830 
roll or two and in which very well we
may<00:03:51.340> have<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.639> rule<00:03:52.060> book<00:03:52.269> has<00:03:52.479> a<00:03:52.510> lot<00:03:52.810> of

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
may have the rule book has a lot of

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.689 
may have the rule book has a lot of
stuff<00:03:53.229> inside<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:53.919> so<00:03:54.280> we<00:03:54.400> may<00:03:54.549> have

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
stuff inside of it and so we may have

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.729 
stuff inside of it and so we may have
made<00:03:54.909> made<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.209> huge<00:03:55.780> stakes<00:03:56.079> even<00:03:56.349> though<00:03:56.620> we

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
made made a huge stakes even though we

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.409 
made made a huge stakes even though we
did<00:03:56.889> make<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.069> more<00:03:57.280> diverse<00:03:57.849> yeah<00:03:58.090> we<00:03:58.269> did

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
did make it more diverse yeah we did

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.729
