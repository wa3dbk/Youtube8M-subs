00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
yeah there was this one time that I

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
one hundred percent digital there seems

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.860 
one hundred percent digital there seems
to<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> niche<00:02:25.549> resurgence<00:02:26.549> in<00:02:26.730> film<00:02:27.060> use<00:02:27.360> how

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
to be a niche resurgence in film use how

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.869 
to be a niche resurgence in film use how
about<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> series<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.709> videos<00:02:29.040> about<00:02:29.250> instant

photography<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:32.000> would<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.239> would<00:02:33.390> love<00:02:33.659> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
photography I would I would love to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.500 
photography I would I would love to
spend<00:02:34.019> some<00:02:34.260> time<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.769> film<00:02:35.340> photography<00:02:35.610> I've

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
spend some time on film photography I've

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.360 
spend some time on film photography I've
wanted<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.110> play<00:02:37.379> around<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.829> alternative

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
wanted to play around with alternative

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.240 
wanted to play around with alternative
processes<00:02:38.849> for<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.299> long<00:02:39.599> time<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> wouldn't

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
processes for a long time so I wouldn't

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.880 
processes for a long time so I wouldn't
rule<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.430> out<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.930> agree<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
rule it out and I agree that there is a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.729 
rule it out and I agree that there is a
resurgence<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.700> film<00:02:44.940> use<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.500> in

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
resurgence of film use I think that in

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.309 
resurgence of film use I think that in
various<00:02:47.370> arts<00:02:47.670> there's<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.209> move<00:02:48.450> towards<00:02:49.019> what

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
various arts there's a move towards what

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.860 
various arts there's a move towards what
is<00:02:49.349> considered<00:02:49.769> today<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:51.150> authenticity

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
is considered today to be authenticity

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.229 
is considered today to be authenticity
like<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.069> buy<00:02:53.190> vinyl<00:02:53.609> records<00:02:54.090> in

like you can buy vinyl records in

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.750 
like you can buy vinyl records in
supermarkets<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.230> film<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.129> making<00:02:56.609> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
supermarkets and film is making a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.970 
supermarkets and film is making a
resurgence<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:58.109> know<00:02:58.230> even<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.650> like

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
resurgence and you know even in like

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.880 
resurgence and you know even in like
food<00:02:59.280> trends<00:03:00.019> they're<00:03:01.019> headed<00:03:01.290> towards<00:03:01.560> small

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
food trends they're headed towards small

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.690 
food trends they're headed towards small
organic<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.940> local<00:03:03.269> farms<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.159> so<00:03:05.159> with<00:03:05.340> with

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
organic and local farms and so with with

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.670 
organic and local farms and so with with
photography<00:03:06.299> I<00:03:06.329> think<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.690> lot<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> times<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
photography I think a lot of times the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.720 
photography I think a lot of times the
focus<00:03:08.430> can<00:03:08.609> be<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.450> result<00:03:10.129> but<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.400> lot<00:03:11.700> of

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
focus can be on the result but a lot of

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.009 
focus can be on the result but a lot of
times<00:03:12.230> people<00:03:13.230> think<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.040> process

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
times people think that the process

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.509 
times people think that the process
loading<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.140> film<00:03:16.379> double-checking<00:03:17.370> your

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
loading the film double-checking your

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.819 
loading the film double-checking your
settings<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.480> having<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.139> you<00:03:19.260> know<00:03:19.349> a<00:03:19.380> preview

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
settings not having a you know a preview

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.330 
settings not having a you know a preview
of<00:03:19.889> your<00:03:19.980> image<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:21.630> process<00:03:22.319> can<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.980> be

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
of your image that process can really be

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.970 
of your image that process can really be
a<00:03:23.549> challenge<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.870> really<00:03:25.230> make<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
a challenge and can really make the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.069 
a challenge and can really make the
result<00:03:26.370> more<00:03:26.519> rewarding<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:28.049> that

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
result more rewarding and with that

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.069 
result more rewarding and with that
thought<00:03:28.349> I'm<00:03:28.919> done<00:03:29.690> actually<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> have<00:03:30.900> more

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079
