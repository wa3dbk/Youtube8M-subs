give<00:01:46.760> this<00:01:46.910> boat<00:01:47.180> actually<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:48.040> compound<00:01:49.040> as

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
give this boat actually a compound as

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.670 
give this boat actually a compound as
well<00:01:49.430> prior<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.210> using<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.660> but<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.200> wanted<00:01:51.620> to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
well prior to using this but I wanted to

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.800 
well prior to using this but I wanted to
show<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.010> just<00:01:52.850> exactly<00:01:53.060> how<00:01:53.480> good<00:01:53.690> this

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
show you just exactly how good this

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.760 
show you just exactly how good this
stuff<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.290> if<00:01:55.160> I<00:01:55.280> can<00:01:55.430> just<00:01:55.520> come<00:01:55.730> around<00:01:55.850> here

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
stuff is if I can just come around here

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.420 
stuff is if I can just come around here
we<00:01:57.770> can<00:01:59.290> hopefully<00:02:00.290> just<00:02:00.650> zoom<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.100> bit

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.010 

and<00:02:04.430> you<00:02:04.520> can<00:02:04.700> see<00:02:08.050> see<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.229> actual

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.990 

shine<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:15.380> then<00:02:15.500> if<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.740> just<00:02:19.000> take

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
shine on that and then if we just take

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.850 
shine on that and then if we just take
the<00:02:20.060> camera<00:02:20.510> off<00:02:24.940> we<00:02:25.940> will<00:02:26.120> come<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.860> I

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the camera off we will come in and I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.300 
the camera off we will come in and I
think<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:31.370> actually<00:02:31.790> see<00:02:33.310> without

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
think you can can actually see without

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.180 
think you can can actually see without
shine<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.660> mean<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.870> was<00:02:35.960> so<00:02:36.230> easy<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.710> do<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
shine and I mean it was so easy to do a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.450 
shine and I mean it was so easy to do a
lot<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.880> waxes<00:02:38.590> are<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.650> lot<00:02:40.070> harder<00:02:40.250> because

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
lot of waxes are a lot harder because

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.940 
lot of waxes are a lot harder because
they<00:02:40.670> have<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.820> great<00:02:41.210> content<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:42.020> talcum

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
they have a great content of talcum

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.930 
they have a great content of talcum
powder<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:44.750> come<00:02:44.990> around<00:02:45.080> there<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:46.670> will<00:02:46.820> be

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
powder just come around there it will be

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.560 
powder just come around there it will be
getting<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.650> nice<00:02:48.650> clean<00:02:49.070> view<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:50.420> we've

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
getting a nice clean view of what we've

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.450 
getting a nice clean view of what we've
just<00:02:50.600> done<00:02:50.900> there<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> problem<00:02:52.280> with<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
just done there and the problem with the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.100 
just done there and the problem with the
talcum<00:02:52.850> powder<00:02:52.880> they<00:02:53.210> use<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.480> for<00:02:53.510> bulking<00:02:53.960> up

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
talcum powder they use it for bulking up

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.310 
talcum powder they use it for bulking up
the<00:02:54.980> actual<00:02:55.130> product<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.780> does<00:02:57.020> when<00:02:57.200> it

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
the actual product and that does when it

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.920 
the actual product and that does when it
dries<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:57.920> white<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:59.000> also<00:02:59.300> thicker<00:02:59.600> makes

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
dries it's white it's also thicker makes

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.180 
dries it's white it's also thicker makes
it<00:03:00.080> harder<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:01.220> actually<00:03:01.400> clean<00:03:01.880> off<00:03:02.090> your

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
it harder to to actually clean off your
