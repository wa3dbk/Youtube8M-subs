00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hello everyone, today we have a little 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.490
 unusual build they usually on two 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.170
 things first is a computer with a top 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.710
 video cards for a relatively small 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 the price 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.880
 Well , secondly, this color is white 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.920
 always distinctively distinguished among 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 the rest of their black counterparts 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.390
 so you have a computer in front of you 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.900
 for 40 thousand rubles from the top 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.740
 gtx 780 video card and pretty powerful 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.090
 modern core i5 44 40 processor 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.949
 generation x name is such a processor 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.250
 should be more than enough for disclosure 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.380
 Capacity 1 magic 780 video card 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.670
 the case in front of us from the company zalman 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 z3 plus models 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.379
 made in this world and I do not know how 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 to you, and to me personally, a very white case 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.180
 like especially with blue backlight 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 as in this model of the case of the zalman ruler 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.840
 z recently became just 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 popular favorites since salt 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.440
 relatively low price it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.210
 approximately two to two s 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 half a thousand rubles they offer 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.829
 beautiful and good functionality and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 excellent workmanship 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.090
 Some models have such 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.100
 nice addition as a management 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.979
 temperature display fans 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.390
 or side window as in this model 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.189
 zalman cooling system 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.619
 rulers z also well done 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.150
 for example in this case 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.200
 front mounted 120 millimeter 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.360
 the fan is the same fan 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 mounted at the rear and two more of the same 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 top on will ufa hot air in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.170
 This box has a side window 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.580
 as I said, although the installation does not 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.710
 reference graphics card yet 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.900
 desirable of course so long 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.689
 blowing fan or vice versa 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.850
 blowing a video card on the same side 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.040
 wall for example like models z9 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.479
 well and now let's review from the external 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.140
 We finally go to the review 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.060
 internal components like me already and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.950
 said before us ready assembled 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.820
 system costing about 40 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.979
 thousand rubles 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.299
 I want to emphasize that this cost is not 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.979
 individual components by 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.869
 minimum value of Yandex Market 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.850
 the cost of the finished product is finished 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.430
 solutions with our three year warranty and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.200
 our maintenance this system 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.880
 is a good example of how 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.189
 relatively low price can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 build a computer with top video 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.590
 modern card saving at the same time 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.119
 on other companies 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.010
 which does not affect so much 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.930
 performance such as operational 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.030
 memory or motherboard 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.040
 and yet trying to save money 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.690
 for the sake of powerful stupid video cards not 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.370
 forget that to reveal it 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.390
 building needs a powerful modern 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.280
 CPU 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.660
 that is why in this system we do not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.220
 steel economy on it and took 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.670
 modern quad processor 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.910
 core i5 44 40 is a processor on a chip 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.680
 called at 33 gigahertz it costs 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.769
 almost the same as the eight core 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.599
 processor from mg fx 8350 but at the same time 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.040
 most games and even some 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.340
 applications he bypasses by 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.690
 CPU performance by md 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 cool on soon again cooler so 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.870
 same from the company zalman model cnps5x 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.459
 since the 4440 is not designed 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.560
 for overclocking then choose something more 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.420
 expensive for its cooling is not much 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.310
 sense but if you are still an amateur 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.500
 absolute silence in all modes and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.690
 low temperatures for example 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.180
 below 50 you can look at something 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.950
 more expensive in this system 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.069
 inexpensive power supply from 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.859
 Chiftek 700 Watt DPS 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.870
 This power supply has a good margin. 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.220
 on power for this system therefore 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.290
 even despite its low 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.299
 cost it will cope perfectly with 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.430
 powering up for this computer 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.810
 disk subsystem on this assembly 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.340
 based on the hard drive from 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.040
 seagate model barracuda 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.410
 with a capacity of 1 terabyte 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.030
 dwell on the video card here 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.400
 we have installed almost top 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.220
 the solution among 1 video card chips is 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.500
 model gtx 780 brand performance 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.569
 asus companies from their cooling system 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.639
 directcu 2 this model is equipped 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.590
 backplate ohm to protect small 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.269
 components on the back of the video card 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.910
 accidentally damaged when 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.440
 installation for top video cards 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.180
 had to save a little on 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.349
 motherboard and here we have installed 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.269
 model from the company gigabyte jane p85 d3 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.099
 but this is no less than full-sized 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.530
 model with a decent set of interfaces 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.599
 not as stripped down as we are not x 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.250
 boards the only savings in 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.970
 RAM is what it is 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.830
 set one bar they 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.870
 I did so cheaper but it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.250
 8 gigabyte bar with frequency 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.440
 1600 megahertz 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.900
 from a gay company this is not the cheapest 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 memory and has a good and decent 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.830
 quality so what we got in 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.960
 the result is, by and large, relatively 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.640
 a small amount of 40 thousand rubles we 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.650
 got enough productive 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.150
 system with almost stomped video 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.780
 card and modern powerful 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.520
 processor 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.140
 but with all our savings we 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.880
 tried to make a system which 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.510
 will look decent like the outside so 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.820
 and inside 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.140
 as for the performance of this 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.360
 systems then if you will use 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.770
 the resolution is not higher than full hd and not 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.450
 will be messing with extreme 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.780
 anti-aliasing settings in modern 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.910
 games 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.380
 then on this system can be quite 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.540
 comfortable to play games like 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.390
 krayzis 3 battlefield 4 and the rest 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.920
 highly demanding games like this 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.690
 unusual and interesting and beautiful 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.580
 the system visited me today on 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.350
 review, as always, thanks to the store 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.480
 stones for providing a review 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.130
 computer thank you all for your attention 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.669
 subscribe to my channel and to new 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.669
 meeting
