00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
it's made of a double stack layers paper

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.009 
it's made of a double stack layers paper
over<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.810> over<00:00:18.869> again<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:23.150> cardboard<00:00:24.150> but

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
over and over again and cardboard but

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.950 
over and over again and cardboard but
it's<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:25.949> cardboard<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:27.810> can

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it's not like cardboard it's you can

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
it's not like cardboard it's you can
find<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> back<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.980> pad<00:00:29.820> spiral

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
find on the back of a pad spiral

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.950 
find on the back of a pad spiral
notebooks<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.280> spring<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.570> magazine

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
notebooks so the spring and the magazine

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.369 
notebooks so the spring and the magazine
ramp<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.680> made<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> spring<00:00:39.629> itself<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.230> made

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
ramp is made the spring itself is made

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.040 
ramp is made the spring itself is made
from<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.829> spiral<00:00:41.340> notebook<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:44.579> ramp<00:00:44.789> is

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
from a spiral notebook and the ramp is

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.360 
from a spiral notebook and the ramp is
pretty<00:00:46.050> much<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.230> same<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> max<00:00:47.010> made<00:00:47.219> out

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
pretty much the same as a max made out

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
pretty much the same as a max made out
of<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:48.360> push<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:54.020> see<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> spring<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
of just push it up and see the spring is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.080 
of just push it up and see the spring is
not<00:00:55.739> strong<00:00:56.100> enough<00:00:56.129> though<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
not strong enough though so I'm going to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.400 
not strong enough though so I'm going to
let<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.309> spring<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.320> little<00:01:01.320> bit

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
let make it and you spring a little bit

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.450 
let make it and you spring a little bit
longer<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:03.769> take<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.799> pressure

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
longer so can just take the pressure

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.510 
longer so can just take the pressure
from<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.450> cartridges<00:01:10.159> like<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.220> said<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
from the cartridges like I said this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.360 
from the cartridges like I said this
will<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> cool<00:01:12.299> 25<00:01:13.729> but

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
will be a cool 25 but

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.940 
will be a cool 25 but
I<00:01:16.460> do<00:01:17.060> not<00:01:17.450> have<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:18.290> 25<00:01:18.770> APR<00:01:19.000> 380<00:01:20.000> round<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.320> do

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
I do not have the 25 APR 380 round I do

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.760 
I do not have the 25 APR 380 round I do
have<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.700> 40<00:01:23.000> Smith<00:01:23.210> &amp;<00:01:23.270> Wesson<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:24.500> i<00:01:24.560> will<00:01:24.740> be

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
have the 40 Smith &amp; Wesson so i will be

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.620 
have the 40 Smith &amp; Wesson so i will be
using<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.570> twenty<00:01:27.050> five<00:01:27.170> htp<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:29.360> works

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
using so the twenty five htp it works

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.300 
using so the twenty five htp it works
the<00:01:29.810> same<00:01:29.870> way<00:01:30.080> but<00:01:30.320> it's<00:01:30.980> going<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.220> be<00:01:31.280> a

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
the same way but it's going to be a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.050 
the same way but it's going to be a
little<00:01:31.460> bit<00:01:33.100> different<00:01:34.100> probably<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:34.970> little

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
little bit different probably a little

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.550 
little bit different probably a little
bit<00:01:35.210> wider<00:01:35.480> to<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:35.870> but<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:38.600> goes<00:01:39.350> in

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
bit wider to you but so just goes in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.620 
bit wider to you but so just goes in
like<00:01:39.890> any<00:01:40.130> other<00:01:40.520> natural<00:01:41.060> gun<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:44.450> i<00:01:44.570> said

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
like any other natural gun like i said

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.810 
like any other natural gun like i said
we<00:01:44.960> do<00:01:45.080> not<00:01:45.110> own<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.500> cult<00:01:45.920> 24<00:01:46.400> anything<00:01:46.700> they

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
we do not own a cult 24 anything they

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.030 
we do not own a cult 24 anything they
use<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:47.180> 25<00:01:47.690> HP<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.410> only<00:01:48.530> have<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.740> smith<00:01:49.010> &amp;

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
use this 25 HP you only have a smith &amp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.160 
use this 25 HP you only have a smith &amp;
wesson<00:01:49.400> sigma<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:50.000> uses<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:51.250> 40<00:01:53.170> it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
wesson sigma that uses this 40 it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.470 
wesson sigma that uses this 40 it
doesn't<00:01:54.530> not<00:01:54.680> hold<00:01:55.070> seven<00:01:55.940> or<00:01:56.060> eight<00:01:56.150> rounds

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
doesn't not hold seven or eight rounds

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.860 
doesn't not hold seven or eight rounds
so<00:01:56.660> i<00:01:56.720> went<00:01:56.870> to<00:01:56.990> hold<00:01:57.520> because<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.090> springs<00:01:59.570> is

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
so i went to hold because the springs is

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.870 
so i went to hold because the springs is
not<00:02:00.080> strong<00:02:00.470> i'm<00:02:01.100> going<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.550> admit

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
not strong i'm going to have to admit

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.820 
not strong i'm going to have to admit
the<00:02:01.970> whole<00:02:02.150> new<00:02:02.300> spring<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.170> we'll<00:02:03.320> be<00:02:03.440> doing

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
the whole new spring so we'll be doing

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.550 
the whole new spring so we'll be doing
this<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.090> can<00:02:05.180> see<00:02:05.650> this<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.890> for<00:02:07.190> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
this as you can see this is for the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.880 
this as you can see this is for the
spring<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.860> stuck<00:02:10.310> down<00:02:10.550> there<00:02:12.820> so<00:02:14.560> that's<00:02:15.560> why

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
spring is stuck down there so that's why

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.630 
spring is stuck down there so that's why
i'm<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.400> make<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.700> whole<00:02:17.120> new

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
i'm going to have to make a whole new

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.229 
i'm going to have to make a whole new
spring<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:20.120> nothing<00:02:21.130> but<00:02:22.130> that's<00:02:22.730> not<00:02:22.970> too

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
spring for nothing but that's not too

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:31.210 
spring for nothing but that's not too
difficult<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.940> know<00:02:29.380> just<00:02:30.380> put<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.800> up<00:02:30.890> it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
difficult so you know just put it up it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.420 
difficult so you know just put it up it
for<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:32.050> just<00:02:33.050> magazine<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:33.890> I've<00:02:34.220> also

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
for this just magazine but I've also

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.030 
for this just magazine but I've also
started<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.440> slide<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:39.610> do<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.820> real<00:02:41.180> quick

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
started the slide so do that real quick

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.260 
started the slide so do that real quick
so<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.640> slide<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.570> made<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:46.270> layered

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
so this is a slide it's made of layered

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.390 
so this is a slide it's made of layered
paper<00:02:47.570> pretty<00:02:47.930> much<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.070> get

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
paper pretty much in what I do is I get

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.430 
paper pretty much in what I do is I get
courts<00:02:49.880> from<00:02:50.060> wine<00:02:50.330> bottles<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.989> champagne

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440
