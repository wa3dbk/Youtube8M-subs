00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.279 

my<00:00:06.279> name<00:00:06.490> is<00:00:06.730> Walter<00:00:07.089> in<00:00:07.330> Guam<00:00:07.509> and<00:00:07.720> this<00:00:08.049> is

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:08.289 
my name is Walter in Guam and this is

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.100 
my name is Walter in Guam and this is
how<00:00:08.740> to<00:00:08.799> estimate<00:00:09.099> the<00:00:09.639> square<00:00:10.059> root<00:00:10.329> with<00:00:10.839> big

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
how to estimate the square root with big

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.730 
how to estimate the square root with big
numbers<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.940> if<00:00:13.360> we<00:00:14.019> have<00:00:14.379> a<00:00:14.409> big<00:00:14.769> number<00:00:15.009> like

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
numbers so if we have a big number like

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.480 
numbers so if we have a big number like
576<00:00:18.150> say<00:00:19.150> and<00:00:19.510> we<00:00:19.840> want<00:00:20.110> to<00:00:20.380> estimate<00:00:20.830> what<00:00:21.190> the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
576 say and we want to estimate what the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.260 
576 say and we want to estimate what the
square<00:00:21.850> root<00:00:22.180> is<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:23.710> can<00:00:23.920> try<00:00:24.280> to<00:00:24.340> look<00:00:24.880> for

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
square root is we can try to look for

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.320 
square root is we can try to look for
other<00:00:25.600> large<00:00:26.170> numbers<00:00:26.680> which<00:00:27.160> we<00:00:27.400> do<00:00:27.700> know<00:00:27.970> the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
other large numbers which we do know the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.920 
other large numbers which we do know the
square<00:00:28.690> root<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.250> for<00:00:30.550> example<00:00:30.580> we<00:00:31.270> know

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
square root of so for example we know

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:40.319 
square root of so for example we know
that<00:00:34.019> 576<00:00:35.039> is<00:00:36.039> less<00:00:36.699> than<00:00:37.030> 900<00:00:37.329> and<00:00:39.329> larger

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
that 576 is less than 900 and larger

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.790 
that 576 is less than 900 and larger
than<00:00:40.589> 400<00:00:41.589> and<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:43.149> know<00:00:43.359> that<00:00:43.659> the<00:00:44.440> square

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
than 400 and we know that the square

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.059 
than 400 and we know that the square
root<00:00:45.069> of<00:00:45.809> 400<00:00:47.069> is<00:00:48.069> equal<00:00:48.460> to<00:00:48.640> 20<00:00:49.739> pretty<00:00:50.739> easily

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
root of 400 is equal to 20 pretty easily

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.500 
root of 400 is equal to 20 pretty easily
and<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.989> square<00:00:53.379> root<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.829> 900<00:00:54.729> is<00:00:55.149> equal

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
and that the square root of 900 is equal

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
and that the square root of 900 is equal
to<00:00:55.659> 30<00:00:56.339> so<00:00:57.339> we<00:00:57.370> know<00:00:57.729> that<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.239> square<00:00:58.600> root<00:00:58.780> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to 30 so we know that the square root of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.119 
to 30 so we know that the square root of
576<00:01:00.309> must<00:01:00.969> lie<00:01:01.299> somewhere<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.499> between<00:01:02.620> these

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
576 must lie somewhere in between these

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.820 
576 must lie somewhere in between these
two<00:01:03.399> numbers<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.809> next<00:01:05.140> step<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.470> could<00:01:05.650> do

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
two numbers the next step you could do

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.990 
two numbers the next step you could do
is<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:07.090> take<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.300> look<00:01:07.570> at<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.310> unit's<00:01:09.730> place

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
is to take a look at the unit's place

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500 
is to take a look at the unit's place
here<00:01:10.390> if<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:10.930> know<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.560> square<00:01:11.920> root

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
here if you know that the square root

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500 
here if you know that the square root
exists<00:01:13.510> as<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.720> whole<00:01:13.990> number<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.560> ask<00:01:15.520> well

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
exists as a whole number and ask well

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.610 
exists as a whole number and ask well
what<00:01:16.810> number<00:01:17.290> 1<00:01:18.160> squared<00:01:18.700> has<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.780> six<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.380> the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
what number 1 squared has a six in the

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.130 
what number 1 squared has a six in the
unit's<00:01:20.980> place<00:01:21.330> turns<00:01:22.330> out<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.630> there<00:01:23.110> are

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
unit's place turns out that there are

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.700 
unit's place turns out that there are
two<00:01:23.470> numbers<00:01:23.880> there's<00:01:24.880> four<00:01:25.450> when<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.320> square

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
two numbers there's four when you square

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.530 
two numbers there's four when you square
it<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.920> get<00:01:27.190> 16<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.920> theres<00:01:29.920> also<00:01:30.160> 6<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:31.420> you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
it you get 16 and theres also 6 when you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.560 
it you get 16 and theres also 6 when you
square<00:01:31.870> six<00:01:32.290> you<00:01:33.250> get<00:01:33.460> 36<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:37.030> could<00:01:37.270> have

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
square six you get 36 so we could have

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.540 
square six you get 36 so we could have
either<00:01:38.020> 24<00:01:38.920> or<00:01:40.080> 26<00:01:41.550> be<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.730> square<00:01:43.120> root<00:01:43.360> of

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
either 24 or 26 be the square root of

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.050 
either 24 or 26 be the square root of
576<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:47.650> wanted<00:01:47.980> to<00:01:48.040> we<00:01:48.430> could<00:01:48.760> either

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
576 and if we wanted to we could either

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.300 
576 and if we wanted to we could either
take<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.750> average<00:01:49.870> of<00:01:50.230> these<00:01:50.410> or<00:01:50.680> we<00:01:51.130> could

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
take the average of these or we could

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.000 
take the average of these or we could
actually<00:01:51.490> check<00:01:52.030> directly<00:01:52.780> if<00:01:53.260> we<00:01:54.130> square<00:01:54.750> 24

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
actually check directly if we square 24

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.030 
actually check directly if we square 24
it<00:01:57.010> turns<00:01:57.310> out<00:01:57.550> we<00:01:58.150> get<00:01:58.330> exactly<00:01:59.580> 576<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:02.440> we

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
it turns out we get exactly 576 so we

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.850 
it turns out we get exactly 576 so we
know<00:02:03.250> from<00:02:04.060> these<00:02:04.360> easy<00:02:04.780> limits<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.710> are

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
know from these easy limits that are

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.749 
know from these easy limits that are
easily<00:02:06.700> calculable<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:09.220> square<00:02:09.460> root

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
easily calculable that the square root

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.950 
easily calculable that the square root
had<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.179> be<00:02:10.330> between<00:02:10.780> 20<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.410> 30<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.630> we

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
had to be between 20 and 30 and we

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.120 
had to be between 20 and 30 and we
the<00:02:14.920> other<00:02:15.130> places<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:15.880> guidance<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:17.200> what

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
the other places as guidance for what

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.290 
the other places as guidance for what
exactly<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.060> number<00:02:19.540> should<00:02:19.570> be

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
exactly that number should be

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.890 
exactly that number should be
alternatively<00:02:22.300> if<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.350> some<00:02:24.100> large

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
alternatively if you have some large

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.090 
alternatively if you have some large
number<00:02:26.730> say<00:02:29.520> 9670<00:02:30.520> 3<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:32.380> wanted<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.800> get

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
number say 9670 3 and you wanted to get

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.850 
number say 9670 3 and you wanted to get
an<00:02:33.370> order<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.940> magnitude<00:02:34.110> estimate<00:02:35.110> for<00:02:35.710> what

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
an order of magnitude estimate for what

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.970 
an order of magnitude estimate for what
the<00:02:35.980> square<00:02:36.280> root<00:02:36.490> should<00:02:36.760> be<00:02:37.560> then<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.740> can

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
the square root should be then you can

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.500 
the square root should be then you can
simply<00:02:39.550> round<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.900> nearest<00:02:42.510> ten

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
simply round it to the nearest ten

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.900 
simply round it to the nearest ten
thousand<00:02:44.140> here<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:47.050> see<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.670> is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
thousand here and you see that this is

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.600 
thousand here and you see that this is
equal<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.570> square<00:02:49.720> root<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.320> 10<00:02:51.010> raised<00:02:51.580> to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
equal to the square root of 10 raised to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.650 
equal to the square root of 10 raised to
the<00:02:51.940> fourth<00:02:52.240> power<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.370> 10<00:02:55.090> raise<00:02:55.630> to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the fourth power so you have 10 raise to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.100 
the fourth power so you have 10 raise to
4<00:02:56.200> divided<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.870> simply

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
4 divided to here and that's simply

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.730 
4 divided to here and that's simply
equal<00:02:59.740> to<00:03:00.090> 10<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.720> second<00:03:02.170> power<00:03:02.320> or<00:03:02.710> a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
equal to 10 to the second power or a
