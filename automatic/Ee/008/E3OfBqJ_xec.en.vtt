 saynow if there were many mysterious sightings she says she is there 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.670
 a lot of activity in the sky at night there are photos of strange objects there 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.980
 even the explosion of a mysterious aircraft in the valleys on the right 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.070
 I believe it is a combination of aliens working with our government 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.509
 and that their meeting point is in the pollicino military base 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.990
 and here we are at the heart of the mysteries 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.500
 the so-called area 51 an aviation base so secret that up to 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.250
 recently the US government even denied that it existed 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.490
 and on which the inhabitants of Greece anunaki reopen there will be water and soap 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 I have about forty miles from this place there is a military base 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.380
 he explains very secretly, of which the American government is not only performing 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.390
 experiments for new conventional aircraft is also enough by studying the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.580
 flying saucer technology 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.630
 the bassist live at the beginning of the 50s and she is such a secretary that she doesn't 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.930
 they can even check the news on the level of pollution produced by 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
 a mysterious material that has already caused the death of two employees e 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.840
 pregnancy 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 how many employees 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.920
 this area 51 also made famous by a successful film such as the president 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.900
 discovers that free turnout. the military perform experiments on national fall 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.740
 the 50s in the desert 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.440
 this area 51 is the symbol of how the US government treats the issue 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.090
 UFO 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.700
 first of all 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.650
 and it doesn't matter if the legs are said so unlikely you deny the evidence yes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.420
 they tell stories clearly about 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.479
 something like this happened at his most famous episode of 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.150
 sighting of aliens 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.130
 in this desert area in my Mexico near a town that the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130
 world center of believers 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.220
 fifty years after the sighting of deformed courts and twisted wreckage 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.350
 the American air force presented an official explanation 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.180
 is what happens in 1947 an explanation that did not convince either 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.840
 the most skeptical of the skeptics 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.020
 if i open this is the problem with ufo america believes in extraterrestrials 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.690
 pitti believes there has been some contact and there is 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.680
 someone also goes to one of them and bike hopkins a journalist who wrote a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.569
 famous book 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.939
 in which he tells the story of courtyard linen a woman claims to be 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.940
 She was kidnapped in the middle of the night by her bed in a New York home at 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.889
 modal shoulders in his testimony a comment enters their album both 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.710
 I am found out of my end 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.900
 rips put into a smoky bluish light with a medium 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.820
 slowly I felt relieved inside this strange tan 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.050
 seemed to be like an invisible lift but I could only look 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.740
 before 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.380
 I could not move that is not even my opinion and well I owe only the part 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.019
 lower than the spaceship seemed to me to look inside a volcano then 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.620
 ah they are found in a room that looks like a doctor's office sitting on a table 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.479
 by exam or so it seemed I was taking specimen of my skin 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.659
 I heard beat on my back I don't know if with a fist with one in a thousand ce 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.999
 the ago 4 5 being around me they were more or less a meter and twenty high they had 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.799
 big blue watery eyes depth and phrase were telling me something but not 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.659
 I could see the lips moving, maybe they were talking to me telepathically 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.619
 a very scary all star experience and not just scary for her 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.210
 assures the writer bat box 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.070
 the fact is that from this as in other testimonies it would appear clear at least 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.000
 to him and her the aliens are trying to create a mixed race of earthlings 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.300
 who are still a bit sommacal martial with what objective is not known e 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.249
 of course a bit of polite skepticism don't do even though I've made it 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.420
 which is his message to the mountains 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.990
 skeptical that he considers all this a madness, in short, a section
