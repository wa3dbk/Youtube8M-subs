notice about this ski is the shape it's

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.520 
notice about this ski is the shape it's
hard<00:01:00.800> not<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.070> it's<00:01:01.879> got<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:02.180> huge<00:01:02.480> nose<00:01:03.289> on

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
hard not to it's got this huge nose on

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.370 
hard not to it's got this huge nose on
it<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.149> what<00:01:05.149> that<00:01:05.180> does<00:01:05.539> it<00:01:05.899> it<00:01:06.080> gives<00:01:06.289> you

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
it and what that does it it gives you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.290 
it and what that does it it gives you
plenty<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:06.710> float<00:01:06.950> off<00:01:07.130> piste<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:07.759> on<00:01:08.060> peace

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
plenty of float off piste and on peace

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.180 
plenty of float off piste and on peace
it<00:01:08.930> gives<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:09.289> quite<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.560> short<00:01:10.009> effective

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
it gives you quite a short effective

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.520 
it gives you quite a short effective
edge<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.450> skis<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.780> lot<00:01:11.990> shorter<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:12.470> it

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
edge so it skis a lot shorter but it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.529 
edge so it skis a lot shorter but it
makes<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:12.920> really<00:01:13.640> quite<00:01:13.970> nimble<00:01:14.210> and

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
makes it really quite nimble and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.870 
makes it really quite nimble and
responsive<00:01:14.979> considering<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.310> only

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
responsive considering this is only

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.730 
responsive considering this is only
ninety<00:01:17.240> nine<00:01:17.390> mill<00:01:17.660> underneath<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.170> foot<00:01:18.380> it

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
ninety nine mill underneath the foot it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.680 
ninety nine mill underneath the foot it

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
feels a lot wider when you take it off

bubble<00:01:41.479> tech<00:01:41.660> on<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.840> tip<00:01:42.110> just<00:01:42.649> means<00:01:42.920> that

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
bubble tech on the tip just means that

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.730 
bubble tech on the tip just means that
you<00:01:43.190> get<00:01:43.369> loads<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.300> flow<00:01:44.509> in<00:01:44.690> soft<00:01:44.990> snow<00:01:45.110> but

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
you get loads of flow in soft snow but

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.410 
you get loads of flow in soft snow but
also<00:01:45.830> when<00:01:46.130> you're<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.369> piece<00:01:46.610> it's<00:01:47.030> creating

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
also when you're on piece it's creating

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.779 
also when you're on piece it's creating
quite<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.660> short<00:01:47.899> effective<00:01:48.380> edge<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.580> a

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
quite a short effective edge so it's a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.449 
quite a short effective edge so it's a
very<00:01:50.179> easy<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.630> use<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.560> 99<00:01:52.250> mil
