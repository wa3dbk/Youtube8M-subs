00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.920
 there is a way to reach 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.699
 the vast far-off lands of the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.919
 earth there is a cure that goes 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.820
 upset the world and revolutionize the 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.739
 church mission 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.830
 these lower vices think smaller 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.970
 loose hold and go take a coffee 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.970
 [Applause] 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.320
 I know what you 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.510
 amazing why I did not think about it 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.770
 before to fully understand the importance 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.460
 of this statement 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.960
 let's go back 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.210
 sun is a star among 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.800
 billion in the universe and the earth is 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.900
 one of the smallest planets that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.940
 turn around this sun on our 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.730
 planet it is over 2 million 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.160
 of different species known to date from 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.020
 half are insects ten years ago 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.369
 thousand tree species and 15 thousand 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.740
 four hundred and eighty-two species 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.560
 different from the fish our planet 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.100
 is alive despite our efforts explore 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.320
 the stars 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.600
 we did not find a hint of life 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.619
 otherwise not even the smallest of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.660
 bacteria nothing the message of the bible of 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.789
 Jesus salvation is all that we 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.119
 call the good news were written 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.890
 for you and for every human being 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.450
 the only problem is that everyone 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.789
 has not yet had the chance to 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.740
 to hear it 6 billion people 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.790
 live on the planet for a duration 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.250
 67 years old 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.470
 only one third of the total population of 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.740
 terror to direct access to the good 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.659
 news 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.700
 the other two thirds have never 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.960
 heard of Jesus and can not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.240
 so not follow him 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.100
 that gives us an average of 67 years for 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.500
 reach them 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.520
 its surface 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.079
 he gets used to it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.729
 close to genes if they speak a 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.710
 other language and if it went to the same 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.159
 match that we make to complicate 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.619
 things 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.460
 we are well under 67 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.920
 to reach them 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.959
 what is extraordinary is that more 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.069
 humans are aging - they are changing 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.590
 their way of thinking 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.160
 if anyone believes and follows Jesus when 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.230
 he is a child 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.959
 he will certainly believe until his 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.940
 dead and of course after also another 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.950
 side someone who does not hear about 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.620
 of Jesus during his childhood risk of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.720
 never follow him at the moment 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.630
 only 15% of the donation for the mission 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.440
 sale to children while 60 to 80% of 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.610
 conversions instead among children if 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.620
 it was costing short of all 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.390
 inhabitants of the earth we would see 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.110
 one person in three is under 15 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.239
 years when Jesus says the outcome realm 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.530
 belongs to those who are like them 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.640
 must make us think about our 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.500
 priorities 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.140
 the first challenge of Christ's mission 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 it's reaching the children so he 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.129
 must you aim lower the good 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.340
 new of the gain the harvest is great 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.810
 but there are more workers 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.730
 around the world a lot of kids 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.640
 and young people are already at workmen's 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.830
 the harvest the call for the lost does not 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.470
 does not start at 30 but already during 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.700
 childhood and adolescence 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.799
 children may not know 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.510
 as many things as an adult but we 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.069
 can count on the enthusiasm of 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.900
 their youth is what they know 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.750
 the good news they know prayed 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.819
 to share and serve in their own way the 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.099
 world population is rising rapidly 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.739
 there is a growing number of children and 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.540
 a decreasing number of adults the only 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.400
 means of maintaining contact with 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.920
 children it's in the team some 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.660
 to reach others he says you have 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.760
 hiding these things from the wise and the 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.859
 intelligent and you revealed them to 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.879
 children then I have to think 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.230
 smaller and you think smaller 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.560
 by observing the churches through the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.900
 world 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.209
 we see that some are well equipped 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.450
 and in good health but that it does not 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.129
 not grow and on the other hand we see 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.660
 churches full of energy that 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.120
 grow quickly but have not 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.940
 no financial means 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.049
 if we want to evangelize effectively 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.849
 feed and equip the children 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.489
 we have all agreed to 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.959
 to share our sources more freely 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.789
 abandoned the idea of ​​building empires and 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.380
 give priority to building the 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.090
 Kingdom of God 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.980

 all the resources all the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.950
 creativity or mandate to do it

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.960
 and creates links
