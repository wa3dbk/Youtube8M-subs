00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you can't really affect what people are

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
you can't really affect what people are
gonna<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.390> about<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.439> about

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
gonna think about it or not think about

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.539 
gonna think about it or not think about
it<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.009> mean<00:01:53.159> they're<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.340> have

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it you know I mean they're gonna have

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370 
it you know I mean they're gonna have
their<00:01:53.670> own<00:01:53.790> opinions<00:01:54.210> based<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> last<00:01:55.110> one

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
their own opinions based on the last one

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
their own opinions based on the last one
and<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.729> can't<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.060> do

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and that's not really we can't really do

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.389 
and that's not really we can't really do
much<00:01:57.270> about<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.920> think

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
much about that I don't think so I think

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.740 
much about that I don't think so I think
we<00:01:59.460> might<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.640> selling<00:02:00.060> ourselves<00:02:00.180> short<00:02:00.479> if

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
we might be selling ourselves short if

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.719 
we might be selling ourselves short if
we<00:02:00.869> let<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> pressure<00:02:01.770> us<00:02:02.070> too<00:02:02.280> much<00:02:02.430> into

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
we let it pressure us too much into

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.969 
we let it pressure us too much into
doing<00:02:03.030> something<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.799> people

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
doing something you know that people

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.800 
doing something you know that people
could<00:02:05.310> compare<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> Merriweather<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.659> way

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
could compare to Merriweather in a way

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.020 
could compare to Merriweather in a way
you<00:02:07.020> know<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.140> feel<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.280> want<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.819> try

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
you know I feel like we just want to try

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
you know I feel like we just want to try
and<00:02:09.239> wit<00:02:09.450> Brian<00:02:09.959> Owen<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.410> felt<00:02:10.679> really<00:02:10.830> good

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and wit Brian Owen I felt really good

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.470 
and wit Brian Owen I felt really good
about<00:02:11.069> Mary<00:02:11.550> whether<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.970> liked<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> lot

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
about Mary whether we liked it a lot

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.280 
about Mary whether we liked it a lot
it's<00:02:12.660> one<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.930> better

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it's one of the better

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.800 
it's one of the better
recording<00:02:14.250> experiences<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.120> ever<00:02:15.269> had<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.750> I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
recording experiences we ever had so I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.750 
recording experiences we ever had so I
think<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.110> us<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:16.560> just<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.890> try<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.670> do

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
think for us it was just to try and do

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.460 
think for us it was just to try and do
something<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.239> felt<00:02:18.569> as<00:02:18.750> strongly<00:02:19.079> about

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
something that we felt as strongly about

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410 
something that we felt as strongly about
and<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.069> could<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> psyched<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.209> you

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and we could be a psyched on and you

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.490 
and we could be a psyched on and you
know<00:02:21.510> could<00:02:21.720> stand<00:02:21.959> behind<00:02:22.079> and<00:02:22.379> that's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
know could stand behind and that's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.759 
know could stand behind and that's
usually<00:02:22.650> all<00:02:22.950> we're<00:02:23.099> trying<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.939> in

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
usually all we're trying to do so in

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.210 
usually all we're trying to do so in
2010<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.950> released<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.489> solo<00:02:27.030> album<00:02:28.069> did<00:02:29.069> you

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
2010 you released a solo album did you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.970 
2010 you released a solo album did you
have<00:02:29.370> more<00:02:29.579> of<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.790> carte<00:02:30.060> blanche<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:30.980> than

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
have more of a carte blanche then than

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.000 
have more of a carte blanche then than
now<00:02:32.180> does<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.329> feel<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.440> could<00:02:34.620> do<00:02:34.739> more

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
now does it feel like you could do more

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.369 
now does it feel like you could do more
perhaps<00:02:35.870> then<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.440> or<00:02:37.799> yeah<00:02:38.159> um<00:02:39.379> not

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
perhaps then with that or yeah um not

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.910 
perhaps then with that or yeah um not
really<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.769> mean<00:02:41.900> again<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.290> something<00:02:43.829> I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
really I mean again it's not something I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.979 
really I mean again it's not something I
keep<00:02:44.159> in<00:02:44.310> mind<00:02:44.489> in<00:02:44.730> terms<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:45.209> what<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.690> feel<00:02:45.840> is

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
keep in mind in terms of what I feel is

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.140 
keep in mind in terms of what I feel is
gonna<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.409> respected<00:02:47.250> or<00:02:47.459> not<00:02:47.700> respected

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
gonna be respected or not respected

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.430 
gonna be respected or not respected
that's<00:02:48.269> what<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> mean<00:02:48.690> I'm<00:02:48.900> not<00:02:48.930> really<00:02:49.140> sure

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
that's what you mean I'm not really sure

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.890 
that's what you mean I'm not really sure
I<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.620> feel<00:02:49.950> like<00:02:50.239> for<00:02:51.239> something<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.720> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I just feel like for something like that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.330

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
or even for some well this is different

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.500 
or even for some well this is different
because<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.700> such<00:02:53.849> like<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.060> collective

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
but I can't really say that I was

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.539 
but I can't really say that I was
worried<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:25.349> much<00:03:25.530> about<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:26.190> know<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.310> just

worried so much about you know I just
knew<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.790> had<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.180> these<00:03:27.389> ideas<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.989> minun

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
knew I had this these ideas and minun

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.300 
knew I had this these ideas and minun
knew<00:03:28.349> I<00:03:28.379> wanted<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.829> do<00:03:28.949> I<00:03:28.980> mean<00:03:29.160> that's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
knew I wanted to do I mean that's

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.979 
knew I wanted to do I mean that's
similarly<00:03:29.699> similar<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.419> how<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.510> approached

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
similarly similar to how I approached

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.539 
similarly similar to how I approached
this<00:03:31.199> animal<00:03:31.590> collective<00:03:31.919> record<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.340> just

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
this animal collective record it's just

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.670 
this animal collective record it's just
that<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.540> three<00:03:33.810> other<00:03:33.930> people<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.500> are

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
that I have three other people that are

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.439 
that I have three other people that are
standing<00:03:35.280> behind<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.669> as<00:03:35.790> well<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.269> are<00:03:36.359> like

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
standing behind it as well that are like

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.909 
standing behind it as well that are like
yeah<00:03:36.599> these<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:36.989> ideas<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.500> all<00:03:37.709> makes

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
yeah these are the ideas this all makes

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.159 
yeah these are the ideas this all makes
sense<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:38.519> what<00:03:39.000> was<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.329> Soto<00:03:39.629> record<00:03:39.989> about

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
sense so what was that Soto record about

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.909 
sense so what was that Soto record about
for<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:43.230> change<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.799> the

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
for you it's just a change in the

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.720 
for you it's just a change in the
transition<00:03:44.180> mostly<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.980> going<00:03:46.980> from<00:03:47.190> maybe

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
transition mostly of going from maybe

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.970 
transition mostly of going from maybe
some<00:03:48.000> dark<00:03:48.180> dark<00:03:48.750> times<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.500> getting<00:03:49.769> out<00:03:49.859> of

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
some dark dark times like getting out of

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.860 
some dark dark times like getting out of
a<00:03:50.069> relationship<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:51.329> serious<00:03:51.690> relationship

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
a relationship a serious relationship

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.250 
a relationship a serious relationship
and<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.919> renewal<00:03:53.879> you<00:03:54.090> know<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.049> theme

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
and and renewal you know that the theme

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.930 
and and renewal you know that the theme
of<00:03:55.470> death<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.980> guess<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.489> way<00:03:56.609> that<00:03:56.849> it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
of death I guess in the way that it

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.599 
of death I guess in the way that it
renews<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.870> starts<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:59.099> know<00:03:59.220> starts

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
renews and and starts you know starts

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.970 
renews and and starts you know starts
life<00:03:59.790> again<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.329> then<00:04:00.449> allowed<00:04:01.349> me<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.650> move

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
life again and then allowed me to move

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.890 
life again and then allowed me to move
on<00:04:02.159> to<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.519> this<00:04:02.909> time<00:04:03.180> period<00:04:03.629> in<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.780> way

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
on to this this time period in a way

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.479 
on to this this time period in a way
just<00:04:04.169> get<00:04:04.290> rid<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.590> some<00:04:04.829> stuff<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:05.310> was<00:04:05.400> on

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
just get rid of some stuff that was on

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:05.990 
just get rid of some stuff that was on
my<00:04:05.639> mind

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
my mind

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.059 
my mind
and<00:04:06.239> being<00:04:06.569> very<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.959> where<00:04:07.199> we're<00:04:07.470> inward<00:04:07.859> and

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
and being very in where we're inward and

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.280 
and being very in where we're inward and
looking<00:04:08.340> at<00:04:08.430> myself<00:04:08.690> did<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.810> totally<00:04:10.139> get

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
looking at myself did you totally get

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.839 
looking at myself did you totally get
rid<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.680> or<00:04:10.859> are<00:04:11.010> some<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.370> those<00:04:11.519> moods

rid of it or are some of those moods

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.089 
rid of it or are some of those moods
perhaps<00:04:12.359> also<00:04:12.989> there<00:04:13.470> there<00:04:13.739> might<00:04:13.979> have<00:04:14.010> been

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
perhaps also there there might have been

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.399 
perhaps also there there might have been
some<00:04:14.370> lingering<00:04:14.669> stuff<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.389> on<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.840> record<00:04:16.019> I

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
some lingering stuff and on the record I

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.050 
some lingering stuff and on the record I
feel<00:04:16.979> like<00:04:17.070> right<00:04:17.250> now<00:04:17.280> I'm<00:04:17.579> feeling<00:04:17.909> pretty

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
feel like right now I'm feeling pretty

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.949 
feel like right now I'm feeling pretty
good

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
good

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.559 
good
but<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.919> know<00:04:20.039> I'm<00:04:20.489> not<00:04:20.850> feeling<00:04:20.910> pretty<00:04:21.389> good

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:21.569 
but you know I'm not feeling pretty good

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.809 
but you know I'm not feeling pretty good
somedays<00:04:22.049> -<00:04:22.319> so<00:04:22.620> it's<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:22.830> what<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.610> you

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
somedays - so it's like what is it you

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.999 
somedays - so it's like what is it you
know<00:04:23.910> nobody's<00:04:24.449> ever<00:04:24.569> good<00:04:25.470> all<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.770> time<00:04:25.979> I

guess are there certain tracks perhaps

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.050 
guess are there certain tracks perhaps
