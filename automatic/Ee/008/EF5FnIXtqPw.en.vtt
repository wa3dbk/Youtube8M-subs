00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.059
 hi friends how are you in this video 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.480
 I bring an application that is good for 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.759
 for the mind to the brain as 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.029
 the brain is also another muscle that 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.310
 many of us because he does not exercise and 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.619
 we have to exercise what because 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.919
 that all the muscles so that it does not 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.840
 lose strength do not lose power and good at 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.210
 This application is very good because 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.450
 have special exercises for 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.019
 streamline the mind the brain to 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.420
 make it stronger and good we go here 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.280
 what this application is about is 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.100
 that every day you improve your ability 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.800
 for example in a game you made 500 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.090
 points the next day 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.920
 you're probably going to do more there's more 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.860
 odds that you will do many more 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.470
 points and good what I'm going to do now 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.020
 I already have about five days using them and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.170
 almost always good most of the 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.330
 90% times because I make more points than 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.090
 what I did last time right now I'm going to 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.970
 see how it goes and well I'm going to start the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.360
 training here is the training 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.580
 free duration five minutes and good 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.760
 let's see if I overcome the workouts 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.650
 well yesterday and well let's see how 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.190
 here here says my score 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.130
 previous is 472 I have to overcome that 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.050
 today and well I will not leave you all the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.630
 exercise because if it would be a long time 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.460
 this video no more now I will explain 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.830
 what is this game about and already after 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.640
 I will advance all that in order not to lose much 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.160
 weather 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.970
 well here the game is let's start 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.610
 the exercise 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.430
 and good here what we have to do is 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.800
 follow the sequence 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.700
 Well, I'll start, I will not talk anymore 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.700
 then he deconcentrated me 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.769
 Well, as you can see today, do not exceed what 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.590
 what I did yesterday, I mean 472, I'll be a 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.180
 little stressed and the truth is that no or 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.569
 I could not complete it but let's see 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 the next exercise and good here is 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.950
 a fact that comes out here and well let's 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.530
 continue this the maximum score is 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.739
 232 Let's see if I get over it and good 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.120
 let's start here I have to locate 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.120
 where will you find the point 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.349
 and good friends here you can see that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.390
 I exceeded my maximum score and I 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.519
 increase the difficulty well here in 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.590
 this exercise if it can increase then 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.040
 with a score that means that 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.470
 I'm grabbing more agility and good such 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.000
 once in a few you can not in a day not 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.010
 You can overcome what you did the day 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.590
 gone but then you keep trying 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.200
 every day and you are going to see that yes you will be good 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.940
 I will continue with the training 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.260
 here if it is a little more complicated 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.720
 you can see that the maximum is 1000 23 and 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.660
 let's see how this is about math 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.209
 a number comes out that you have to go 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.260
 subtracting adding by dividing 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.329
 multiplying this is a little more 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.329
 difficult good let's do the exercise 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.930
 and good as you can see here I got over my 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.569
 personal score here well then if I 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.000
 they saw that if I got a good one 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.849
 because if I kind of blocked myself but if 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.009
 I surpassed my previous goal and good 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.039
 let's continue with the last 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:09.669
 exercise this if it's difficult for me 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.569
 little the maximum score of 456 and we're going 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.569
 Let's see how it goes 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.030
 Well, here as you can see me 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.240
 increase the difficulty increase of 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.520
 mental score and good well I think 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.520
 I finished everything here the four 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.560
 daily exercises and good here already 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.660
 you can see the difficulty in which I am 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.840
 doing the exercises and the points that 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.540
 says good I think in three if it exceeds my 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.970
 score on the there roads there yes the 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.090
 truth is that it gives me a little bad I'm bad 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.930
 in in that memory of remembering 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.430
 where things are located there if I'm bad and 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.200
 Well, I hope you lower this 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.270
 application is very good and you them 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.100
 It can serve and well if you liked the 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.260
