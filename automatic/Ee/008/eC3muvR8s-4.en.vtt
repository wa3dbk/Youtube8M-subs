so we mask the neck off with paper to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.080 
so we mask the neck off with paper to
protect<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.199> from<00:01:05.379> stain<00:01:08.790> anything<00:01:09.790> that

could hurt it also we're stating only

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.249 
could hurt it also we're stating only
the<00:01:13.090> maple<00:01:13.420> top<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:16.270> put<00:01:16.479> tape<00:01:16.690> lines<00:01:16.990> on

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
three different shades of yellow there

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.690 
three different shades of yellow there
ranging<00:04:06.230> from<00:04:06.410> like<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> caramel<00:04:07.100> butterscotch

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
ranging from like a caramel butterscotch

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.450 
ranging from like a caramel butterscotch
all<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.060> way<00:04:08.150> up<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> neon<00:04:08.840> yellow<00:04:12.460> which

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
all the way up to a neon yellow which

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.449 
all the way up to a neon yellow which
obviously<00:04:14.240> as<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:14.930> see<00:04:15.080> yourself

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
obviously as you can see yourself

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:27.350 
obviously as you can see yourself
enhances<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.640> natural<00:04:16.790> beauty<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.390> wood

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.850 

all<00:04:27.750> right

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
all right

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.420 
all right
I<00:04:29.979> said<00:04:30.490> that's<00:04:30.669> one<00:04:30.879> of<00:04:30.969> our

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
I said that's one of our

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.020 
I said that's one of our
quicker<00:04:33.770> simpler<00:04:34.770> staying<00:04:35.070> jobs<00:04:35.400> but<00:04:35.759> you<00:04:35.880> can

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
quicker simpler staying jobs but you can

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.790 
quicker simpler staying jobs but you can
see<00:04:36.150> actually<00:04:36.720> how<00:04:36.840> beautiful<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.500> now

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
see actually how beautiful it is now

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.779 
see actually how beautiful it is now
from<00:04:38.639> this<00:04:38.790> point<00:04:40.100> we<00:04:41.100> would<00:04:41.250> pull<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.580> tape

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
from this point we would pull the tape

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.090 
from this point we would pull the tape
cut<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.840> binding<00:04:43.020> which<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.590> essentially

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
cut the binding which is essentially

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.010 
cut the binding which is essentially
rounding<00:04:44.550> over<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.880> edge<00:04:45.030> with<00:04:45.300> sandpaper<00:04:45.630> by

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
rounding over the edge with sandpaper by

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.400 
rounding over the edge with sandpaper by
hand<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.979> get<00:04:47.190> this<00:04:47.310> nice<00:04:47.610> uniform<00:04:48.600> line<00:04:48.840> that

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
hand to get this nice uniform line that

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.210 
hand to get this nice uniform line that
traces<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.889> top<00:04:50.810> from<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:51.990> point<00:04:52.199> we<00:04:52.979> spray

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
traces the top from that point we spray

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.710 
traces the top from that point we spray
a<00:04:53.250> sealer<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.970> guitar<00:04:54.300> grain<00:04:55.139> fill<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:56.720> let

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
a sealer on the guitar grain fill it let

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.600 
a sealer on the guitar grain fill it let
all<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.020> dry<00:04:58.320> then<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.830> goes<00:04:58.979> on<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.430> next

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
all that dry then it goes on to the next

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.150 
all that dry then it goes on to the next
stage<00:04:59.880> which<00:05:00.539> would<00:05:00.720> be<00:05:00.840> base<00:05:01.050> coat<00:05:01.289> spray<00:05:01.440> now

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
stage which would be base coat spray now

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.120 
stage which would be base coat spray now
depending<00:05:02.520> on<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.729> base<00:05:02.910> model

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.130 

yes
