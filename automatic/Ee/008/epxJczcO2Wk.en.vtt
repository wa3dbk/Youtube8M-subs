00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.200
 SU-122-44, the Soviet seventh-order value-added chariot 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.220
 Is a fast, agile, low profile vehicle with a good main gun 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.850
 It is not the best eviction vehicle, but it is still very effective 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.110
 Its high maneuverability is very useful in the ninth order battle. 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.680
 SU-122-44 is very agile 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.940
 And can easily accelerate to a speed of 47km / h 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.480
 It can quickly change position and sneak into the enemy's back 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.650
 Fire, then detach 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.110
 For this car, due to the low accuracy of the main gun, the sniper play is not very suitable for it. 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 And the enemies at this level have strong armor. 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.400
 SU-122-44 does not penetrate the front armor of the E75, even the APCR ammunition 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.340
 In this case, the best role of SU-122-44 is 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.310
 Launch an attack with a friendly medium-sized tank 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.310
 You will be able to fight the ninth-order medium-sized chariot very efficiently. 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.310
 Contribute to the team through their front armor 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.910
 Almost no SU-122-44 can't be penetrated 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 Fifth to eighth order chariot 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.200
 Thanks to its low profile, this squad can be used to launch attacks in hiding places without being discovered. 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.020
 The main gun of SU-122-44 is D-25S 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.450
 Has 175mm armor and 390 average damage 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.080
 One of the most powerful main guns in this class 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.880
 Other Soviet cars can only get a similar main gun after a full upgrade. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.280
 One minute of firing rate is 7.5 rounds, which does not take into account the incoming gear, team training and skills 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.970
 So, every minute it can output amazing 2925 damage 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.000
 This is very good in the seventh-order vehicle. 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.000
 By its performance 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 SU-122-44 is still very confident in the face of heavy-duty chariots 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.220
 Such as IS 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.080
 Most of the sixth-order vehicles have no way to survive the attack of two shells. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.710
 It should be noted that due to the low accuracy of the main gun, not every shell has a way to cause damage. 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.850
 But high filling speeds can make up for this. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.420
 When it is at the top of the team 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 SU-122-44 is leaning against its armor 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.280
 Bold attack on any map 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.000
 90mm thick front armor and 75mm thick side armor – very good at this level 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.340
 The huge cannon shield is very reliable, and the first armor only takes up a small area. 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.140
 Look at this front! This is a 60 degree tilted armor. 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.570
 Only shells with an armor-piercing capacity greater than 175mm have the ability to penetrate it. 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.000
 Despite this, the rate of bouncing is still not small. 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.220
 When you are loading, you may wish to turn the body slightly 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.480
 And enjoy the sound of jumping. 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.280
 Remember, don't rely on this technique when fighting a 9th-order vehicle. 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.910
 Light and medium-sized tanks have always been a threat to be faced when the chariots are unhelpful 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.400
 In any case, this does not apply to SU-122-44 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.050
 Its body steering speed is very fast - 42 degrees per second 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.600
 This speed is faster than most of the same medium-sized tanks. 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.400
 SU-122-44 has the same shortcomings as other vehicles in the Soviet technology tree. 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.370
 Its aiming speed is slow and the distance is not far 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.650
 Basic line of sight is 330 meters 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.170
 This means that you will need to rely on the investigation of teammates. 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.880
 Of course, line of sight can still be improved by equipment, team training and skills. 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.850
 Required equipment including shots and quick aiming 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 The last piece of equipment is up to you. 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.970
 You can choose binoculars if you don't mind letting your teammates investigate 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.400
 You can also choose a fan to increase the rate of fire and aiming time. 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.740
 The commander’s sixth sense skill when the team member begins training 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.050
 And the hidden skills of all the members will be the basic skills 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.340
 Other team members' training and skills will be available to the player. 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.850
 Expulsion chariots are best for team operations 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.140
 When other teammates attract the attention of the enemy, they will give SU-122-44 a good time to output accurate firepower. 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.480
 When it's driving to understand these characteristics, SU-122-44 will be a deadly chariot 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.170
 It will be able to output a lot of damage 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.080
 Convert position and continue shooting 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.280
 And a lot of damage also represents a lot of income after the end of the battle. 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.340
 "High damage and high income", what else do you want to ask in the expulsion chariot? 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.570
 If you like this Soviet expulsion chariot, you will be able to buy it at the gift shop. 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.140
 If you want to know more 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.310
 This special page will give you more details about this vehicle. 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.000
 Thank you for watching! See you on the battlefield.
