00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.179

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.150
 what do you bring now this is why 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.830
 why three for pots 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.830
 let's see the list of materials 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.300
 what we are going to need are straws 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.220
 wooden chopsticks cardboard pieces 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.890
 golden or colored spray paint 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.650
 that you want black rat tail the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.750
 lace golden beads scissors I want 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.970
 clarify that the black rat tail is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:53.010
 what we have here is not going to walk 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:56.930
 you telling him the mimosa like the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.930
 video this greeting of the mimosa 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.980
 it does not matter these the rat tail that 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.320
 we need in Miss Rat's tail 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.530
 and then then how do we start 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.530
 rat is not fat 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:23.910
 that is to say that we are going to start a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.090
 necklace of pots and creativity and the 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.280
 true that very many apart and I do 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.440
 I'm going to make one the truth myself too 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.580
 rivals in arid and this kind of thing 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.980
 it highlights very parents and so we are going to take 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.650
 the pots and cut them in 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.350
 2.4 centimeters oral care one 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.460
 inch are two points five senses in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.540
 the right thing not 2.4 2.5 2.5 centimeters 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.210
 an inch to see then the look are 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.500
 mark the pot and we are already working 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.780
 in a collar a cloak but that the most 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.670
 important here is to recycle there 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.980
 reuse what we think is no longer 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.470
 serves and that we can contribute to the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.660
 world to make less garbage 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.880
 those those how are you going well how are you doing well 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.510
 I finished marking do not look 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.510
 one and a half times first to dance 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.380
 To the seriousness I believe that the seriousness 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.920
 it only serves to 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.360
 to wrinkle and make you happy 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.360
 seriousness does not work do not you think 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.930
 I like everything there is only one 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.769
 electronic music that says in psycho 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.580
 and I know if I can not stand it taisha if I do not 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.140
 like 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:56.709
 I feel that suddenly I will end up with 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.709
 81 fighter 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.319
 then the next step if I set aside 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.629

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.360

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.610

 beautiful thousand christ is not that you if you read 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.900
 this is if you're cutting them well 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.180
 that I'm going to cheat and I'm going to cut 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.430
 two in two because if they do not pay me 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.430
 Colors of colors I distinguish 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.420
 I have the habit of putting myself 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.220

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.830

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.830

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.670
 fly 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.430

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.930
 test culture on the right 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.510
 another verbal this this is not so much 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.750
 cultural but you know that par excellence 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:21.000

 today it is difficult sometimes to see better 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.550
 if I put in the short time 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.350
 has substantiated the diu is the instrument 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.350
 it is a wind instrument 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.880
 a long long piece of wood 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.479
 where it's about touching it 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.919
 making a breath 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.470
 circulatory never stops ringing the 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:08.949
 trap is in making is in the mouth 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.780
 when you breathe throat seals not 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:15.370
 they attended you put up your tongue you breathe 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.389
 that is, while he is removing those horns 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.910
 big guy that sounds like bass I met him 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:25.510
 if in mazunte I saw it is impressive is 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.970
 a super strong you can only sound it in 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.110
 two or three nothing more notes did not come down 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.669
 you piano notes of size or 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.280
 amount of air that you are sending then 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.740
 then to be able to rehearse that 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.500
 breathing the best that can be is 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.750
 with a straw put it in a glass with water 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.440
 in case someone needs to develop the 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.440
 ability 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:57.569
 and apart that is the day in australia 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:07:00.020
 You can count the cost we 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.020
 a cut 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.280
