00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.139
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.969
 further test how that of me is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.179
 extra from around in this video I show 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.220
 you shall sniper rifle that eye of 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.100
 occurrences at bludenz 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 that would be the type had here partially 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.510
 that apple in the offer 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.130
 with the premiums with a bit of luck 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.970
 came the network who just because 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.369
 pull out 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 Let's go sit on the eye 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.960
 If you see it is 10 o'clock with a fall 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.469
 extremely high rate of fire the shed 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 helped compares that to make it very good 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.610
 you can only see that one big 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 Difference is the stability and the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.280
 then make something out first 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 again, the power even harm 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 then we have a standard change 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.840
 My personal favorite here is short 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.489
 look slh 10 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.350
 mtv ii then eagle eye slr 20 but so 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.689
 You will see that we are very, very happy 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.659
 big and also blocks a lot of 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.350
 the view for this reason short view 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 Sla 10 My favorite then a man army 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.310
 kills without assistance with this week 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.590
 reduce your grenades as well as melee 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.420
 cooldown 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.950
 this will be demonstrated briefly 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.659
 As you can see when I kill an enemy 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.729
 without harming you anyway 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.680
 the other player got the go 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 grenades as well as the nachkommt 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.860
 cooldown pretty heavy down 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.330
 that means you can get the grenades and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 offspring skills much faster 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.880
 again put it back then then 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.560
 could have her fix suit this week can 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 to become incredible tradition 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.729
 Snapshot is super fast 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.729
 with this moped or even sent 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.560
 increased range and accurate 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.670
 I would recommend for pv 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.270
 also ray ttc snapshot for pvp 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.950
 you would pull there much faster 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.600
 last we would have relentless with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.269
 this week is the goal at the front 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.280
 he is also very useful for 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:17.910
 the pvp bvb then rather less well 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.760
 I'll show you in pv so dvi 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.420
 that's the short slh 10 now 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.170
 As you can see, you do not come too far 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.870
 the scola very briefly that is now 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.430
 Eagle eye someone sees you too much closer 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.859
 The only problem is when I'm there 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.519
 you see, that will be a lot of fun 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.519
 screen 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.950
 now shortly before , the netbook had mails 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.580
 extremely fast what do the concerns 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.580
 as you can see here 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.540
 With five shots in the magazine you have a lot 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.550
 a lot of shot and if you 're sure 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.550
 you can kill many opponents with it 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.260
 if you want to go in at dusk 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.060
 the weapon is then active 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.020
 sure as well as extremely fun 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:30.460
 and that's actually a good one 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:35.740
 we grant pvg and thus have it 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.980
 we bv completed and good against cvp 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.020
 So bvb in pvp the weapon is right 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.220
 strong because the high married the 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.210
 makes itself felt 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.970
 plays like credit thing so that 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.890
 new trade all the scan also has one 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.990
 high rate of fire the lack of stability 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.160
 somehow this does not notice 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.180
 as you can see and the fire rate makes 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.960
 very noticeable 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.420
 probably it is the last mountain 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.730
 that the stability is not too drastic 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.400
 goes down 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.340
 that's the same as the sets 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.769
 are very nasty pvp aligned 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.530
 So from my side a clear pvp 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.609
 weapon and for the new pair of freaks really 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.919
 to be recommended because as you saw in front 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.780
 The first ruler can not sit 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.250
 you just follow suit and once the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.320
 Give a shot in the chest and if you can 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.000
 Of course we have to deal with good ones 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.870
 you can also loose two times 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.220
 Three enemies in the distance needs to kill 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.220
 Of course, a bit of luck, too 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.940
 then we put the weapons together 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.620
 the weapon is for the pvp 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.180
 average sniper rifle the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.789
 National damage that can happen 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.960
 circumstances at dusk or in arena 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.500
 be very useful 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.120
 al soofi spvg yes if you can have them 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.820
 one uses them one is her 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.419
 amusing but not at the moment 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.120
 necessarily built for the pvp met but 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.150
 their purpose has an average 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.639
 sniper rifle cvp, on the other hand, is her 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.950
 really good through the lectures 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.840
 Can you do a lot with that? 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.820
 sniper trade my side one 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.010
 clear recommendation i think it's very good 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.010
 and will she do it to me if I like 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.389
 with the play sniper rifle 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.970
 in that sense that was mine 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.720
 review on this sticker thank you 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.639
 for watching 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.010
 Leave a lighter and check it 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.720
 car out on the left side 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.400
 there are more videos and on it 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.620
 the right side let's play offs ahead 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.190
 thank you for watching until the 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.190
 next video
