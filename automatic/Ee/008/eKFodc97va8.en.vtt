00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 I greet all who looked at the light in 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.790
 This video will show you how to impose 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.220
 music 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.429
 trim it off make increase descending 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.920
 in the program proshow producer at me 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.619
 small video clip prepared 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.100
 He is just three shots in it 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.359
 initial saver itself 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.699
 content and final zastavochku here if 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.460
 look on the scale then its time 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.640
 only makes up a little more 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.130
 minutes 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.300
 song that she picked up almost 4 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.890
 minutes to add music to 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:48.559
 video go to the music sound tab 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.559
 plus track add sound track 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.539
 choose the music you want to add 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.699
 but as we see we have a lot of excess 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.170
 in order to trim and correct and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.850
 as required but that was all beautiful 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.850
 go here increase the decrease in sound 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.880
 top slider on the right 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.140
 pull until then to trim here 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 we video a little more than a minute here 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.009
 can I put it for a moment 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.280
 I leave here on the scale 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.900
 where is one minute to make a slide 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.790
 sound at the end of the bottom slider pull on 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.700
 a certain distance on what we want 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 so that the decline has begun also 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.570
 do increase on the left side 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:50.479
 bottom slider pull where we want 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:55.409
 such here this number is necessary now 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:02:00.740
 remember 10 and 4 okay and also her 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.740
 duplicate here 10 and 4 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.100
 that is, where the scale is written down 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.610
 if that does not make a drop in 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.960
 the end 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.020
 I will not hear now let's see what 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.600
 get on the scale we immediately saw yes 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 what we have here 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.060
 the sound growth of the decrease is gone 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.910
 sound 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.710
 if anyone 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.710
 didn't pay attention it's here she 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:34.000
 on the scale you can see everything now 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.120
 check the clip itself 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.120
 so I'm more interested in something 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 the ending 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.290
 checking 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:00.709
 but it's ok on diminishing sound passed 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.709
 great very smoothly you all learned 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.940
 how to properly and quickly impose a sound and 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.799

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.360
