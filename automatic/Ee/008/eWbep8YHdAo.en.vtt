00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
we did is we put a we put a gobo inside

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.770 
we did is we put a we put a gobo inside
inside<00:00:31.130> of<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.430> fixture<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.000> then<00:00:32.480> we<00:00:32.539> put<00:00:32.719> it

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
inside of the fixture and then we put it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.810 
inside of the fixture and then we put it
up<00:00:32.809> against<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:33.140> wall<00:00:33.520> I'll<00:00:34.520> show<00:00:34.670> you<00:00:34.760> how

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
against the wall there and we created a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.040 
against the wall there and we created a
moving<00:00:43.670> texture<00:00:44.059> effect<00:00:44.149> now<00:00:44.540> again<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.899> can

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
moving texture effect now again you can

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.080 
moving texture effect now again you can
put<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:45.350> back<00:00:45.559> behind<00:00:45.739> head<00:00:46.040> tables<00:00:46.460> you're

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
put this back behind head tables you're

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.250 
put this back behind head tables you're
going<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.300> put<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:47.540> back<00:00:47.720> you<00:00:48.079> know<00:00:48.140> if<00:00:48.200> you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.590 
going to put it back you know if you
have<00:00:48.350> multiples<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:50.000> can<00:00:50.149> do<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.270> couple

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
have multiples on you can do a couple

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.160 
have multiples on you can do a couple
different<00:00:50.690> options<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:52.600> by<00:00:53.600> putting<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.930> color

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
creating a different different angle of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.670 
creating a different different angle of
the<00:01:14.330> beam<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.720> how<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:14.930> being<00:01:15.049> used<00:01:15.170> and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
you're using it as a moving texture up

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.130 
you're using it as a moving texture up
LED<00:01:18.979> fixture<00:01:19.400> or<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:20.510> know<00:01:20.600> something<00:01:20.810> simple

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.410 
king with the fixture and i'll show you
exactly<00:01:28.520> what<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:29.000> is<00:01:30.340> Mazel<00:01:31.340> Tov<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.180> the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
exactly what it is Mazel Tov that is the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.260 
exactly what it is Mazel Tov that is the
gobo<00:01:33.040> that<00:01:34.040> we're<00:01:34.220> using<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.790> create<00:01:34.970> that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
gobo that we're using to create that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.890 
gobo that we're using to create that
little<00:01:35.659> effect<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:37.150> you<00:01:38.150> know<00:01:38.270> there<00:01:38.420> are<00:01:38.600> some

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
little effect so you know there are some

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.539 
little effect so you know there are some
break<00:01:39.140> up<00:01:39.320> patterns<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:39.979> work<00:01:40.159> great<00:01:40.520> for

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
break up patterns that work great for

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.940 
break up patterns that work great for
this<00:01:40.880> type<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.090> effect<00:01:41.509> but<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.740> show<00:01:42.920> you

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
this type of effect but just to show you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.840 
this type of effect but just to show you
by<00:01:43.790> using<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.240> simple<00:01:44.509> Mazel<00:01:45.049> Tov<00:01:45.259> gobo<00:01:45.950> we<00:01:46.670> can

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
by using a simple Mazel Tov gobo we can

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.950 
by using a simple Mazel Tov gobo we can
create<00:01:47.150> it<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.540> use<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:47.930> different<00:01:49.720> style<00:01:50.720> of

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
create it and use a different style of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.840 
create it and use a different style of
light<00:01:51.200> by<00:01:51.590> putting<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:51.979> behind<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.280> head<00:01:52.430> table

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
light by putting it behind a head table

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.830 
light by putting it behind a head table
or<00:01:53.390> maybe<00:01:53.600> putting<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:55.180> putting<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.659> an

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
or maybe putting it putting that as an

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.870 
or maybe putting it putting that as an
entrance<00:01:57.259> area<00:01:57.409> what<00:01:58.130> guests<00:01:58.369> are<00:01:58.460> coming<00:01:58.579> in
