nice and it's this really nice blue
light<00:00:20.720> but<00:00:23.390> what<00:00:24.390> happened<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.820> contrary

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
light but what happened is that contrary

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.400 
light but what happened is that contrary
to<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.869> expected<00:00:28.609> this<00:00:29.609> used<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
to what I expected this used a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.310 
to what I expected this used a
fluorescent<00:00:31.410> light<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.969> after<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.870> month<00:00:33.960> or

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
fluorescent light that after a month or

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.740 
fluorescent light that after a month or
so<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.829> being<00:00:35.329> continually<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.829> burnt<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
so of being continually on burnt and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.770 
so of being continually on burnt and
unfortunately<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> comes<00:00:40.170> from<00:00:40.350> China<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
unfortunately this comes from China and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.950 
unfortunately this comes from China and
the<00:00:42.780> fluorescent<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> has<00:00:43.829> no

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
the fluorescent to you has no

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.979 
the fluorescent to you has no
indications<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.090> what<00:00:48.090> type<00:00:48.450> what

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
indications of what it is what type what

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.920 
indications of what it is what type what
size<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.890> anything<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> also<00:00:51.570> its

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
size or anything and also its

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
size or anything and also its
fluorescent<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.039> don't<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
fluorescent and I don't like it so I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.790 
fluorescent and I don't like it so I
decided<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.890> convert<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.730> bat<00:00:57.329> signal<00:00:57.800> into

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
decided to convert this bat signal into

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
decided to convert this bat signal into
an<00:00:59.129> RGB<00:00:59.870> bat<00:01:00.870> signal<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.789> not

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
an RGB bat signal as you can see and not

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.940 
an RGB bat signal as you can see and not
only<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.140> RGB<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> also<00:01:06.590> remote<00:01:07.590> control

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
only it is RGB it is also remote control

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.929 
only it is RGB it is also remote control
and<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> pretty<00:01:09.600> cool<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.049> took<00:01:10.939> roughly

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and this is pretty cool and took roughly

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.080 
and this is pretty cool and took roughly
15<00:01:12.570> minutes<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.430> was<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.760> was

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
15 minutes and that was because I was

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.570 
15 minutes and that was because I was
pretty<00:01:15.390> slow<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> lazy<00:01:15.950> when<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> did<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
pretty slow and lazy when I did is I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.200 
pretty slow and lazy when I did is I
bought<00:01:17.900> this<00:01:19.220> just<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> roll<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:22.100> RGB<00:01:23.100> LEDs<00:01:23.549> that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
bought this just a roll of RGB LEDs that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.340 
bought this just a roll of RGB LEDs that
came<00:01:25.220> with<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> controller<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
came with the controller and with a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.260 
came with the controller and with a
small<00:01:29.040> box<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:30.409> controls<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> LEDs<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
small box that controls the LEDs and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.670 
small box that controls the LEDs and
well<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> contents<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.049> small<00:01:34.259> box<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
well the contents of this small box I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.520 
well the contents of this small box I
basically<00:01:35.090> took<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> apart<00:01:36.450> stuck<00:01:37.380> them

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
basically took it apart stuck them

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.899 
basically took it apart stuck them
inside<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:39.740> that's<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.950> basically<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.700> stuck

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
inside and that's it basically you stuck

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.719 
inside and that's it basically you stuck
them<00:01:42.030> inside<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.740> end<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.100> made<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
them inside on one on one end I made the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.420 
them inside on one on one end I made the
infrared<00:01:45.720> receiver<00:01:46.020> protrude<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
infrared receiver protrude and on the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.789 
infrared receiver protrude and on the
other<00:01:47.549> end<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.270> made<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.320> power<00:01:49.500> connector

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
other end I made the power connector

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.030 
other end I made the power connector
protrude<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.460> cut<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.880> piece<00:01:54.180> of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
protrude and and I just cut a piece of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.999 
protrude and and I just cut a piece of
the<00:01:56.719> LEDs<00:01:57.719> raw<00:01:58.590> and<00:02:00.380> that's<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.829> very

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the LEDs raw and that's that it's very

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.420 
the LEDs raw and that's that it's very
bright<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.090> set<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.990> whatever

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
bright and I can set it to whatever

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.540 
bright and I can set it to whatever
color<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:06.439> so

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.360 

so<00:02:09.850> this<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.540> really<00:02:11.020> cool<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.890> also<00:02:12.010> turn<00:02:12.250> it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
so this is really cool it also turn it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.960 
so this is really cool it also turn it
off<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.250> yeah<00:02:16.060> I'll<00:02:17.050> turn<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.320> back<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.500> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.750 

yeah<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.240> has<00:02:22.990> some<00:02:23.140> animation<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.550> make

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
yeah and has some animation I can make

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.200 
yeah and has some animation I can make
my<00:02:24.910> own<00:02:24.940> animations<00:02:25.570> they<00:02:25.690> want<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.790> I'm<00:02:27.970> quite

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
my own animations they want so I'm quite

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.150 
my own animations they want so I'm quite
pleased<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.800> much<00:02:29.980> better

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
pleased with this this is much better

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.220 
pleased with this this is much better
than<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.610> original<00:02:33.780> fluorescent<00:02:34.780> tube<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
than the original fluorescent tube I

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.320 
than the original fluorescent tube I
basically<00:02:36.010> removed<00:02:36.520> all<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> fluorescent

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
basically removed all the fluorescent

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.400 
basically removed all the fluorescent
parts<00:02:37.600> from<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.520> has<00:02:39.520> some<00:02:39.700> sort<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.410> terrible

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
parts from it has some sort of terrible

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.360 
parts from it has some sort of terrible
Chinese<00:02:42.340> manufacturing<00:02:42.880> thing<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:44.370> that's

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
Chinese manufacturing thing and that's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.720 
Chinese manufacturing thing and that's
it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.670 
it
so<00:02:46.210> now<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.660> an<00:02:46.990> RGB<00:02:47.520> remote<00:02:48.520> controlled

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
so now I have an RGB remote controlled

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.400 
so now I have an RGB remote controlled
luminous<00:02:50.820> bat-signal<00:02:51.870> which<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.110> pretty

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
luminous bat-signal which is pretty

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.780 
luminous bat-signal which is pretty
amazing<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.010> which<00:02:54.820> in<00:02:55.060> my<00:02:55.960> case<00:02:55.990> helps<00:02:56.830> me<00:02:56.980> do
