00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.100 

yeah<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.850> other<00:05:34.030> views<00:05:34.300> on<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.690> way<00:05:34.810> care

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
yeah the other views on the way care

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.710 
yeah the other views on the way care
about<00:05:35.350> was<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.590> Maya<00:05:35.950> my<00:05:36.400> manager<00:05:36.820> suggested

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
about was that Maya my manager suggested

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.410 
about was that Maya my manager suggested
that<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:37.980> possibly<00:05:38.980> do<00:05:39.100> a<00:05:39.130> cover<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.580> song<00:05:39.820> and

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
that I possibly do a cover the song and

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.760 
that I possibly do a cover the song and
you<00:05:40.450> know<00:05:40.660> even<00:05:40.870> in<00:05:41.110> a<00:05:41.350> different<00:05:41.530> language

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
you know even in a different language

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.700 
you know even in a different language
that<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.420> chorus<00:05:43.420> and<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.720> melody<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.350> the

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
that the chorus and the melody and the

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.610 
that the chorus and the melody and the
hook<00:05:44.950> in<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.130> course<00:05:45.400> really<00:05:45.700> came<00:05:45.970> through

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
hook in the course really came through

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.590 
hook in the course really came through
and<00:05:47.620> I<00:05:47.680> think<00:05:47.890> the<00:05:48.010> sentiment<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.670> of<00:05:49.420> what

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
and I think the sentiment of the of what

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.180 
and I think the sentiment of the of what
the<00:05:49.690> song<00:05:49.840> is<00:05:49.870> about<00:05:50.020> kind<00:05:50.440> of<00:05:50.470> transcends<00:05:51.010> any

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
the song is about kind of transcends any

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.190 
the song is about kind of transcends any
language<00:05:51.550> barrier<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.630> was<00:05:52.750> kind<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.050> keen

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
language barrier so I was kind of keen

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.690 
language barrier so I was kind of keen
to<00:05:53.350> see<00:05:53.500> if<00:05:53.590> I<00:05:53.710> could<00:05:53.860> put<00:05:54.040> my<00:05:54.160> own<00:05:54.220> stamp<00:05:54.340> on<00:05:54.670> it

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
to see if I could put my own stamp on it

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.690 
to see if I could put my own stamp on it
so<00:05:55.030> we<00:05:55.720> didn't<00:05:56.230> English<00:05:56.440> translation<00:05:57.070> when<00:05:57.550> to

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
so we didn't English translation when to

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.420 
so we didn't English translation when to
the<00:05:57.760> studio<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.510> kind<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.900> put<00:05:59.110> my<00:05:59.800> mark<00:06:00.100> on<00:06:00.280> it

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
the studio and kind of put my mark on it

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.430 
the studio and kind of put my mark on it
made<00:06:00.700> it<00:06:00.820> sound<00:06:01.000> like<00:06:01.210> a<00:06:01.270> Stewart<00:06:01.810> Mac<00:06:01.990> version

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
made it sound like a Stewart Mac version

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.740 
made it sound like a Stewart Mac version
of<00:06:02.560> this<00:06:02.680> song<00:06:02.950> and<00:06:03.460> yeah<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.120> hopefully<00:06:04.240> it

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
of this song and yeah and hopefully it

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.630 
of this song and yeah and hopefully it
kind<00:06:05.020> of<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.650> has<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.830> same<00:06:06.070> impact<00:06:06.250> in

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
kind of it has the same impact in

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.920 
kind of it has the same impact in
English

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
