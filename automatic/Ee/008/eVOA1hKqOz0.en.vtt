so now if I go and I click this button
it's<00:04:31.939> actually<00:04:32.330> going<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.509> play<00:04:32.719> a<00:04:32.749> short

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
it's actually going to play a short

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.679 
it's actually going to play a short
little<00:04:33.400> clip<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.669> technique<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:35.389> right

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:35.689 
little clip of the technique so right

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.269 
little clip of the technique so right
here<00:04:35.870> we're<00:04:36.020> learning<00:04:36.139> techniques<00:04:36.740> then<00:04:37.189> it

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:37.279 
here we're learning techniques then it

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.529 
here we're learning techniques then it
gets<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:37.639> part<00:04:37.939> it's<00:04:38.120> actually<00:04:38.360> going<00:04:38.449> to

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
gets to this part it's actually going to

gets to this part it's actually going to
show<00:04:38.719> you<00:04:38.779> the<00:04:39.020> technique<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:39.650> check<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:39.919> out

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
show you the technique so check it out

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.019 
show you the technique so check it out
hit<00:04:40.969> play<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.949> loads<00:04:43.159> really<00:04:43.460> quick<00:04:43.669> they

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:44.029 
hit play it loads really quick they

hit play it loads really quick they
usually<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.659> a<00:04:44.960> couple<00:04:45.620> second<00:04:46.099> clips<00:04:46.370> okay

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
usually like a couple second clips okay

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.080 
usually like a couple second clips okay
and<00:04:48.080> then<00:04:49.069> you<00:04:49.279> know<00:04:49.310> that's<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.759> whole<00:04:49.909> move

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
and then you know that's the whole move

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.209 
which i think is really cool so they're
kind<00:05:13.639> of<00:05:13.729> taking<00:05:14.120> it<00:05:14.210> above<00:05:14.569> and<00:05:14.900> beyond<00:05:15.680> just

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
kind of taking it above and beyond just

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.619 
kind of taking it above and beyond just
sort<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.639> a<00:05:17.139> digital<00:05:18.370> PDF<00:05:19.370> or<00:05:19.909> something<00:05:20.300> okay

well<00:05:26.689> the<00:05:26.990> ability<00:05:27.349> to<00:05:27.499> watch<00:05:27.680> technique

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
well the ability to watch technique

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.390 
well the ability to watch technique
videos<00:05:28.669> within<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.750> app<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:30.740> me<00:05:31.009> is<00:05:31.129> kind<00:05:31.279> of

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
here but then I sometimes need to

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.990 
here but then I sometimes need to
actually<00:07:18.259> see<00:07:18.770> it<00:07:18.889> all<00:07:18.979> together<00:07:19.279> and<00:07:19.580> make<00:07:19.969> it

actually see it all together and make it

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.510 
actually see it all together and make it
happen<00:07:20.439> for<00:07:21.439> me<00:07:21.620> to<00:07:21.800> personally<00:07:22.009> learn

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
happen for me to personally learn

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.700 
happen for me to personally learn
everybody<00:07:23.150> learns<00:07:23.330> differently<00:07:23.599> but<00:07:24.349> I<00:07:24.409> think

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
everybody learns differently but I think

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.890 
everybody learns differently but I think
they<00:07:24.860> do<00:07:24.919> a<00:07:25.009> good<00:07:25.279> job<00:07:25.340> of<00:07:25.849> having<00:07:26.599> a

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
they do a good job of having a

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.010 
they do a good job of having a
description<00:07:27.439> of<00:07:27.830> the<00:07:28.159> technique<00:07:28.719> and<00:07:29.719> then

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
description of the technique and then

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.480 
description of the technique and then
pictures<00:07:30.560> of<00:07:30.680> the<00:07:30.770> technique<00:07:31.129> and<00:07:31.339> then<00:07:31.460> a

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
pictures of the technique and then a
