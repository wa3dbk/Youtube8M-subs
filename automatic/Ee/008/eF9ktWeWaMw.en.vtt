it you see the earth that is continent
but<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:53.000> store<00:01:53.830> this<00:01:54.830> is<00:01:55.039> as<00:01:55.190> important<00:01:55.670> as

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
but in store this is as important as

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.210 
but in store this is as important as
that<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.750> keeps<00:01:56.899> butter<00:01:57.259> cool<00:01:57.590> when<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:57.979> look

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
that it keeps butter cool when I look

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.040 
that it keeps butter cool when I look
across<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.729> pond<00:01:58.940> from<00:01:59.179> this<00:01:59.420> Pete<00:01:59.720> toward

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
across the pond from this Pete toward

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.380 
across the pond from this Pete toward
the<00:02:00.200> Sudbury<00:02:00.619> Meadows<00:02:01.070> which<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:01.880> time<00:02:02.090> of

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
the Sudbury Meadows which in time of

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.570 
the Sudbury Meadows which in time of
flood<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:02.869> distinguished<00:02:03.440> elevated<00:02:04.190> perhaps

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
flood I distinguished elevated perhaps

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.580 
flood I distinguished elevated perhaps
by<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:04.880> mirage<00:02:05.300> in<00:02:05.690> their<00:02:05.869> seething<00:02:06.319> valley

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
by a mirage in their seething valley

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.370 
by a mirage in their seething valley
like<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.280> corn<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.850> amazing<00:02:08.360> all<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.229> earth

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
like a corn and amazing all the earth

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.080 
like a corn and amazing all the earth
beyond<00:02:09.799> the<00:02:09.950> pond<00:02:10.130> appeared<00:02:10.610> like<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.790> thin

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
beyond the pond appeared like a thin

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.569 
beyond the pond appeared like a thin
crust<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:11.989> did<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.440> floated<00:02:12.980> even<00:02:13.459> by

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
crust and so I did and floated even by

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.060 
crust and so I did and floated even by
the<00:02:13.640> small<00:02:14.030> sheet<00:02:14.329> of<00:02:14.480> inverting<00:02:15.019> water<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.680> I

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
the small sheet of inverting water and I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.250 
the small sheet of inverting water and I
was<00:02:16.250> reminded<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.820> this<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.510> which<00:02:17.750> i<00:02:17.959> dwelt

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
was reminded that this and which i dwelt

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.310 
was reminded that this and which i dwelt
was<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:18.799> dry<00:02:19.040> land
