00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
just over from 9-1 i think is the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
just over from 9-1 i think is the
Koreans<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.880> don't<00:00:36.059> remember<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.750> well<00:00:36.930> dig<00:00:37.140> me

I think we just pretty much holdem and
yeah<00:00:41.399> against<00:00:41.910> mouse<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.809> was<00:00:43.020> off<00:00:43.200> stream
