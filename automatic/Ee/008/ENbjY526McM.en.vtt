one more video today I have made a lot
of<00:00:08.760> progress<00:00:09.059> over<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:10.110> last<00:00:10.460> 10<00:00:11.460> hours<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.820> so

fully<00:00:12.990> completely<00:00:13.410> mounted<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.099> intercooler

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
fully completely mounted the intercooler

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.310 
fully completely mounted the intercooler
had<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.790> drop<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.210> way<00:00:15.570> down<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:16.080> another

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
had to drop it way down about another

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.279 
had to drop it way down about another
three<00:00:16.890> inches<00:00:17.220> from<00:00:17.369> where<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> had<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> before

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
three inches from where I had it before

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.340 
three inches from where I had it before
then<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.410> cooler<00:00:20.330> bolted<00:00:21.330> strapped<00:00:21.779> down<00:00:22.020> there

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
then a cooler bolted strapped down there

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.300 
then a cooler bolted strapped down there
and<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> underside<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:24.119> I've<00:00:24.689> also<00:00:24.840> got

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
and on the underside here I've also got

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.910 
and on the underside here I've also got
some<00:00:26.390> some<00:00:27.390> nice<00:00:27.630> fabricated<00:00:28.289> TIG<00:00:28.740> weld

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
some some nice fabricated TIG weld

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.470 
some some nice fabricated TIG weld
brackets<00:00:29.480> that<00:00:31.460> keep<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.640> plate<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.210> place

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
brackets that keep that plate in place

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.130 
brackets that keep that plate in place
with<00:00:34.200> zero<00:00:34.410> movement<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.340> mean<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.329> barely

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
with zero movement I mean just barely

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.130 
with zero movement I mean just barely
anything<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.710> all<00:00:38.510> I've<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> cold<00:00:39.960> side

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
anything at all I've got the cold side

anything at all I've got the cold side
piping<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:41.070> over<00:00:41.750> now<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.170> where<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.379> got

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
piping all over now this is where it got

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.490 
piping all over now this is where it got
tricky<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.430> did<00:00:44.640> not<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.090> came<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.200> where

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
tricky it did not this came out where

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
tricky it did not this came out where
I've<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> intercooler<00:00:47.070> mounted<00:00:47.520> where

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I've got the intercooler mounted where

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
I've got the intercooler mounted where
it<00:00:47.940> worked<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.239> everything<00:00:48.539> else<00:00:48.739> this<00:00:49.739> Bend

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it worked with everything else this Bend

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.580 
it worked with everything else this Bend
right<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:50.879> bit<00:00:50.969> too<00:00:51.210> long

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
right here is a little bit too long

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.170 
right here is a little bit too long
coming<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.399> had<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> take<00:00:54.030> off

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
coming out so I just I had to take off

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020 
coming out so I just I had to take off
about<00:00:54.379> almost<00:00:55.379> 2<00:00:55.530> inches<00:00:55.559> shorten<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
about almost 2 inches shorten this this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
about almost 2 inches shorten this this
length<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.600> two<00:00:57.809> inches<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.010> stuck

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
length here two inches because it stuck

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
length here two inches because it stuck
out<00:00:59.370> too<00:00:59.579> far<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.969> too<00:01:00.719> far<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.079> way<00:01:01.140> here

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
out too far this too far this way here

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.609 
out too far this too far this way here
so<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.239> shortened<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.870> brought<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> up

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
so I shortened that then I brought it up

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
so I shortened that then I brought it up
but<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.960> piece<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:08.670> piece<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.090> up

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
but then this piece this piece going up

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.570 
but then this piece this piece going up
here<00:01:09.420> had<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> lot<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> problems<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.229> well

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
here had a lot of problems as well

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.950 
here had a lot of problems as well
fitting<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.760> quite<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.330> didn't<00:01:12.600> tangles

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
fitting just quite right didn't tangles

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.179 
fitting just quite right didn't tangles
Justin<00:01:13.229> quite<00:01:13.409> work<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> ended<00:01:14.130> up

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
Justin quite work so what I ended up

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.600 
Justin quite work so what I ended up
doing<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.330> solid<00:01:15.689> piece<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
doing this was one solid piece here I

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.450 
doing this was one solid piece here I
sectioned<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.979> right<00:01:20.130> now<00:01:20.250> I've<00:01:20.369> got

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
sectioned this and right now I've got

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.030 
sectioned this and right now I've got
attacked<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.150> all<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.900> rotate<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
attacked I all I had to do was rotate it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130 
attacked I all I had to do was rotate it
to<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> angles<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.970> looking<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.450> I've

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to get the angles I was looking for I've

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.359 
to get the angles I was looking for I've
got<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> perfect<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> throttle

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
got a perfect right up to the throttle

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
got a perfect right up to the throttle
body<00:01:26.520> got<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.000> mocked<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.689> that's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
body got that mocked up there that's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
body got that mocked up there that's
bolted<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:29.000> it'll<00:01:30.000> come<00:01:30.119> off<00:01:30.210> again<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.659> for

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
bolted down it'll come off again but for

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.660 
bolted down it'll come off again but for
now<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> worked<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:32.159> perfect<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.640> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
now it worked so that's perfect out of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.340 
now it worked so that's perfect out of
their<00:01:32.909> perfect<00:01:33.360> into<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.689> perfect<00:01:34.049> into

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
their perfect into this perfect into

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
their perfect into this perfect into
that<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.250> I've<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> tacked<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.600> had

that and I've got that tacked I just had

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.789 
that and I've got that tacked I just had
to<00:01:36.780> twist<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> put<00:01:37.710> about

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
to twist it just had to put about

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
to twist it just had to put about
another<00:01:38.100> 30<00:01:38.369> degrees<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.880> 40<00:01:39.240> degrees<00:01:39.509> or

glad to have some fabricating skills
this<00:01:46.500> kid<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> still<00:01:47.130> sweet<00:01:47.430> kid<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:47.700> there's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
this kid is still sweet kid but there's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.109 
this kid is still sweet kid but there's
a<00:01:48.030> couple<00:01:48.270> things<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> weren't<00:01:48.750> exactly

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
a couple things that weren't exactly

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.780 
a couple things that weren't exactly
least<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.299> my<00:01:51.329> install<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.340> as<00:01:53.340> perfect<00:01:53.729> as

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
least on my install just as perfect as

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.810 
least on my install just as perfect as
pie<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.360> I've<00:01:54.720> had<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> cut<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.920> wear<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
pie so I've had to cut that and wear it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.459 
pie so I've had to cut that and wear it
also<00:01:57.149> got<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.869> interesting<00:01:58.350> was

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
also got a little bit interesting was

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.050 
also got a little bit interesting was
down<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> seam

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
down here you can see this is a seam

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.730 
down here you can see this is a seam
that<00:02:00.090> normally<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> butting<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.229> against<00:02:01.619> in

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that normally be butting up against in

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.859 
that normally be butting up against in
here<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> other<00:02:02.490> pipe<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> actually

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
here on the other pipe this is actually

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
here on the other pipe this is actually
the<00:02:03.960> end<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> old<00:02:04.350> pipe<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.340> piece<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.790> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the end of the old pipe the piece that I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
the end of the old pipe the piece that I
were<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.240> or<00:02:06.270> cut<00:02:06.750> off<00:02:06.869> from<00:02:06.990> over<00:02:07.170> here

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
were you or cut off from over here

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.609 
were you or cut off from over here
I<00:02:07.649> had<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> lengthen<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.310> pipe<00:02:08.840> by<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.989> by

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
I had to lengthen this pipe by that by

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.770 
I had to lengthen this pipe by that by
that<00:02:10.739> mount<00:02:10.979> exactly<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.300> able<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.540> put

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
that mount exactly so I was able to put

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.190 
that mount exactly so I was able to put
that<00:02:12.930> in

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that in

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.160 
that in
that<00:02:13.379> there<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.330> that's<00:02:15.540> I've<00:02:15.930> already

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that there so that's I've already

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.600 
that there so that's I've already
pressure<00:02:16.349> tested<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.129> 20<00:02:17.370> psi

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
pressure tested that to 20 psi

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.509 
pressure tested that to 20 psi
completely<00:02:18.569> leak<00:02:18.780> free<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:20.280> piece

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
completely leak free and this piece

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.400 
completely leak free and this piece
extends<00:02:21.030> halfway<00:02:21.390> under<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.690> clamp<00:02:21.989> now<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
extends halfway under this clamp now so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.770 
extends halfway under this clamp now so
I'd<00:02:22.530> lengthen<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:23.819> obviously<00:02:24.000> so

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
I'd lengthen this and then obviously so

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.270 
I'd lengthen this and then obviously so
I've<00:02:24.840> cut<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.319> this<00:02:25.500> was<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:25.860> one<00:02:26.069> piece

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
I've cut this this was all one piece

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.300 
I've cut this this was all one piece
here<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.670> from<00:02:26.940> right<00:02:27.120> here<00:02:28.010> down<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.220> here

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
here this from right here down to here

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.460 
here this from right here down to here
so<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.849> added<00:02:30.269> a<00:02:30.330> piece<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.170> cut

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
so I added a piece on to it and then cut

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.820 
so I added a piece on to it and then cut
it<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.680> twisted<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:34.380> makes<00:02:34.590> them

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
it and twisted it and that makes them

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.620 
it and twisted it and that makes them
works<00:02:35.340> perfectly<00:02:35.760> there's<00:02:35.970> no<00:02:36.060> stress<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.599> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
works perfectly there's no stress on it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.420 
works perfectly there's no stress on it
it<00:02:37.470> drops<00:02:37.709> right<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.069> there

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it drops right in there

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430 
it drops right in there
it<00:02:38.849> goes<00:02:39.030> into<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.330> cooler<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.780> clearance<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it goes into that cooler I clearance the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.289 
it goes into that cooler I clearance the
fog<00:02:40.650> light<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.190> took<00:02:41.370> my<00:02:41.489> plasma<00:02:41.849> cutter<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
fog light here took my plasma cutter and

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.210 
fog light here took my plasma cutter and
sliced<00:02:43.019> off<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.410> bit<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.620> big<00:02:43.799> bracket

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
sliced off a little bit this big bracket

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.440 
sliced off a little bit this big bracket
just<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.610> cleared<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.269> turned

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
just so that cleared that as it turned

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.870 
just so that cleared that as it turned
the<00:02:45.480> corner<00:02:46.640> how<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.700> test<00:02:48.239> fit<00:02:48.569> my<00:02:49.880> radiator

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the corner how to test fit my radiator

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.580 
the corner how to test fit my radiator
I've<00:02:51.209> already<00:02:51.450> test<00:02:51.690> fitted<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.079> front<00:02:52.319> cover

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
I've already test fitted the front cover

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.410 
I've already test fitted the front cover
I<00:02:52.829> know<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.280> works<00:02:53.489> with<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> intercooler<00:02:54.090> so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
I know it works with the intercooler so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.190 
I know it works with the intercooler so
that's<00:02:54.569> perfect

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
that's perfect

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.150 
that's perfect
had<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:55.890> earlier<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.410> that's<00:02:58.590> good<00:02:59.010> news

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
had that on earlier so that's good news

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.460 
had that on earlier so that's good news
the<00:02:59.400> intercooler<00:02:59.940> is<00:02:59.970> completely<00:03:00.420> done<00:03:00.630> what

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the intercooler is completely done what

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.500 
the intercooler is completely done what
I<00:03:01.500> did<00:03:01.829> do<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.390> test<00:03:03.390> fit<00:03:03.660> my<00:03:03.930> radiator<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:05.510> my

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
I did do is test fit my radiator and my

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.660 
I did do is test fit my radiator and my
shroud<00:03:06.989> has<00:03:07.410> shroud<00:03:07.650> how<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.829> be<00:03:07.980> modified<00:03:08.430> and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
shroud has shroud how to be modified and

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.880 
shroud has shroud how to be modified and
I<00:03:09.239> have<00:03:09.390> taken<00:03:09.720> my<00:03:09.840> stock<00:03:10.110> shroud<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:10.829> you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
I have taken my stock shroud here as you

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.280 
I have taken my stock shroud here as you
can<00:03:10.920> see<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.310> I've<00:03:11.370> put<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:12.120> sixteenth<00:03:12.900> fan

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
can see and I've put in a sixteenth fan

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.339 
can see and I've put in a sixteenth fan
that<00:03:13.500> came<00:03:13.680> out<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.790> was<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> ninety<00:03:15.510> four

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
that came out of a it was a ninety four

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.830 
that came out of a it was a ninety four
or<00:03:16.500> five<00:03:16.709> Mustang<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.220> believe<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.489> was<00:03:17.609> but<00:03:18.510> you

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
or five Mustang I believe it was but you

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.960 
or five Mustang I believe it was but you
can<00:03:19.200> see<00:03:19.350> my<00:03:19.470> water<00:03:19.680> pump<00:03:19.889> pulley<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.430> right

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
can see my water pump pulley is right

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.759 
can see my water pump pulley is right
this<00:03:21.359> out<00:03:21.510> was<00:03:21.660> before<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.200> I'm<00:03:22.319> used<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
this out was before so I'm used to it

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.289 
this out was before so I'm used to it
but<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:22.920> mean<00:03:23.100> there<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.280> no<00:03:23.730> clearance<00:03:24.090> between

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
but I mean there is no clearance between

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.580 
but I mean there is no clearance between
them<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:24.750> don't<00:03:24.870> hurt<00:03:25.019> each<00:03:25.139> other<00:03:25.380> they

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
them and they don't hurt each other they

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.170 
them and they don't hurt each other they
never<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.370> plastic<00:03:26.880> if<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.030> did

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
never have is this plastic if it did

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.750 
never have is this plastic if it did
touch<00:03:27.359> it's<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.500> motor<00:03:28.739> still<00:03:29.040> half<00:03:29.519> inch

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
touch it's the motor still half inch

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.309 
touch it's the motor still half inch
underneath<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.209> plastic<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.139> kind

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
underneath that plastic so it just kind

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.750 
underneath that plastic so it just kind
of<00:03:31.350> scuffs<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.709> plastic<00:03:32.100> anything<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:32.609> there

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
of scuffs the plastic anything but there

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.030 
of scuffs the plastic anything but there
is<00:03:32.850> zero<00:03:33.090> clearance<00:03:33.450> there<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.709> fan

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
is zero clearance there but that fan

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.240 
is zero clearance there but that fan
keeps<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.239> thing<00:03:36.299> plenty<00:03:36.959> cool<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.709> found<00:03:38.100> out

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
keeps this thing plenty cool I found out

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.979 
keeps this thing plenty cool I found out
sixty<00:03:38.639> ant<00:03:38.790> fan<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.750> I've<00:03:39.840> got

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
sixty ant fan that I've got

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.599 
sixty ant fan that I've got
thermostatically<00:03:40.680> controlled<00:03:40.709> thermostat

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
thermostatically controlled thermostat

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.620 
thermostatically controlled thermostat
probe<00:03:42.239> right<00:03:42.420> there<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:43.109> goes<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> relay

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
probe right there that goes to a relay

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.819 
probe right there that goes to a relay
which<00:03:45.630> then<00:03:45.840> goes<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.139> thermostatic<00:03:46.739> switch

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
which then goes to a thermostatic switch

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.860 
which then goes to a thermostatic switch
and<00:03:47.700> I've<00:03:47.819> got<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.030> relay<00:03:48.299> wired<00:03:48.569> up<00:03:48.750> to

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
and I've got the relay wired up to

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.479 
and I've got the relay wired up to
handle<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.200> 60<00:03:49.470> amp<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:49.859> switch<00:03:50.130> doesn't<00:03:50.400> have

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
handle the 60 amp so switch doesn't have

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.740 
handle the 60 amp so switch doesn't have
to<00:03:50.549> do<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.579> fits<00:03:54.359> in<00:03:54.540> there

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
to do that but so that fits in there

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.690 
to do that but so that fits in there
everything's<00:03:55.319> looking<00:03:55.560> good<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.250> know<00:03:56.370> this

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
everything's looking good I know this

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.309 
everything's looking good I know this
will<00:03:56.819> work<00:03:56.880> I'm<00:03:57.329> stoked<00:03:57.840> about<00:03:57.959> that<00:04:00.319> one

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
will work I'm stoked about that one

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.110 
will work I'm stoked about that one
thing<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.590> also<00:04:01.739> did<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.250> clenched<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.790> just

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
thing I also did is I clenched it just

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.930 
thing I also did is I clenched it just
enough<00:04:03.450> as<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.139> can<00:04:04.380> see<00:04:04.620> down<00:04:04.829> there<00:04:05.190> you

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
enough as you can see down there you

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.699 
enough as you can see down there you
probably<00:04:06.569> Coley<00:04:06.900> Cal<00:04:07.139> there's<00:04:07.260> no<00:04:07.380> clearance

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
probably Coley Cal there's no clearance

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.190 
probably Coley Cal there's no clearance
to<00:04:07.799> front<00:04:08.069> pulley<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.549> has<00:04:08.760> about<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.780> belts

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
to front pulley it has about a belts

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440 
to front pulley it has about a belts
with<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.620> half<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:11.519> squeeze<00:04:11.940> through<00:04:12.120> there

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
with and a half to squeeze through there

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.479 
with and a half to squeeze through there
so<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.780> can<00:04:12.989> get<00:04:13.079> a<00:04:13.109> belt<00:04:13.319> around<00:04:13.590> there<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.280> I

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
so I can get a belt around there and I

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.400 
so I can get a belt around there and I
was<00:04:14.609> worried<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.959> would<00:04:16.109> move<00:04:16.260> and

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
was worried that that would move and

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.710 
was worried that that would move and
possibly<00:04:17.400> under<00:04:17.579> hard<00:04:17.760> load<00:04:17.970> or<00:04:18.180> breaking<00:04:18.599> or

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
possibly under hard load or breaking or

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.270 
possibly under hard load or breaking or
something<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.739> would<00:04:19.889> bouncing<00:04:20.220> at

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
something that that would bouncing at

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.110 
something that that would bouncing at
the<00:04:20.370> pulley<00:04:20.579> but<00:04:20.789> that's<00:04:20.910> never<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.390> case

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
the pulley but that's never the case

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.760 
the pulley but that's never the case
with<00:04:24.120> intercooler<00:04:24.599> mount<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.900> really<00:04:25.200> well<00:04:25.380> it

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
with intercooler mount of really well it

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.450 
with intercooler mount of really well it
does<00:04:26.130> not

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
does not

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.580 
does not
move<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:27.090> does<00:04:27.300> not<00:04:27.419> go<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:27.840> at<00:04:28.110> all<00:04:28.229> so

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
move it does not go to that at all so

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.590 
move it does not go to that at all so
I'm<00:04:28.889> good<00:04:29.160> they're<00:04:29.400> very<00:04:29.610> tight<00:04:30.060> tolerances

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
I'm good they're very tight tolerances

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.460 
I'm good they're very tight tolerances
oh<00:04:30.979> it's<00:04:31.979> in<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:33.449> cold<00:04:33.660> side<00:04:33.810> piping<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.289> gonna

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
oh it's in the cold side piping is gonna

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.659 
oh it's in the cold side piping is gonna
be<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.710> for<00:04:34.889> good<00:04:35.009> tonight

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
be in for good tonight

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.930 
be in for good tonight
I'm<00:04:37.069> let's<00:04:38.069> see<00:04:38.220> what<00:04:38.370> else<00:04:38.490> we've<00:04:38.699> done<00:04:38.819> here

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
I'm let's see what else we've done here

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.749 
I'm let's see what else we've done here
today<00:04:40.039> don't<00:04:41.039> know<00:04:41.190> that's<00:04:41.370> really<00:04:41.550> all<00:04:41.669> I've

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
today don't know that's really all I've

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.159 
today don't know that's really all I've
been<00:04:41.970> working<00:04:42.210> on<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.389> just<00:04:42.419> fabricating<00:04:43.050> that

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
been working on is just fabricating that

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:43.760 
been working on is just fabricating that
crap<00:04:43.380> up

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
crap up

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.070 
crap up
but<00:04:44.699> that's<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.300> for<00:04:45.449> now<00:04:45.539> I'll<00:04:45.750> probably<00:04:45.870> take

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
but that's it for now I'll probably take

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.320 
but that's it for now I'll probably take
a<00:04:46.110> video<00:04:46.289> once<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.740> get<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:46.949> fender<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.330> I've

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
a video once I get the fender on I've

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.360 
a video once I get the fender on I've
got<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.569> I've<00:04:48.960> got<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.380> used<00:04:49.710> fender<00:04:50.130> that's

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
got a I've got a used fender that's

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.249 
got a I've got a used fender that's
under<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.729> car<00:04:50.910> right<00:04:51.090> now<00:04:51.120> see<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.110> back

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
under the car right now see the back

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.629 
under the car right now see the back
half<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.710> there<00:04:52.860> but<00:04:52.979> that'll<00:04:53.130> be<00:04:53.160> going<00:04:53.340> on

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
half of it there but that'll be going on

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.350 
half of it there but that'll be going on
I<00:04:53.880> also<00:04:54.449> did<00:04:54.810> relocate<00:04:55.849> if<00:04:56.849> anybody<00:04:57.180> knows

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
I also did relocate if anybody knows

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.790 
I also did relocate if anybody knows
what<00:04:57.509> these<00:04:57.630> relays<00:04:57.930> are<00:04:58.139> I<00:04:58.380> just<00:04:58.590> didn't<00:04:58.740> look

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
what these relays are I just didn't look

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.710 
what these relays are I just didn't look
at<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:58.949> schematic<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.580> didn't<00:04:59.910> even<00:05:00.120> I'm<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:00.599> not

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
at a schematic I didn't even I'm a not

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.120 
at a schematic I didn't even I'm a not
even<00:05:00.900> need<00:05:01.110> them<00:05:01.199> for<00:05:01.410> everything<00:05:01.830> I've<00:05:01.919> taken

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
even need them for everything I've taken

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.860 
even need them for everything I've taken
out<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.520> but<00:05:02.669> I<00:05:02.849> just<00:05:03.090> read<00:05:03.419> these<00:05:03.570> used<00:05:03.780> to

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
out of it but I just read these used to

so<00:05:22.080> these<00:05:22.800> used<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.370> be<00:05:23.430> these<00:05:24.000> relays<00:05:24.360> right

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
so these used to be these relays right

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.170 
so these used to be these relays right
here<00:05:25.080> used<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.590> be<00:05:25.800> under<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.610> cold<00:05:26.819> under

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
here used to be under the cold under

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.700 
here used to be under the cold under

and then that other pigtail there is for
the<00:05:43.289> mass<00:05:44.009> air<00:05:44.190> sensor<00:05:44.490> which<00:05:44.639> I'll<00:05:44.759> no<00:05:44.909> longer

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
the mass air sensor which I'll no longer

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.420 
the mass air sensor which I'll no longer
be<00:05:45.330> using<00:05:45.620> because<00:05:46.620> we'll<00:05:46.919> be<00:05:47.009> using<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.280> map

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
be using because we'll be using the map

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.459 
be using because we'll be using the map
sensor<00:05:47.669> and<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.000> mega<00:05:48.180> squirt<00:05:48.419> setup<00:05:48.719> so

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
sensor and the mega squirt setup so

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.379 
sensor and the mega squirt setup so
anyway<00:05:50.780> it's<00:05:51.780> been<00:05:52.289> fun<00:05:52.729> long<00:05:53.729> day<00:05:53.909> of<00:05:53.940> cutting

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
anyway it's been fun long day of cutting

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.810 
anyway it's been fun long day of cutting
and<00:05:54.539> welding<00:05:54.659> and<00:05:55.020> grinding<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:56.430> it's<00:05:56.580> coming

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
and welding and grinding but it's coming

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.589 
and welding and grinding but it's coming
together<00:05:58.250> it's<00:05:59.250> always<00:05:59.550> so<00:05:59.849> close<00:06:00.270> with<00:06:00.479> this

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
together it's always so close with this

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.499 
together it's always so close with this
car<00:06:00.870> but<00:06:01.520> it<00:06:02.520> looks<00:06:02.699> pretty<00:06:02.849> packed<00:06:03.150> in<00:06:03.360> there

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509
