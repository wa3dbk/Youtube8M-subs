00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.490
 Circle tv and you did not notice anything today 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.420
 in the game oh yes today there was an update 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.190
 long-awaited that everyone was waiting for 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
 probably not me because the rebirth 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.379
 i don't play but anyway 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.260
 rebirth removed the checkbox cheers hurray now 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.150
 there will be real meilovo those who 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.400
 wants to be happy about it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.619
 I am glad that suddenly the schedule has changed 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.430
 perhaps I don’t know today 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 maximum 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.269
 and lilacs and these shaders 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.279
 this light reflected from the tanks 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.040
 corrected and became very beautiful on 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.380
 maximum settings are not much 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.750
 as bad as it used to be before 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 be less bullshit now it's all so 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.280
 reflected beautiful texture such 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.700
 the texture of the tank can be seen even for the browser 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.920
 games about the bomb itself became the graphics to me 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.199
 I really enjoyed it today so it is in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.829
 quiet horror just first stood not 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.140
 understood miraculously happening like this in a hangar 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.440
 considered tanchiki and so everything is beautiful 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 it turned out I really liked and 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.409
 probably the only thing I do not 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.040
 I liked the fact that I forgot to remove the effect 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.920
 from a shot at this after 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.330
 update again came out constantly sound 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.130
 reset to default settings 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.540
 graphics settings had all 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 twist forgot to change some 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.670
 options that sometimes disable the general 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 but the main thing is not the main thing is that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 Today we have another rubric measured 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.939
 or just generally well here zashib 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 What a fight and change to score in general 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.079
 especially oil they though there will always be those 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.600
 who can blame me i believe i 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.540
 I know, but now I quickly pound 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.250
 class which I got here and in 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.079
 in general, see what the city we have 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 push through opponents caught more 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.490
 less adequate to the mountain did not climb and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.759
 climbed into a city ​​like this one should have been 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.430
 would 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.560
 and occur in every battle on not always 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.210
 it happens and I unwind here two 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.829
 opponents of the sixth level which is to me 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.079
 especially can not do anything 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.320
 well, of course, object 701 machine 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.149
 cheater and so we kill these 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.790
 unfortunate 2 sixs are going to help 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.670
 allies who voila already merged here 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.700
 This is a turn I think I will have now 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.830
 not sweet and so the battle began not 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.840
 very good for 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.850
 me and for my allies i'm not at all 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.670
 I know how to call it got out and immediately 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.930
 got under the tracks and stood up 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.210
 wait for your 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.760
 Outcome Well, so about the update 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.370
 if you notice a change in the graph then 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.810
 in general, plus wild developers 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.850
 I noticed I really liked it 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.640
 maybe of course I have something there 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.230
 It was wrong but still it seemed to me 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 that something has changed especially that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.610
 corrected these reflections from tanks 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.470
 who led the last patch well right 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.090
 the eye is happy because the picture is on 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.880
 maximum settings looks well 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.700
 very very worthy for the browser game 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.070
 I as already said just bombs at or 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.720
 repit at me very much hope 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.820
 that it will also please you but 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.350
 the owner is not the most powerful yet 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.600
 principle I hope it does not affect in any way 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.580
 switched to performance here 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.470
 on gold to unwind this object 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.750
 because armor-piercing shells are 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.540
 difficult to break 180 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.090
 armor-piercing projectile and Golda and h300 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.680
 there are no problems here and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.370
 bottom armor plate quietly sewed this 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.560
 701 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.019
 so that I have a chance at least some 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.269
 drag but truth tell you a secret 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.310
 not something I have it before me were 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.590
 here of course and do not break through but still 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.470
 taken my armor and the back already 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.269
 arrived and the front is running out and yes 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.000
 the allies already had time to face 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.610
 unreal quickly turned on activated 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.100
 turbo drain mode but what do you have to do 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.580
 somehow play on my own now now 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.560
 fight with your third and with the wings 2 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.810
 + More opponents will arrive in 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.670
 anyway well do i have it here 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.739
 especially nothing remains except 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.930
 try to do anything 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.420
 we stayed at the base like 3 allies 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.050
 heaps can beat off en no wing 2 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.040
 died 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.480
 1 701 objects still remain there but m36 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.519
 understandably not the same 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.410
 especially the enemies do not hold with 3 apparently 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.930
 switched to gold and sews me too 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.730
 constantly for successfully so it falls into 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.580
 turret cafe does not act so 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.170
 successful as her ally but nothing to me 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.459
 it remains to do except as a petition 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.890
 try to target isa third 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.260
 who would need 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.060
 beat and then maybe I could at least 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.790
 something to do in this fight but of 3 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.400
 bovine defies his strong tower 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.230
 trying to shoot up turrets but shells 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.300
 fly the wrong way trying to 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.150
 thousand repel projectiles repel 2 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.430
 but is-3 to aim normally heals and 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.550
 punching remains me quite a bit 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.740
 hit points isa third unfortunately not 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.919
 how can I not target him like this 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.220
 dishes climbed over the corpse and there it did 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.010
 don't get it kill me with baku collecting then with 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.660
 base is our only 36 which 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.840
 even during the shoot does not know how to 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.400
 now you will see a super situation just 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.180
 comedian I laugh well with tears probably 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.160
 getting aim and beating ass not 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.020
 punches comes down comes down shoots not 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.000
 struck well done congratulate or you 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.310
 the winner in life and he himself shoots 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.870
 once again the caterpillars are absolutely beautiful 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.030
 the guy pulled 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.419
 I'm already here and hope stopped clear 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.640
 business well so if you noticed in the game 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.310
 something new then like this video 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.780
 if you like this turbo mode 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.090
 plum never do it anyway 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.810
 use only with your enemies so 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.660
 drain 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.100
 and I hope that you will never get to 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.570
 such commands as sometimes 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.300
 come across me and lately 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.300
 something very often happens 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.760
 but oh well, you need to train your hands 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.760
 not to merge like this 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.370
 tried well done almost 7 thousand damage it 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.890
 yes on n 306 quite successfully runs away from 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.479
 opponents and really its all the same here 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.520
 catch because one against five 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.190
 it is somehow not very yes if i stayed 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.950
 in ear b against all these five 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.770
 maybe something like that but i 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.169
 here n36 kosoruky well, hardly anything 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.930
 we can do but it happens n 306 car 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.330
 of course can not be 700 first 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.410
 the object itself is third well, at least in buttocks 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.440
 to him it was possible to break through 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.930
 I think so anyway guns 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.660
 and we have God but on this battle is coming to 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.470
 the end, he successfully shies away from the object 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.290
 701 is trying to fly at speed yet 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.930
 quarter, but receives by the rank of athos 3 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.000
 who decided here I can say well 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.370
 that with you was kadet hope you 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.850
 liked this fight this one more precisely 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.980
 have become wild but this is again 4 its 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.930
 World Ali and give and heading will go 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.110
 apparently often look even 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.000
 defeat crazy numbers for money 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.620
 112,000 so buy 701 rejoice 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.420
 life and look at the results of our 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.420
 allies bye bye
