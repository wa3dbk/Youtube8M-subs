the chat looks DVD is where I just broke
down<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.229> techniques<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:52.610> series<00:01:53.150> I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
down the techniques but this series I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.960 
down the techniques but this series I
actually<00:01:53.960> get<00:01:54.350> into<00:01:54.380> music<00:01:54.860> play<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.520> music

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970

have<00:01:59.780> put<00:01:59.960> these<00:02:00.110> Arrangements<00:02:00.710> together<00:02:01.009> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
have put these Arrangements together and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.200 
have put these Arrangements together and
just<00:02:02.479> also<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.930> sort<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.290> dissected<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.940> the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
just also to sort of dissected the the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.650 
just also to sort of dissected the the
music<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.050> know<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.229> little<00:02:06.410> more<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.649> a

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
music and you know a little more of a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.199 
music and you know a little more of a
scholastic<00:02:08.660> way<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.470> terms<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.860> how<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
scholastic way in terms of how the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.310 
scholastic way in terms of how the
harmonically<00:02:11.209> how<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.420> progressions<00:02:12.080> work

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
harmonically how the progressions work

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.270 
harmonically how the progressions work
and<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.590> know<00:02:15.650> hope<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.010> be<00:02:16.130> done

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and and so just you know hope to be done

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.180 
and and so just you know hope to be done
doing<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.820> someday<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.660> was<00:02:17.750> just

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
doing this someday but it was just

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.860 
doing this someday but it was just
something<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:20.120> seemed<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.600> logical

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:53.049 

I'll<00:04:40.219> just<00:04:40.399> do<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.580> again<00:04:51.759> well<00:04:52.759> I<00:04:52.789> think

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:53.059 
I'll just do that again well I think

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.540 
I'll just do that again well I think
what<00:04:53.389> really<00:04:53.629> makes<00:04:53.779> this<00:04:54.289> series<00:04:54.949> different

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
what really makes this series different

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.100 
what really makes this series different
something<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.330> think<00:04:56.389> that<00:04:56.659> people<00:04:56.839> would

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
something I think that people would

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.459 
something I think that people would
appreciate<00:04:57.379> is<00:04:57.889> that<00:04:58.779> it's<00:04:59.779> just<00:04:59.990> not<00:05:00.229> like<00:05:00.409> a

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
appreciate is that it's just not like a

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.439 
appreciate is that it's just not like a
typical<00:05:00.800> DVD<00:05:01.369> series<00:05:01.699> where<00:05:01.909> you<00:05:02.270> know<00:05:02.389> an

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
typical DVD series where you know an

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:03.760 
typical DVD series where you know an
artist<00:05:02.629> shows<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.259> where<00:05:03.439> to<00:05:03.469> put<00:05:03.709> your

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
artist shows you where to put your

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.129 
artist shows you where to put your
fingers<00:05:04.279> and<00:05:04.459> you<00:05:04.580> just<00:05:04.759> mimic<00:05:05.719> what<00:05:05.990> they

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
fingers and you just mimic what they

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.409 
fingers and you just mimic what they
tell<00:05:06.349> you<00:05:06.439> to<00:05:06.529> do<00:05:06.939> certainly<00:05:07.939> you<00:05:07.999> can<00:05:08.179> watch

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
tell you to do certainly you can watch

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:18.369 
know harmonically how these pieces are
put<00:05:16.669> together<00:05:16.789> and<00:05:17.360> about<00:05:17.929> how<00:05:18.050> Chet

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 
put together and about how Chet

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.089 
put together and about how Chet
interprets<00:05:19.039> these<00:05:19.339> pieces<00:05:19.639> and<00:05:19.999> how<00:05:20.119> how<00:05:20.959> he

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
interprets these pieces and how how he

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.639 
interprets these pieces and how how he
hears<00:05:22.119> the<00:05:23.119> space<00:05:23.539> in<00:05:23.839> between<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.289> notes<00:05:24.499> and

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:24.649 
hears the space in between the notes and

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.189 
hears the space in between the notes and
how<00:05:24.769> he<00:05:24.849> vocalizes<00:05:25.849> through<00:05:26.569> his<00:05:26.749> guitar<00:05:27.169> and

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
how he vocalizes through his guitar and

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.829 
how he vocalizes through his guitar and
I<00:05:27.439> think<00:05:27.649> this<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:28.009> something<00:05:28.969> significant<00:05:29.689> it

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
I think this is something significant it

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.629 
I think this is something significant it
comes<00:05:30.019> closer<00:05:30.379> to<00:05:30.559> striking<00:05:31.279> the<00:05:31.339> core<00:05:31.610> of

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
comes closer to striking the core of

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.429 
comes closer to striking the core of
what<00:05:31.939> Chet<00:05:32.300> was<00:05:32.449> all<00:05:32.569> about<00:05:32.839> it's<00:05:33.110> about<00:05:33.169> his

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
what Chet was all about it's about his

00:05:33.439 --> 00:06:17.070 
what Chet was all about it's about his
musicianship<00:05:34.009> in<00:05:34.309> the<00:05:34.369> poetry<00:05:34.909> of<00:05:34.939> his<00:05:35.119> music

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080
