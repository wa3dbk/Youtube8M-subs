00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you know $70 is a bit much for the tech

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
you know $70 is a bit much for the tech
that<00:01:39.539> is<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.319> place<00:01:41.030> Phylon<00:01:42.030> midsole<00:01:43.310> last

that is not in place Phylon midsole last

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.739 
that is not in place Phylon midsole last
time<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.579> said<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:45.030> Lunarlon<00:01:45.359> in<00:01:45.630> there

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
time I said this was Lunarlon in there

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.260 
time I said this was Lunarlon in there
but<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.929> was<00:01:46.289> wrong<00:01:46.469> it<00:01:46.679> was<00:01:46.709> a<00:01:46.859> its<00:01:47.249> soul<00:01:47.880> soft

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
but I was wrong it was a its soul soft

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.989 
but I was wrong it was a its soul soft
or<00:01:48.600> solar<00:01:49.020> soft<00:01:49.380> or<00:01:49.590> something<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.889> that<00:01:49.999> it

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
or solar soft or something like that it

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.609 
or solar soft or something like that it
is<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.359> is<00:01:51.509> comfortable<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.319> just<00:01:52.380> real

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
is it is comfortable but it's just real

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.469 
is it is comfortable but it's just real
thin<00:01:52.859> I<00:01:52.889> wish<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:53.429> was<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
thin I wish that there was more of it

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.570 
thin I wish that there was more of it
pull<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.200> out<00:01:57.509> all<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.659> stuff<00:01:59.049> so<00:01:59.580> it's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
pull it out all that stuff so it's

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.039 
pull it out all that stuff so it's
basically<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.060> same<00:02:01.090> thickness<00:02:01.570> as<00:02:01.840> any

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
basically the same thickness as any

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.560 
basically the same thickness as any
other<00:02:02.290> like<00:02:02.590> regular<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.759> know<00:02:03.790> Nike<00:02:04.180> insole

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
other like regular you know Nike insole

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.780 
other like regular you know Nike insole
and<00:02:04.720> everything<00:02:05.110> which<00:02:06.040> is<00:02:06.070> which<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.580> fine

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
and everything which is which is fine

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.790 
and everything which is which is fine
but<00:02:07.149> again<00:02:07.540> this<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.289> like<00:02:08.440> where<00:02:08.679> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
but again this is like where the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.260 
but again this is like where the
comforts<00:02:09.190> coming<00:02:09.489> from<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.849> stepping

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
comforts coming from and stepping

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.550 
comforts coming from and stepping
comfort<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.810> do<00:02:10.899> wish<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.530> a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
comfort so I do wish that this is a

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.229 
comfort so I do wish that this is a
little<00:02:11.770> bit<00:02:11.890> thicker<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.340> think<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.120> that

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
little bit thicker I think that that

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.520 
little bit thicker I think that that
would<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.510> added<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.959> little<00:02:14.110> bit<00:02:14.290> more

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
would have added a little bit more

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.670 
would have added a little bit more
substance<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.870> something<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.110> minimal<00:02:17.530> like

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
substance to something so minimal like

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.090 
substance to something so minimal like
this<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.880> again<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.690> what<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:21.010> know

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
this but again it is what it is you know

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.590 
this but again it is what it is you know
either<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.489> buy<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.000> like<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.269> or

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
either you buy it because you like it or

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.380 
either you buy it because you like it or
maybe<00:02:23.470> your<00:02:24.040> high<00:02:24.220> beast<00:02:24.489> like<00:02:24.700> myself<00:02:24.970> I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
maybe your high beast like myself I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.610 
maybe your high beast like myself I
don't<00:02:25.630> know

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
don't know

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.860 
don't know
no<00:02:27.280> I'm<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.880> kidding<00:02:28.060> though<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.569> don't<00:02:28.690> have

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
no I'm just kidding though I don't have

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.540 
no I'm just kidding though I don't have
any<00:02:29.019> like<00:02:29.319> there's<00:02:29.680> no<00:02:29.830> real<00:02:30.010> hype<00:02:30.190> towards

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
any like there's no real hype towards

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.300 
any like there's no real hype towards
these<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.910> don't<00:02:31.150> think<00:02:31.440> or<00:02:32.440> maybe<00:02:32.830> there<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
these I don't think or maybe there is I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.220 
these I don't think or maybe there is I
don't<00:02:33.340> know<00:02:33.549> but<00:02:34.150> I'm<00:02:34.750> talking<00:02:35.019> about<00:02:35.049> this

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
don't know but I'm talking about this

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.539 
don't know but I'm talking about this
colorway<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.769> that<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.010> shoe<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.340> pretty

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
colorway I know that the shoe is pretty

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.520 
colorway I know that the shoe is pretty
hyped<00:02:36.790> up<00:02:36.910> right<00:02:37.120> now<00:02:37.299> but<00:02:37.569> um<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.049> always<00:02:38.290> like

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530

hyped up right now but um I always like
the<00:02:38.650> silhouette<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.100> thought<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.430> silhouette

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
the silhouette I thought the silhouette

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.490 
the silhouette I thought the silhouette
was<00:02:39.850> clean<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.720> thought<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.290> money

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
was clean I just thought that the money

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.380 
was clean I just thought that the money
wasn't<00:02:42.190> quite<00:02:42.519> worth<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:42.940> thought<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.239> is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
wasn't quite worth it I thought this is

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.650 
wasn't quite worth it I thought this is
like<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.540> 30<00:02:43.840> $40<00:02:44.670> sometimes<00:02:45.670> $50<00:02:46.180> depending<00:02:46.450> on

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
like a 30 $40 sometimes $50 depending on

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.020 
like a 30 $40 sometimes $50 depending on
the<00:02:46.750> colorway<00:02:47.019> purchase<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:48.280> one<00:02:48.489> again<00:02:49.000> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
the colorway purchase this one again I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
the colorway purchase this one again I
did<00:02:49.299> pay<00:02:49.480> full<00:02:49.690> price<00:02:49.769> 69<00:02:50.769> which<00:02:50.980> isn't<00:02:51.130> too

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
did pay full price 69 which isn't too

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.150 
did pay full price 69 which isn't too
bad<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.549> guess<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:53.170> things<00:02:53.680> considered

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
bad I guess all things considered

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.259 
bad I guess all things considered
because<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.459> did<00:02:54.610> buy<00:02:54.730> another<00:02:54.910> pair<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.180> shoes

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
because I did buy another pair of shoes

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.979 
because I did buy another pair of shoes
which<00:02:55.630> were<00:02:55.660> 125<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:57.480> when<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.569> look<00:02:58.720> at<00:02:58.840> it

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
which were 125 so when you look at it

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.680 
which were 125 so when you look at it
that<00:02:59.110> way<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.560> guess<00:03:00.310> yeah<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.299> is<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.450> better

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
that way I guess yeah this is a better

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.099 
that way I guess yeah this is a better
better<00:03:02.260> deal<00:03:02.560> or<00:03:02.859> whatever<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:04.750> yeah<00:03:04.870> I

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
better deal or whatever so but yeah I

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.560 
better deal or whatever so but yeah I
