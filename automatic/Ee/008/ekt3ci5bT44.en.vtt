my many conversations with college
coaches<00:05:44.540> they<00:05:45.050> have<00:05:45.200> told<00:05:45.470> me<00:05:45.650> that<00:05:45.680> they<00:05:45.919> look

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
coaches they have told me that they look

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.350 
coaches they have told me that they look
at<00:05:46.370> one<00:05:46.640> thing<00:05:46.970> primarily<00:05:47.660> when<00:05:47.960> they<00:05:48.050> look

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
at one thing primarily when they look

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.570 
at one thing primarily when they look
bring<00:05:48.629> a<00:05:48.900> player<00:05:49.439> up<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.830> their<00:05:49.979> level<00:05:50.159> of<00:05:50.340> play

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
bring a player up to their level of play

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.360 
bring a player up to their level of play
and<00:05:50.849> that<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.509> the<00:05:51.930> ability<00:05:52.229> with<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:52.949> ball

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
and that is the ability with the ball

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.640 
and that is the ability with the ball
what<00:05:53.610> can<00:05:53.789> that<00:05:53.819> player<00:05:54.210> do<00:05:54.870> on<00:05:55.229> the<00:05:55.469> ball

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
what can that player do on the ball

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.950 
what can that player do on the ball
because<00:05:56.129> ninety-nine<00:05:57.120> point<00:05:57.360> nine<00:05:57.449> percent

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
because ninety-nine point nine percent

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.110 
because ninety-nine point nine percent
of<00:05:58.050> college<00:05:58.259> coaches<00:05:58.740> really<00:05:59.460> believe<00:05:59.789> that

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
of college coaches really believe that

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.850 
of college coaches really believe that
they<00:06:00.240> can<00:06:00.270> teach<00:06:00.629> the<00:06:00.870> tactics<00:06:01.349> their<00:06:01.590> teams

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
they can teach the tactics their teams

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.159 
they can teach the tactics their teams
are<00:06:02.400> going<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.669> play<00:06:02.849> under<00:06:03.240> during<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:03.930> four

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
are going to play under during the four

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.749 
are going to play under during the four
years<00:06:04.199> that<00:06:04.560> those<00:06:04.800> players<00:06:05.069> are<00:06:05.310> at<00:06:05.340> college

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
years that those players are at college

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.879 
years that those players are at college
but<00:06:06.240> they<00:06:06.360> know<00:06:06.659> that<00:06:06.960> they<00:06:07.110> cannot<00:06:07.409> teach<00:06:07.710> a

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
but they know that they cannot teach a

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.610 
but they know that they cannot teach a
player<00:06:08.099> to<00:06:08.669> be<00:06:08.789> incredibly<00:06:09.620> technically

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
player to be incredibly technically

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.070 
player to be incredibly technically
gifted<00:06:10.860> in<00:06:11.340> force<00:06:11.969> your<00:06:12.240> ears<00:06:12.659> especially

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
gifted in force your ears especially

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.899 
gifted in force your ears especially
being<00:06:13.710> as<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:13.979> players<00:06:14.219> that<00:06:14.340> they<00:06:14.580> get<00:06:14.789> in

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
being as the players that they get in

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.570 
being as the players that they get in
already<00:06:15.240> 18<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.650> body<00:06:16.860> loses<00:06:17.129> its

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
already 18 and the body loses its

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.879 
already 18 and the body loses its
ability<00:06:17.669> to<00:06:18.090> learn<00:06:18.240> new<00:06:18.479> skills<00:06:18.659> as<00:06:19.169> it<00:06:19.740> ages

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
ability to learn new skills as it ages

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.279 
ability to learn new skills as it ages
so<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:20.939> much<00:06:21.120> of<00:06:21.240> that<00:06:21.330> technical<00:06:21.810> skill<00:06:22.050> is

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
so so much of that technical skill is

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.260 
so so much of that technical skill is
set<00:06:22.889> in<00:06:23.039> stone<00:06:23.279> by<00:06:23.520> the<00:06:23.550> time<00:06:23.879> that<00:06:23.909> player

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
set in stone by the time that player

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.490 
set in stone by the time that player
reaches<00:06:24.770> collegiate<00:06:25.770> recruiting<00:06:26.129> age
