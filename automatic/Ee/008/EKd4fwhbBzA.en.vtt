00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.339
 Hello, about the middle 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.850
 sixteenth century there is a legend 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.490
 according to which 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.160
 simple chicken egg impossible 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.929
 cook in the microwave 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.170
 according to this legend if you put 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.840
 raw egg microwave on well there 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.100
 flooded so what to check this 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.539
 try to hold the legend 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.340
 experimentation and i will use 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.949
 microwave package 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.240
 furnaces 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:32.240
 set to the fibers full throttle and 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.240
 forward 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.980
 Well, how instantly really 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.980
 the rights 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.479
 but 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.560
 however cook egg in the microwave 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.219
 still feasible for this we smear 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.679
 plate of margarine right on the plate 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:35.469
 break an egg or 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:38.579
 eggs we put it all inside cookies 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:44.100
 project, we will present the genre 252 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.100
 time 4 minutes 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.270
 well that's what we got 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.810
 that's how it all looks in just four 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.409
 minutes 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.119
