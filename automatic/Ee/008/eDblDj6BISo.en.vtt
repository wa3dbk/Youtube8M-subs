00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.560
shall we?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.560
you're serious?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.940
oh, why not?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.060
see you're dancing

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760
at prom

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.140
Edward, why did you save me?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.800
You just let the venom spread

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.120
I can be like you right now.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
You don't know what you're saying

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.480
You don't want this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.860
I want you

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.940
Always

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
I'm not gonna end your life for you

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
I'm dying

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
already

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.440
every second I get closer

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.100
older

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.100
that's the way it's supposed to be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780
Alice said that she saw me like you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.200
I heard her

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
The vision's changed

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400
It's based on what people decide

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.140
I decided

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900
So that's what you dream about

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.860
becoming a monster?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.040
I've dreamt of being with you forever

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280
forever?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520
And you're ready right now?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.920
Yes

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.920
Is it not enough

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
just to have a long and happy life with me?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.420

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.640
Yeah

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.060
For now
