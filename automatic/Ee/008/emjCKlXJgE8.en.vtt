 joints the problems of column 6 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.780
 this what many people do not know 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.600
 is that our clinic in addition to the department as you well said of 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.850
 medicine leisure my joint that refers to the problem of sportsman 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.360
 those to joints of the spine 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.710
 we have already a few years ago a department month and nanti hellín and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.960
 longevity a department that I think the sil lesion of parliament that I want 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.110
 to make it public to people I want at least people do not know what 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.910
 that we were of what we are talking about, know what is happening in 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.420
 preventive medicine stuff from the first world and we all know that medicine 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.530
 preventive is definitely much healthier for the patient and 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.800
 much more economical for other estates of health than medicine 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.340
 curative or the paliativas missive doctor boast all the public p when 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.090
 we talk about e al huti hellín 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 you can be raising a viewer perfectly 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.009
 is slowing down the aging something natural 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.360
 since we are born 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.920
 we are aging how is this from Antilla and without first saying that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.870
 we refer to aland and without clinical chemists during the inta 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.750
 goal the aesthetic part is the surgical part ainsa and several automobiles 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.500
 santiaguinos do it 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.450
 medicine 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.170
 clinic deny 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.009
 pique what happens with respect to the cut says 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.070
 horned 28 or 30 years 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.160
 percent in our human beings in general 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
 we have blind 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.559
 more or less to that acquisition 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.090
 there to partires hadad 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.630
 there begins to produce a deterioration point 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.889
 fundamentally physical although of poems before also psychological of 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.490
 our functional capabilities which is what we do 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.030
 in antiaging medicine and without the longevity misery what we are trying to stop 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.729
 to reverse to minimize 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:05.729
 all 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.879
 that those biological aspects that then the end 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.469
 revertibles ti minimized 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.269
 the being 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.950
 by slowing down the whole phenomenon of aging in fact 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.099
 in the world 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.109
 East Island 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.069
 i when we talk about 9 pointing aging by the world the world 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.669
 scientist the world to which I belong 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.230
 aging goes associated 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.340
 hans armera 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.389
 today it is said 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.150
 toll getting older he means tampa over the years I'm getting older 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.439
 undefeated and sick today 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.319
 the term of the passage of the years without diseases is called longevity going to 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.559
 cost a lot 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.909
 change the concept of aging a synonym for disease 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.620
 by john g vidad synonym of passing the years with health then what does 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.490
 is and first to predict 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.170
 that we are members of several paca of mine apart external aggression 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.459
 several academies that endorse bull that was given fundamentally the United States 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.249
 this is born in the united states this was born in 1993 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:11.420
 In Chicago 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.650
 in fact I was saying off camera this year if God willing I'm going to 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.160
 attend the 17th 17th congress Messina before him and I did not go to the United States 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.910
 and here the banana just to explain what we're talking about 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.620
 and fundamentally in medicine before and the first thing to do is a 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.129
 diagnosis of situation to the doctor can 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:35.840
 come submit good 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.379
 you can go me dr I feel males rogers and just like 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.430
 all phenomena doctor can but we really until you do not 

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:48.659
 we look at the biological markers of aging that, among other things, 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.949
 do with special blood alexis we will not know exactly how the 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.020
 doctor poly is 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.370
 the author says you may feel barbarous the doctor can feel the other 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.520
 until we see 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.169
 the specific analyzes we do not go to specific analysis rooms that do not 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.090
 inventions me 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.150
 the analyzes specified 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.180
 that is done through the bull what the American scientific contributions and 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.509
 Europeans call 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.150
 through the american academy fanti without messi call you high street 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.470
 doctrines susaeta shelves and medical are those who tell us 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.800
 these are the guidelines to follow to know if the person 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.589
 the regular workshop is fine or it is very aged because it covered convergence 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.039
 how much have we seen people 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.620
 of dec of equis and zeda for example 50 years that look 70 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.800
 you have never seen a person need absolutely never seen 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.610
 a person 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.730
 that is much better 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.910
 nor of what seems beyond this tic tuesday because she can not put on makeup and 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.670
 to be made 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.510
 percent and surgical issues there's really a whole clinical concept 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.650
 internal biological 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.860
 that hear the world medicine 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.360
 can handle it we can handle it we can see the values ​​and tell it 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.840
 this value is fine is regular is wrong and if it is wrong we are going to 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.840
 improve it and if we do not improve we are rejuvenating 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.610
 it is a very strong concept very strong is a concept that Uruguayan society 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.889
 but must incorporate at least what should incorporate riki and that's why doctor 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.580
 jack but you will be 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.639
 also talking about this topic 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.780
 quality of life is very important healthy aging you said 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.400
 arrecian 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.419
 there are people 50 years old 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.219
 that look 70 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.229
 because because aging has not been healthy 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.020
 soriano have been careful 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.470
 because they have not controlled the pressure because they have eaten anything 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.559
 because they are sedentary because they smoke 4 castilla per day of cigarettes 12 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.360
 that's what the doctor says 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.080
 that's what anti allen medicine aims for 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.449
 doctor will be a pleasure to have it also on Thursdays with this theme 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.870
 as gladly to his orders and decided that he did not like on Tuesday 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.449
 on Tuesday of course
