00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.089
 Hello guys all I will not show you how 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.950
 make music through 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:13.969
 mod ver and advanced 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.969
 just such a thing 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.519
 please enjoy music playing 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.050
 tired of turning off work this whole 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.050
 bullshit through this flash drive 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.690
 so click nifiga 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.690
 we insert the USB stick 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.320
 everything worked so now turn off 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:01:00.190
 take remuver 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.930
 here I am, we all nafig and let's start 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.060
 everything from scratch 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.540
 so take the buttons well, choose as 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:21.119
 want i like to put the inclusion 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:29.280
 increasing hats so we go to the case 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:32.380
 we take the chip we put here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.790
 select here in the selection folder 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 gates and hp 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.420
 Exactly this file without this file 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.789
 that is, it will be like a conductor and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.200
 it will simply turn on from the button 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.319
 cleaned inserted bad whether frantic 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.500
 better if you want it with fajita 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:57.509
 choose this file this way now 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.750
 further hair constants 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:08.640
 we take a little leps 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:13.240
 yes, I forgot to say before choosing 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.040
 a snail here is a must 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.490
 put units instead of 0 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:27.040
 otherwise no effect at all 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:29.459
 stupidly sound 0 will continue to take out 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.459
 neighbors 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:40.190
 and on the second mouse button from here and from 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:42.700
 Bishkek appears bad so now it 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.709
 we will connect everything 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.590
 faith advances from in leave here well and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.870
 you will be put somewhere like this 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.920
 set to zero so that no 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 and not all cultures were transparent 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 take set and switch to 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.090
 and beating the entrance then we take the fleet on the scaffold 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:21.700
 a and 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:29.500
 amp now take the letter b put on 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:36.099
 inclusion everything is so now take play and 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.099
 we put on the controller 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:04:09.920
 tickler 100 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:20.380
 stupidly on the shutdown button all bad and 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:20.380
 body nifiga and this miracle returned to hearing 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.409
 make up 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.409
 then it works 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.550
 here 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.580
 shorter guys if there are ideas how to make 

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:46.649
 increase and decrease the volume or 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.050
 there let's say switching songs to 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:52.069
 playlist and write everything else in 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.069
 comments all bye
