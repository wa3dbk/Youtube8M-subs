setting this will really help a lot the
next<00:01:54.329> thing<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.600> will<00:01:54.810> talk<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.320> because

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
next thing I will talk about is because

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.319 
next thing I will talk about is because
the<00:01:55.770> pro<00:01:55.979> camera<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> function

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the pro camera actually have a function

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.850 
the pro camera actually have a function
called<00:01:57.570> war<00:01:57.780> shot<00:01:57.990> means<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> moment

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
called war shot means that the moment

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
called war shot means that the moment
you<00:01:59.040> take<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> picture<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.700> save<00:01:59.939> two<00:02:00.149> files

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you take a picture you save two files

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
you take a picture you save two files
one<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> high<00:02:01.140> resolution<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.890> otherwise

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
one is the high resolution and otherwise

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.429 
one is the high resolution and otherwise
it<00:02:02.430> fast<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> 5-megapixel<00:02:03.329> picture<00:02:03.990> which

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it fast and a 5-megapixel picture which

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.620 
it fast and a 5-megapixel picture which
actually<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.920> lot<00:02:05.100> user<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.549> share<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.060> directly

the the reframing story that I talked

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.479 
the the reframing story that I talked
about<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.349> this<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.560> one<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.069> picture<00:02:18.370> i

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
about so this is one of the picture i

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.259 
about so this is one of the picture i
took<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:19.269> last<00:02:20.190> few<00:02:21.190> days<00:02:21.370> ago<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:22.090> what

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
took the last few days ago so what

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.759 
took the last few days ago so what
happened<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.599> if<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.930> open<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.260> picture<00:02:23.620> if

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
happened is if you open this picture if

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.820 
happened is if you open this picture if
Nokia<00:02:24.129> program<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:25.209> actually<00:02:25.569> see<00:02:25.959> these

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
Nokia program you actually see these

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.089 
Nokia program you actually see these
pictures<00:02:27.129> of<00:02:27.489> actual<00:02:28.170> bill<00:02:29.170> was<00:02:29.410> about<00:02:29.920> this

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
pictures of actual bill was about this

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.490 
pictures of actual bill was about this
so<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.269> 41-megapixel<00:02:31.690> sensor

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
so because of the 41-megapixel sensor

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.800 
so because of the 41-megapixel sensor
size<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:33.940> actually<00:02:34.239> capture<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.540> lot<00:02:34.720> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
size you can actually capture a lot of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.839 
size you can actually capture a lot of
data<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.650> can<00:02:35.799> zoom<00:02:35.980> into<00:02:36.190> each<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
data and you can zoom into each of the

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.940 
data and you can zoom into each of the
d2<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.720> best<00:02:37.900> thing<00:02:38.049> is<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.379> can<00:02:38.650> actually

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
d2 and the best thing is I can actually

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.600 
d2 and the best thing is I can actually
save<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:40.110> frame<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.349> want<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.920> then<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> can

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
save the frame I want and then I can

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.729 
save the frame I want and then I can
come<00:02:42.819> back<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.090> can<00:02:43.269> do<00:02:43.450> my<00:02:43.629> reframe<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.319> move

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
come back I can do my reframe and move

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.130 
come back I can do my reframe and move
into<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.250> other<00:02:45.370> picture<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.420> user<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.930> see

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
into the other picture so user can see

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.620 
into the other picture so user can see
if<00:02:47.200> can<00:02:47.890> create<00:02:48.190> one<00:02:48.370> pic<00:02:48.579> multiple<00:02:49.450> pictures

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
if can create one pic multiple pictures

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.720 
if can create one pic multiple pictures
or<00:02:49.900> one<00:02:50.140> pictures<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.099> one<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.519> cool

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
or one pictures so one of the cool

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.069 
or one pictures so one of the cool
things<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.180> program<00:02:52.569> allows<00:02:52.810> user<00:02:52.959> to

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
things that the program allows user to

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.680 
things that the program allows user to
do<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.440> taking<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:54.610> light<00:02:54.819> rail<00:02:54.849> we<00:02:55.299> call<00:02:55.510> like

do is taking the light rail we call like

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.970 
do is taking the light rail we call like
painting<00:02:56.049> pictures<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:56.590> have<00:02:56.799> some
