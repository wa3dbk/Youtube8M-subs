00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.019
 I am the founder 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 in this video review I will explain why for 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 warehouse walk need special shelves 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 than stick for nordic walking 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.730
 different from all others and why one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.859
 can not replace the other given 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 features of nordic walking technique 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.250
 and operating conditions 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 for canadian walking classes 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 designed special shelves they have 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.890
 the special shape of the handle is thin 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.530
 long 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.350
 This form provides comfortable grip and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.360
 comfortable in the hand given 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.840
 year-round use in heat and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.270
 cold 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.300
 it is made from materials that are not 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.570
 rub the hand warm the cold and remove 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.920
 under and moisture in summer 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.109
 stick for nordic walking has 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.149
 lanyard glove- like system trap 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.939
 which securely fixes the brush 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.159
 preventing joints from unmounted injuries 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.810
 provides the right grip and movement 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.890
 brushes to use technology 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 nordic walking 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 the lanyard has holes separately for 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.000
 thumb and for all brush thongs 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 made specifically for left and right 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.150
 hands has many adjustments for 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 an exact fit to your brush size 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.140
 shelves for screen as walk is matched 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.829
 under your height by a special formula your 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.270
 growth multiplied by 068 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.030
 manufacturer produces 7 different lengths 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.950
 under any human height the shelves come from 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.040
 100 to 130 centimeters 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 step 5 centimeters shelf for screenshots 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.210
 walk must contain 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.700
 carbon is the standard for the sky 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.310
 walking carbon thread woven into 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.520
 fiberglass depending on its model 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.320
 maybe 10 to 100 percent carbon 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.079
 this stuff that make the wand 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.350
 super lightweight elastic and durable it is very 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.610
 important characteristics of the walking technique 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 implies that you train for 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 account work by their own weight they are 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.369
 what are you carrying weight shelves 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.649
 so the stick should be super light 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.660
 so as not to hamper your movements and not 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.640
 load the joints 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 due to flexibility and resilience 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.990
 additional training appears 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.390
 shelf effect pushing you forward 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.820
 increasing the load and very importantly 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.670
 dampens vibrations and protects your 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.130
 joints strength is needed because in 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.860
 the process of walking on a stick is carried over to 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.560
 forty percent of the body weight of the shelf is just 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.730
 must withstand a similar load stick 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.070
 for nordic walking 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.650
 completed with tips for solid 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.780
 and soft surfaces on the stick fixed 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.990
 sharp metal tip for 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.880
 walking on soft ground with snow and sand 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.620
 he is made of his alloy will win 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.630
 that allows you to walk with him even 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.030
 asphalt for example in winter 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.010
 iron tip power worn 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.050
 rubber tip for asphalt and 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 solid surfaces service life 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.360
 iron tip about two years 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.760
 tires rub out faster and serve around 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.290
 three to four months 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.990
 shelves for skiing hellish screenshots 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.190
 walking do not fit ski poles 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.860
 made of metal 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.290
 it is very heavy material besides 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.540
 does not bend and does not quench vibration because of what 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.760
 hand quickly gets tired of carrying such sticks and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.390
 creates a heavy load on the brush 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.520
 hand joints which can lead to injury 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.980
 The shape of the handle and loop is made for a convenient 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.930
 holding the shelves during the descent from the mountain and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.790
 absolutely not meant for 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.320
 use of Scandinavian technology 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.120
 walk 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.340
 ski stick with knees for 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.440
 fingers and it is wider than handles for 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.180
 Scandinavian walk twice what not 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.850
 allows you to do the right emphasis and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.550
 push-off loops ski 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.709
 the sticks do not fix the hand what can 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.600
 lead to injured tips 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.570
 ski poles is designed to 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.770
 stuck in the snow and not intended in 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.860
 difference from special 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.110
 for sticking sand and asphalt into the ground 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.270
 total tips paid off through 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.550
 one to two days of use with it 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.650
 ski stick has no rubber 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.110
 tips for walking on asphalt 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.430
 running ski poles most 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.300
 resemble sticks for scandinavian 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.700
 walk 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.320
 but there are a number of fundamental differences in 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.780
 which use them to ski us to 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.299
 walking is impossible just like 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.580
 ski sticks simple ski runs 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.130
 sticks made of metal and and 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.290
 fiberglass without carbon 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.240
 this material can not withstand the load 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.450
 during Nordic walking lessons 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.830
 stick loops do not fix the hand that 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.600
 may cause injury 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.630
 and do not allow to use correctly 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.850
 emphasis and stick repulsion expensive runs 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.070
 ski poles are composed of carbon and 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.190
 equipped with suitable mist mist 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.320
 vedi system trap but ski poles 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.390
 much longer than the Scandinavian sticks 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.490
 and children's shelves can not bear weight 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.970
 adult man and for walking not 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.400
 suitable pout tips are designed 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.440
 for sticking the snow is not intended 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.020
 unlike special for sticking in 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.120
 sand and asphalt soil as a result 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.580
 tips will be painted in one-two 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.440
 days of use while skiing 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.870
 do not have opened their lugs for 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.460
 walking on asphalt 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.740
 assuming the adaptation is expensive 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.690
 ski poles for Nordic walking 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.610
 then for this they need to be shortened and 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.370
 add a tip for the primer and 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.800
 asphalt that ultimately cost 5 6 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.370
 thousand rubles with a good screen 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.900
 hellish regiments cost 34 thousand rubles 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.080
 the benefit of adaptation is quite 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.360
 questionable trekking sticks which 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.010
 sold in most tourist 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.260
 stores erroneously unknowingly 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.310
 positioned by sellers as sticks for 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.220
 nordic walking 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.740
 they are just like ski ones made from 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.930
 metal thing is that when climbing in 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.480
 mountains where trekking poles are used 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.890
 metal if you bent the shelf and stone 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.440
 easy to straighten 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.380
 and continue climbing but such sticks 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.480
 very heavy and do not dampen the form 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.880
 lanyard handles are the same as in 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.890
 ski stick does it all 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.440
 use trekking sticks drives us 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.660
 at least impossible with trekking poles 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.870
 and sticks for sky walk screenshots 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.030
 completely opposite goals first 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.430
 designed to facilitate climbing and 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.470
 serves as a shelf support for screen as to 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.100
 walking on the contrary are designed to increase 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.410
 load will use all the muscles of the body 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.270
 you can always try to change 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.550
 redo the shelves but the price is rework 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.550
 will always be more expensive than special chambers 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.560
 consciously 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.560
 finance to walk inclusive 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.550
 features of this particular fitness 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.440
 always specialized in stores 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.480
 a wide range of floor where the screen Orsk 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.700
 walk for every taste and wallet 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.280
 if you decide to do screen hellish 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.200
 walking seriously then the right decision 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.830
 will start classes with special 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.410
 shelves 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.410
 comfort and joy
