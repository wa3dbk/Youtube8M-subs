the<00:01:10.409> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> films<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> kind<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the kind of films you get a kind of

you get you for it kind of difference
yeah<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.280> different<00:01:17.490> in

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
yeah I think it's all it's different in

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.260 
yeah I think it's all it's different in
the<00:01:17.820> sense<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.479> know<00:01:18.950> where<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.280> start

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the sense that you know where we start

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
the sense that you know where we start
is<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.470> image<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.850> my

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
is the kind of image that you are you my

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.910 
is the kind of image that you are you my
kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> carry<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> while<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.500> having

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
kind of carry for a while so having

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
kind of carry for a while so having
started<00:01:26.280> being<00:01:26.520> heated<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> having

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
started being heated out and having

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.760 
started being heated out and having
played<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.080> certain<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> people

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
played it in a certain way and people

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.679 
played it in a certain way and people
liked<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.369> much<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.329> definitely

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
liked it so much it was definitely

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
liked it so much it was definitely
different<00:01:30.960> difficult<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> move<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.369> from

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
different difficult to move on from

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.499 
different difficult to move on from
there<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> kept<00:01:35.670> getting<00:01:35.850> roles<00:01:36.240> very

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
there and so I kept getting roles very

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.060 
there and so I kept getting roles very
similar<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
similar to that and I think that's the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 
similar to that and I think that's the
reason<00:01:38.310> why<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> consciously<00:01:39.150> started<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> try

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
reason why I consciously started to try

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
reason why I consciously started to try
and<00:01:40.229> move<00:01:40.350> away<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and move away because you know you get a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.789 
and move away because you know you get a
bit<00:01:42.360> stayed<00:01:42.630> doing<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> same<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> thing

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
bit stayed doing the same kind of thing

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
bit stayed doing the same kind of thing
I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.280> any<00:01:44.399> any<00:01:44.490> actor<00:01:44.970> does<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> little

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
I think any any actor does get a little

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
I think any any actor does get a little
bored<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.259> doing<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.500> similar<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> thing

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bored of doing a similar kind of thing

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.710 
bored of doing a similar kind of thing
and<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.430> want<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> try<00:01:47.850> something<00:01:48.119> different

and you want to try something different

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.450 
and you want to try something different

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
there's a perception in Indian audiences

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.700

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
generation of the new people I'm kind of

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
generation of the new people I'm kind of
breaking<00:01:56.399> those<00:01:57.090> boundaries<00:01:57.420> yeah<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
breaking those boundaries yeah with it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
breaking those boundaries yeah with it
so<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.500> or<00:01:58.770> Kajol<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.219> course<00:01:59.399> she's<00:01:59.520> for

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
so you or Kajol of course she's for

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
so you or Kajol of course she's for
senior<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.780> how<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.140> manage<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
senior but you know how do you manage to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
senior but you know how do you manage to
do<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.119> married<00:02:03.390> woman

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
do that because I think a married woman

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.480 
do that because I think a married woman
can<00:02:03.780> carry<00:02:03.990> off<00:02:04.140> any<00:02:04.409> role<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.920> convincingly

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
can carry off any role as convincingly

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
can carry off any role as convincingly
but<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> super<00:02:06.540> glam<00:02:06.750> role<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> one

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
but it's a super glam role like the one

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.029 
but it's a super glam role like the one
you're<00:02:07.439> doing<00:02:07.649> yeah<00:02:08.060> yeah<00:02:09.530> I've<00:02:10.530> always<00:02:10.920> taken

John is actually different when acting

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.460 
John is actually different when acting
with<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.730> actor<00:03:18.329> who's<00:03:18.600> not<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.019> commercial

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
with the actor who's not so commercial

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.319 
with the actor who's not so commercial
and<00:03:19.620> someone<00:03:19.799> like<00:03:19.920> Akshay<00:03:20.190> Kumar<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:21.090> comes

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
and someone like Akshay Kumar it comes

and someone like Akshay Kumar it comes
with<00:03:21.570> all<00:03:21.750> big<00:03:22.019> personality<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.890> his<00:03:23.070> own<00:03:24.500> see

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
with all big personality of his own see

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.130 
with all big personality of his own see
I<00:03:25.769> mean<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.280> mean<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.670> differences<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
I mean I mean the differences in in the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.440 
I mean I mean the differences in in the
way<00:03:28.290> they<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> performance<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:29.970> course<00:03:30.180> I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
way they in the performance of course I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.479 
way they in the performance of course I
mean<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.109> kind<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.380> performances<00:03:31.920> if<00:03:32.130> one<00:03:32.340> is

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
mean the kind of performances if one is

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.720 
mean the kind of performances if one is
given<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.820> obviously<00:03:33.120> very<00:03:33.359> different<00:03:33.570> from

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
given is obviously very different from

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.729 
given is obviously very different from
very<00:03:35.730> commercially<00:03:36.480> viable<00:03:36.750> performance

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
very commercially viable performance

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.560 
very commercially viable performance
that<00:03:37.980> Akshay<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.400> given<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:38.820> far<00:03:39.030> if<00:03:39.239> he<00:03:39.420> can

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
that Akshay is given so far if he can

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.199 
that Akshay is given so far if he can
say<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.049> know<00:03:40.079> like<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.970> yeah<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.180> I

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
say it you know like that yeah so I

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.300 
say it you know like that yeah so I
think<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.540> difference<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:42.900> mostly<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
think the difference is mostly in in the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.670 
think the difference is mostly in in the
performance<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.000> if<00:03:45.900> fun<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.320> far<00:03:46.500> more

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
performance and if fun is far more

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680 
performance and if fun is far more
understated<00:03:47.040> underplayed<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.450> know<00:03:48.570> it's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
understated underplayed you know it's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.340 
understated underplayed you know it's
very<00:03:48.870> different

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
very different

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.900 
very different
he's<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> different<00:03:49.829> kind<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.190> an<00:03:50.310> actor<00:03:50.609> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
he's a different kind of an actor and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.849 
he's a different kind of an actor and
actually<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.600> different<00:03:51.989> he's<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:52.709> much<00:03:52.829> more

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
actually is different he's so much more

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.880 
actually is different he's so much more
energy<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.549> it's<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:53.790> much<00:03:53.850> more<00:03:54.890> commercial

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
energy it's it's so much more commercial

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.949 
energy it's it's so much more commercial
in<00:03:56.069> masse<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:56.970> know<00:03:57.090> entertaining<00:03:57.390> and

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
in masse and you know entertaining and

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.259 
in masse and you know entertaining and
dramatic<00:03:58.489> and<00:03:59.489> slightly<00:03:59.730> over<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.030> top

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
dramatic and slightly over the top

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.430 
dramatic and slightly over the top
because<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.720> know<00:04:00.810> that's<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.230> need

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
because you know that's what you need

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.990 
because you know that's what you need
for<00:04:02.220> for<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.730> kind<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.030> cinema<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:05.000> think

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
for for that kind of cinema so I think

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.160 
for for that kind of cinema so I think
that's<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.390> only<00:04:06.420> difference<00:04:06.690> other<00:04:07.079> than

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
that's the only difference other than

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.509 
that's the only difference other than
that<00:04:07.410> they're<00:04:07.650> great<00:04:07.680> in<00:04:07.980> whatever<00:04:08.160> they<00:04:08.370> do

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
that they're great in whatever they do

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.729 
that they're great in whatever they do
obviously<00:04:09.389> they're<00:04:09.959> both<00:04:09.989> stars<00:04:10.500> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
obviously they're both stars and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:11.930 
obviously they're both stars and
whatever<00:04:11.010> kind<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.340> cinema<00:04:11.639> that<00:04:11.670> they<00:04:11.880> do

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
whatever kind of cinema that they do

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.000 
whatever kind of cinema that they do
tell<00:04:12.720> me<00:04:12.840> who<00:04:12.959> do<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.139> think<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.500> sexiest

don't<00:04:36.229> react<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.560> them<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:37.070> think<00:04:37.340> that's<00:04:37.610> the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
don't react to them I think that's the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.210 
don't react to them I think that's the
ideal<00:04:38.180> situation<00:04:38.350> but<00:04:39.350> having<00:04:39.710> said<00:04:39.889> that<00:04:39.919> I

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
ideal situation but having said that I

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.560 
ideal situation but having said that I
think<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.550> do<00:04:40.669> react<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.240> somewhere

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
think you do react to it somewhere

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.180 
think you do react to it somewhere
inside<00:04:42.259> it<00:04:42.440> does<00:04:42.590> trouble<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:43.009> in<00:04:43.100> the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
inside it does trouble you in the

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.600 
inside it does trouble you in the
beginning<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.889> then<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:46.009> sort<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.460> have

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
beginning and and then you sort of have
