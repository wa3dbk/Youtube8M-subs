00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.710
 hi to all this new guys 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 lot of gta 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm here with my friend Federico like that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.119
 and today we want to see all the houses that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.340
 we have unlocked gta iv 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.580
 we have to say one thing first 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 but we must unlock all the first 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 we no longer have it because in one 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.050
 mission is lost and so it goes well 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.899
 first there isn't but we have all the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 others but this is in our opinion the most 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:46.039
 beautiful that is at the center of the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.329
 second island is very beautiful big 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:55.410
 it looks more modern indeed 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.510
 awesome and it's a penthouse located 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.600
 right in the middle of the second island 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 so also in a nice area 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.150
 soon we will show you the others and there 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.880
 I am a little distant from them then 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.720
 we will go with the car and cut and there 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 see after this the second home is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.150
 This was sold as a playboy hicks 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.990
 in one of the missions or some data two 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.909
 cars and this is another penthouse 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.229
 I think it 's internally more beautiful 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.540
 however it is located in a little more area 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.210
 far more always than the island one 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.880
 second island, however, at home another theft 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.250
 there is also a nice swimming pool 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.790
 whirlpool the hydromassage pool 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.420
 in the picture in the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.470
 from the terrace to the previous 800 TV 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.770
 inch it comes out and that is beautiful 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.870
 here is the terrace or with the pool the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.770
 ours of things campaigns and nothing is not there 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.150
 nothing to see 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.729
 obviously houses are not that we can 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.979
 do us a lot that we can sleep that 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.290
 we can change save games 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.020
 that's the only thing we are 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:16.540
 important that the houses serve it 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.770
 wonderful but now we will show you the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.790
 others that are a little more ugly 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:29.110
 much more than the studios and we cut e 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.090
 when we arrive we show this 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.410
 is another of the houses is a little more 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.690
 we didn't park one 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.870
 sort of rs is in the neighborhood at 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:44.800
 city gifts this is little to see 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.440
 a room above practically more for one 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.959
 shelter is let's see it's shit 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.870
 made the other shitty theme 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.510
 and so there is the essential people and 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.330
 precisely nothing that now we de 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.570
 the last house of seem a multi one 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.570
 one 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.530
 yes last but one last case at the top 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.060
 to the right 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.200
 we cut when we get there we see 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.780
 this is the last home of this game and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.440
 if it is very similar to the other one it is always 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.040
 there's nothing special about shit 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:34.609
 you see really small product 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:37.010
 nothing that and these are nothing 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.780
 those houses are finished 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.930
 we will see you at the next video for sure 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.930
