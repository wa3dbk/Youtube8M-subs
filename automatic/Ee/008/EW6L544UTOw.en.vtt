and I think everyone's reaction just on
social<00:00:54.840> media<00:00:54.870> pretty<00:00:55.440> much<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.820> doesn't

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
social media pretty much it just doesn't

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
social media pretty much it just doesn't
even<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.780> justice<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.410> disgustingly<00:00:59.160> like
