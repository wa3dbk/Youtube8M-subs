00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
looks like a romper I actually thought

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.950

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.399 
it was but it's not this one's a little
more<00:01:01.500> interesting<00:01:02.070> um<00:01:02.899> it's<00:01:03.899> almost<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
more interesting um it's almost like a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.580 
more interesting um it's almost like a
tube<00:01:04.710> top<00:01:05.010> dress<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> also<00:01:06.869> cinches

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
tube top dress and then it also cinches

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890 
tube top dress and then it also cinches
in<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> middle<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.630> it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
in the middle I like it because if it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.670 
in the middle I like it because if it's
not<00:01:10.020> too<00:01:11.510> restricting<00:01:12.510> around<00:01:12.960> my<00:01:13.080> bust<00:01:13.350> area

not too restricting around my bust area
it<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.369> lets<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> breathe<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it actually lets it breathe and then you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.200 
it actually lets it breathe and then you
could<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.740> tie<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> middle<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.000> has
