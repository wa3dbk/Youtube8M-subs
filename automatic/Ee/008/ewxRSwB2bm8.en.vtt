with<00:04:05.650> my<00:04:05.830> class<00:04:06.010> I'm<00:04:06.610> a<00:04:06.670> woman<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.030> Gender

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
with my class I'm a woman and Gender

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.150 
with my class I'm a woman and Gender
Studies<00:04:07.300> minor<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.020> so<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.380> my<00:04:08.500> senior<00:04:08.830> sem

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
Studies minor and so in my senior sem

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.550 
Studies minor and so in my senior sem
when<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.460> was<00:04:09.700> choosing<00:04:09.880> my<00:04:10.240> project<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.900> decided

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
when I was choosing my project I decided

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.330 
when I was choosing my project I decided
to<00:04:12.060> basically<00:04:13.060> find<00:04:13.450> out<00:04:13.660> why<00:04:13.990> not<00:04:14.710> why<00:04:14.950> women

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
to basically find out why not why women

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.220 
to basically find out why not why women
don't<00:04:15.370> get<00:04:15.550> elected<00:04:15.820> but<00:04:15.910> why<00:04:16.030> many<00:04:16.989> women

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
don't get elected but why many women

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.020 
don't get elected but why many women
don't<00:04:17.380> run<00:04:17.470> for<00:04:17.620> office<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:18.730> wrote<00:04:18.910> my

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
don't run for office and so I wrote my

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.699 
don't run for office and so I wrote my
paper<00:04:19.150> about<00:04:19.510> women's<00:04:19.930> political<00:04:20.080> ambition

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
paper about women's political ambition

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.200 
paper about women's political ambition
and<00:04:20.950> how<00:04:21.100> they<00:04:21.220> become<00:04:21.400> viable<00:04:21.700> candidates

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
and how they become viable candidates

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.880 
and how they become viable candidates
and<00:04:22.420> so<00:04:22.960> what<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.140> found<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> biggest

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
and so what I found is the biggest

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.620 
and so what I found is the biggest
problem<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.430> that<00:04:24.730> women<00:04:25.000> aren't<00:04:25.150> encouraged

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
problem is that women aren't encouraged

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.510 
problem is that women aren't encouraged
that<00:04:26.230> was<00:04:26.410> like<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.680> biggest<00:04:26.920> disparity

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
that was like the biggest disparity

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.250 
that was like the biggest disparity
between<00:04:27.670> education<00:04:28.390> between<00:04:28.570> like<00:04:28.840> parent

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
between education between like parent

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.590 
between education between like parent
backgrounds<00:04:29.770> was<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.370> women<00:04:30.850> are<00:04:31.090> sixty

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
backgrounds was that women are sixty

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.120 
backgrounds was that women are sixty
percent<00:04:31.720> more<00:04:32.020> likely<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.440> run<00:04:32.620> for<00:04:32.800> office<00:04:32.830> if

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
percent more likely to run for office if

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.310 
percent more likely to run for office if
they're<00:04:33.280> encouraged<00:04:33.700> by<00:04:34.060> somebody<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.870> so

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
they're encouraged by somebody to and so

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.480 
they're encouraged by somebody to and so
I<00:04:35.350> think<00:04:35.470> it's<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:35.890> really<00:04:36.010> important<00:04:36.400> to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
I think it's just really important to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.250 
I think it's just really important to
know<00:04:36.640> that<00:04:36.670> giving<00:04:37.360> somebody<00:04:37.630> an<00:04:37.840> extra<00:04:38.050> pat

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
know that giving somebody an extra pat

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.780 
know that giving somebody an extra pat
on<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.410> back<00:04:38.650> or<00:04:38.680> tongue<00:04:39.010> some<00:04:39.250> they're<00:04:39.610> good

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
on the back or tongue some they're good

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.060 
on the back or tongue some they're good
at<00:04:39.880> something<00:04:40.090> can<00:04:40.690> go<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> lot<00:04:41.230> long<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.650> lot

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
at something can go a lot long a lot

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.970 
at something can go a lot long a lot
farther<00:04:42.370> away<00:04:42.640> than<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.420> think<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.470> yeah<00:04:44.740> I

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
farther away than you think so yeah I

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.100 
farther away than you think so yeah I
guess<00:04:45.520> what<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:45.790> would<00:04:45.850> address<00:04:46.120> mr.<00:04:46.930> t-jet

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
guess what I would address mr. t-jet

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.930 
guess what I would address mr. t-jet
