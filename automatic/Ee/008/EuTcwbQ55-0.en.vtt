suite of icons this tool lets you sweep
a<00:00:09.250> shape<00:00:09.490> along<00:00:09.940> a<00:00:09.970> path<00:00:10.240> to<00:00:10.720> generate<00:00:11.110> a<00:00:11.200> solid

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
a shape along a path to generate a solid

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.970 
a shape along a path to generate a solid
or<00:00:11.770> a<00:00:11.830> surface<00:00:12.310> object<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:14.410> we<00:00:14.620> need<00:00:14.800> is<00:00:14.950> a

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
or a surface object all we need is a

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.310 
or a surface object all we need is a
source<00:00:15.340> shape<00:00:15.760> and<00:00:16.059> a<00:00:16.359> path<00:00:16.630> for<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.080> source

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
source shape and a path for the source

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.920 
source shape and a path for the source
to<00:00:17.530> follow<00:00:17.740> let's<00:00:18.700> create<00:00:18.970> a<00:00:19.090> source<00:00:19.450> shape<00:00:19.720> by

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
to follow let's create a source shape by

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.660 
to follow let's create a source shape by
using<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.380> vector<00:00:20.530> line<00:00:20.830> drawing<00:00:21.160> tool<00:00:21.400> and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
using the vector line drawing tool and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.820 
using the vector line drawing tool and
creating<00:00:22.449> a<00:00:22.570> 2d<00:00:23.050> shape<00:00:25.350> next<00:00:26.350> we'll<00:00:26.529> create

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
creating a 2d shape next we'll create

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.769 
creating a 2d shape next we'll create
the<00:00:27.100> path<00:00:27.340> for<00:00:27.699> the<00:00:27.789> source<00:00:28.210> shape<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.570> follow

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
the path for the source shape to follow

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.740 
the path for the source shape to follow
let's<00:00:29.680> use<00:00:29.859> the<00:00:29.980> spline<00:00:30.340> drawing<00:00:30.670> tool<00:00:30.910> and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
let's use the spline drawing tool and

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.419 
let's use the spline drawing tool and
we'll<00:00:31.930> create<00:00:32.109> a<00:00:32.259> smooth<00:00:32.800> spline<00:00:33.219> curve<00:00:35.429> now

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
we'll create a smooth spline curve now

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.029 
we'll create a smooth spline curve now

this<00:00:46.659> will<00:00:46.839> take<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.139> source<00:00:47.379> shape<00:00:47.589> and

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
this will take the source shape and

now let's look in the tool options

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.060 
now let's look in the tool options

for example this rotate option which is

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.080 
for example this rotate option which is
different<00:01:42.010> from<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.220> rotate<00:01:42.580> we<00:01:42.700> performed

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
different from the rotate we performed

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.780 
different from the rotate we performed
earlier<00:01:43.420> this<00:01:44.110> rotates<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.890> source<00:01:45.190> from<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
earlier this rotates the source from the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.230 
earlier this rotates the source from the
start<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.480> end<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.590> path<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:49.060> the

and inserting a segment from the bottom

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.790 
and inserting a segment from the bottom
let's<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.519> second<00:03:11.850> time<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.800> then

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
let's do this the second time and then

that shape will sweep along that path

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.090 
that shape will sweep along that path
and<00:06:12.229> there's<00:06:13.229> our<00:06:13.380> crown<00:06:13.650> molding<00:06:13.979> that

to bring the other object back we can do

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.350 
to bring the other object back we can do
a<00:06:20.810> command<00:06:21.810> V<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.290> Mac<00:06:23.010> or<00:06:23.310> ctrl<00:06:23.970> V<00:06:24.150> and

windows to paste that object back into
our<00:06:27.000> scene<00:06:27.300> and<00:06:29.330> this<00:06:30.330> concludes<00:06:30.570> sweep
