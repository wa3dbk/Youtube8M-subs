taylormade's new jet speed range of
metal<00:00:07.140> woods<00:00:07.379> was<00:00:07.620> launched<00:00:07.859> right<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
metal woods was launched right at the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.910 
metal woods was launched right at the
end<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.760> 2013<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.380> know<00:00:10.440> they're<00:00:10.740> going<00:00:10.830> to

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
end of 2013 and I know they're going to

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.120 
end of 2013 and I know they're going to
be<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> very<00:00:11.160> popular<00:00:11.400> line<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.740> 2014<00:00:13.740> they

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
be a very popular line for 2014 they

be a very popular line for 2014 they
replace<00:00:14.549> rocketballz<00:00:15.480> stage<00:00:15.599> two<00:00:16.289> which<00:00:16.529> i

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
replace rocketballz stage two which i

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
replace rocketballz stage two which i
think<00:00:17.100> was<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:18.090> top<00:00:18.300> performing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
think was a a really top performing

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
think was a a really top performing
product<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> lot<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.010> those<00:00:20.609> yellow<00:00:21.000> head

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
product so a lot of those yellow head

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.150 
product so a lot of those yellow head
covers<00:00:21.539> out<00:00:21.720> there<00:00:21.930> last<00:00:22.080> year<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.830> I'm<00:00:22.949> sure

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
covers out there last year and I'm sure

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
covers out there last year and I'm sure
we'll<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.400> similar<00:00:23.910> numbers<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.449> jet<00:00:24.960> speed

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
we'll see similar numbers of jet speed

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.330 
we'll see similar numbers of jet speed
and<00:00:25.439> play<00:00:25.619> from<00:00:25.859> Club<00:00:26.099> golfers<00:00:26.630> jet<00:00:27.630> speed<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
and play from Club golfers jet speed is

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.250 
and play from Club golfers jet speed is
slightly<00:00:29.340> more<00:00:29.490> affordable<00:00:30.210> than<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.599> SLDR

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
slightly more affordable than the SLDR

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.280 
slightly more affordable than the SLDR
range<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.480> more<00:00:33.660> forgiving<00:00:34.170> as

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
range and it's a bit more forgiving as

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.680 
range and it's a bit more forgiving as
well<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:35.430> easy<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.910> launch<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> I've<00:00:36.450> got

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
well really easy to launch and I've got

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.810 
well really easy to launch and I've got
the<00:00:36.719> fairway<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.350> hybrid<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.550> both

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the fairway and hybrid here they both

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.470 
the fairway and hybrid here they both
feature<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:40.020> speed<00:00:40.320> pocket<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.270> which<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
feature the speed pocket here which of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840 
feature the speed pocket here which of
course<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.870> saw<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> first<00:00:43.410> time<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
course we saw for the first time in the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.049 
course we saw for the first time in the
original<00:00:45.059> rocketballz<00:00:45.930> fairway<00:00:46.890> woods<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
original rocketballz fairway woods and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
original rocketballz fairway woods and
hybrids<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.200> obviously<00:00:49.379> helps

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
hybrids and that obviously helps

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.180 
hybrids and that obviously helps
maximize<00:00:51.140> distance<00:00:52.140> off<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> face<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.949> gives

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
maximize distance off the face it gives

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.060 
maximize distance off the face it gives
maximum<00:00:53.910> light<00:00:54.329> spring-like<00:00:55.050> effect<00:00:55.469> but

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
maximum light spring-like effect but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.430 
maximum light spring-like effect but
really<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.199> speed

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
really as you can see that the the speed

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360 
really as you can see that the the speed
pocket<00:00:58.859> has<00:00:59.010> been<00:00:59.390> changed<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.140> design<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
pocket has been changed the design of it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.889 
pocket has been changed the design of it
and<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.910> helps<00:01:03.300> particularly<00:01:03.840> if

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and that really helps particularly if

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.750 
and that really helps particularly if
you're<00:01:03.960> missing<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> ball<00:01:04.680> either<00:01:05.189> low<00:01:05.580> on

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
you're missing the ball either low on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.600 
you're missing the ball either low on
the<00:01:05.880> face<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.420> left<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> will

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the face or left and right and that will

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
the face or left and right and that will
certainly<00:01:08.820> help<00:01:09.090> still<00:01:09.630> give<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> good

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
certainly help still give you good

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770 
certainly help still give you good
performance<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.909> forgiving<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.540> well

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
performance but very forgiving as well

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.460 
performance but very forgiving as well
so<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.680> technology<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.869> jet

things<00:01:24.299> you'll<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.659> notice<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> courses

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
things you'll really notice the courses

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
things you'll really notice the courses
having<00:01:26.070> seen<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.549> white<00:01:26.939> crowns<00:01:27.390> the

taylormade have produced for the four

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.910 
taylormade have produced for the four
last<00:01:30.750> few<00:01:31.020> years<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
last few years that this is a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.179 
last few years that this is a
traditional<00:01:32.610> matte<00:01:33.540> black<00:01:33.869> cloud<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:35.159> a

traditional matte black cloud with a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.100 
traditional matte black cloud with a
really<00:01:35.610> nice<00:01:35.790> alignment<00:01:36.150> aid<00:01:36.479> quite<00:01:36.780> subtle

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
really nice alignment aid quite subtle

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
really nice alignment aid quite subtle
almost<00:01:37.890> reminds<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> burner

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
almost reminds me of the of the burner

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
almost reminds me of the of the burner
series<00:01:39.840> from<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> few<00:01:40.259> years<00:01:40.409> ago<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:41.520> good

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
series from a few years ago really good

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.370 
series from a few years ago really good
to<00:01:41.700> look<00:01:41.939> down<00:01:42.150> at<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.689> struggled<00:01:43.170> with

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to look down at so if you struggled with

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.679 
to look down at so if you struggled with
getting<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.549> look<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.240> white-headed

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
getting on with a look of a white-headed

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.800 
getting on with a look of a white-headed
driver<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.829> metal<00:01:47.369> woods<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.540> jet

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
driver and metal woods then I think jet

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
driver and metal woods then I think jet
speed<00:01:49.079> will<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.619> appealing<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
speed will be really appealing to you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.929 
speed will be really appealing to you
very<00:01:50.820> competitive<00:01:51.090> price<00:01:51.720> point<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.159> fairway

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
very competitive price point the fairway

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.120 
very competitive price point the fairway
and<00:01:54.000> hybrid<00:01:54.390> are<00:01:54.509> actually<00:01:54.930> cheaper<00:01:55.439> than

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and hybrid are actually cheaper than

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
and hybrid are actually cheaper than
rocketballz<00:01:56.939> stage<00:01:57.030> two<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:57.810> it's
