00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.490
 hello good morning I'm javier down 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.680
 training department of the fiat group 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.839
 and we are going to previously excellences 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.499
 more important than this engine that 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.139
 Mount in the Grand Cherokee 2014 is a 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:17.400
 motor 3,000 cubic centimeters with 190 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 or 250 horses v6 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.720
 that equips among other things had the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.090
 variable geometry compressor with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.950
 electronic module direct injection of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 diesel fuel with injectors 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.119
 electrohydraulic up to a pressure 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.250
 maximum of 2,000 bars brought to the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.410
 edge cams in head that of course 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 complies with the euro 5 and euro 5 plus regulations 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.449
 which is equipped with catalyst probe 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.110
 landa and pf filter and that is capable of 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.239
 drag up to 3500 kilos of weight 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.329
 our next engine is a 3600 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.570
 gasoline penta starter 286 version 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.879
 horses that equips 4 camshafts 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.890
 with phase variators both in the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.830
 emission as in escape the biggest phases 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.449
 what they do is modify forward or 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.309
 delay the opening of the valves 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.780
 admission and escape with the aim of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.960
 fill cylinders better 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.180
 All the motor is aluminum equip too 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.799
 the integrated exhaust manifolds 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.570
 directly on the stock with the 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.060
 goal of fundamentally reducing 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.210
 weight is an engine that of course cooper 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.610
 to euro5 regulation and is equipped to 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.979
 flexifuel work with the flexifuel is 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.840
 uses a lot in america and is a 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.020
 fuel that is equipped that 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.720
 contains gasoline and ethanol to finish 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.049
 with gasoline engines tell you that 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.649
 we have two v8 engines of 5 thousand 700 and 6 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.160
 thousand 400 cubic centimeters that give 352 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.880
 horses and 470 horsepower 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.380
 regarding the gearbox 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.750
 tell them that it is made in Germany 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.119
 by zf is a gearbox of 8 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.399
 speeds with four trips and 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.100
 ideal principles leads converter 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.039
 pair of course shift control at the time 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.560
 to change from changing the gears so 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.380
 only weighs 91 kilos is a very 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.149
 fast progressive reduces the consumption of 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.649
 fuel 11 percent and in the 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.250
 gearbox that is riding the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.060
 most elitist brands 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.320
 audi bmw etcetera well as for the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.520
 traction system of this vehicle 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.070
 the 4x4 system is of course a 4x4 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.050
 permanent asset and depending on the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.750
 finish of the vehicle can carry the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.740
 quadra trac 2 system or system 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.030
 quadra drive 2 this system is the most 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.130
 advanced that there is currently in the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.840
 market and the most modern in terms of 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.680
 4x4 traction system that equip the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.900
 all terrain vehicles 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.580
 the select system terrain that mounts 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.459
 our great cherokee has five 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.489
 work positions the first snow 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.580
 the second sand the third the position 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.430
 automatic the fourth mud and the fourth and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.190
 the fifth position rocks the difference 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.900
 fundamental that there is with the previous one is 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.730
 that we had the sport position too 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.550
 incorporated and now it has been mounted on the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.190
 own shift lever 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.740
 The suspension system is pneumatic 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.880
 flame suspension system quadra lift 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.010
 is related to the system 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.360
 traction means that depending on 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.220
 the position that I place the lever 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.440
 of the select terrain the car is going to have 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.060
 a height or other reference to the ground and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.960
 right now it is the most balanced system 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.850
 what's on the market in terms of 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.370
 suspension systems related to 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.500
 the creation of 4x4 vehicles for 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.490
 conclude and briefly comment on 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.320
 electrical system that the one that carries the 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.620
 vehicle equips three work networks 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.120
 a high-speed cam network for the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.220
 supply and dynamic control of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.620
 vehicle engine gearbox one 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.000
 second network that is called and hs of minor 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.960
 speed for everything that is a reference 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.450
 to 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.610
 the opening closing of doors lights 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.930
 etcetera and then a third network that 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.210
 call red link that is for the subject of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.340
 diagnosis this is the lineage of 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.960
 excellence that this car has what 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.300
 important would be to ask and 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.100
 debating a reference to the system of 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.960
 suspension referring to engine system 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.150
 to the traction system to know in 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.780
 depth the excellences that it has 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.780
 this vehicle
