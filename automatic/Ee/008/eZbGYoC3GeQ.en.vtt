00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello to everything today this is the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.330
 back from the panic nail art since yesterday 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.550
 evening I was inspired to actually do 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.679
 nail a panic nail art these 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.269
 fully realized nails auvergne 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.519
 years with technique and varnish 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.900
 watercolor with lots of peas 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.900
 multicolored it's nice enough 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.810
 we start by asking a 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.480
 base and black it works only on 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.850
 black or extremely dark varnish 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.020
 I choose colored varnishes as well as 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.570
 transparent varnish 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.770
 8 'mates then two hens 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.090
 different sykes size 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.430
 do not forget that you can do with 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.620
 toothpicks hair clips all 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.780
 object that is sharp or oral at the end 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.550
 then on my black base which is 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.350
 dry I'm going to draw lots of little 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.610
 points so what you want you 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.320
 of course do not have to do 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.629
 weight you can draw flowers 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.640
 make lines what you want so much 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.750
 that it is with white varnish that this 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.680
 in white so that the colors 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.680
 then comes out 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 so I do that in full on the finger 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.510
 and on the offers must not that it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.060
 to make too much load I just did a 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.350
 reminder on one side of the nail like that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.350
 crescent shaped 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.450
 then I will apply the varnishes 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.250
 color on my palette and mix them up to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 clear transparent varnish of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.610
 way to create very very colors 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 very transparent really not at all 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.630
 packs so a little like the oph 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.890
 higgins if you have them you can 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.990
 use elsewhere it's to knicks 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.360
 have done so on purpose so I mix 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.770
 but varnish and this is the difficulty there 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.550
 do not make polishes that are 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.800
 too opaque 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.150
 because otherwise it will cover by 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.100
 above black and it's not going to be very 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.260
 pretty it 'll do a little burrs so 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 I apply these varnishes in task by 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.310
 white mont blanc careful not to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.229
 iron many times with the brush 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.270
 on top otherwise the white will drool 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.810
 so I apply them a little bit as 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.369
 it by color keys in places 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.700
 so I do the same on the others 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.920
 fingers 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 there you will see that my orange I 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.550
 did not say enough naked and so you 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.280
 see that a little bit covered 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.200
 covered covered by whose black 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.470
 so that's why it's 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.120
 a little smoke indeed like that so 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.020
 then I clean the outlines 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.550
 I apply my top coat and it's finished 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.230
 so with all these layers of varnish 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.930
 stacked on top of each other but 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.550
 Round have not warped slightly 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.410
 did not stay very round but precisely 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.640
 I really liked this effect so 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.260
 I hope you too 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 you liked that you will try again 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.470
 ring the arte why not with 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.940
 something other than points I can not wait to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.920
 see your inventions 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.180
 I hope this panic but there you 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.660
 call the needs and you friday 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.080

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.080
 see you soon
