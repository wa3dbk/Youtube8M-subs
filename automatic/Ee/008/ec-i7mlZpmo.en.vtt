00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.950
 hello today we are going to do the 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.759
 stroke for our straight pants to the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.980
 waist what we will need to do 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.590
 revolution if they do not have revolution can 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 be any kind of paper 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.640
 let's use a rule l 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.009
 and a color pencil or pencil of any 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.009
 color the measures that we will need are 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.260
 well let's start drawing the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.719
 rectangle 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.309
 of the fourth hip for the length of 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.559
 our pants have to leave a 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.460
 space in the part of aquino and shore 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.460
 about 10 centimeters 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.430
 and in the top part also about 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.559
 5 to 10 centimeters and we trace passed 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.010
 our rectangle completely a 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.010
 rectangle 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.690
 ready now what we are going to do is 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.369
 mark our chain we get off 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.000
 I have long chain 20 we mark 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.000
 we look for a line 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.590
 and we already have a single angle marking the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.660
 hip in the part of the waist we are going to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.660
 mark our fourth waist 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.220
 plus three centimeters for the clamp 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.570
 this is so they can see where our 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.520
 part of the waist however I do 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.990
 I will leave completely rectangular 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.790
 because I want you to have a little bit of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.470
 subsidy waist I'm not going to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.470
 do this this is in case they want 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.990
 you mark your brush and sew it in 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.140
 time to leave them oscyl good if we do not 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.750
 a rectangle is completely 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.990
 our long shot I in this case a 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.789
 light and I do not have 27 and we're going to go down 2 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.700
 centimeters more so I'll be left 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.710
 of 29 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.700
 to the front I'm going to leave 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.720
 6 centimeters and I'm going to upload a half 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.640
 simple 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 and what we're going to do is hip 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.569
 here we are going to do 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.569
 a small 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.250
 of the dry chain I make the union and we 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.040
 there is a small curve remember that 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.200
 we are doing this pattern 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.150
 a little bit of transformations that the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.820
 normal basic because we're going to make a 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.340
 wide leg pants at the waist 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.230
 with a little plastic waist and what 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.880
 that gives an interest we will go out in the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.720
 bottom of our length of 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.670
 trousers in the ring 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.310
 we left about 5 centimeters 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.010
 you have to measure the width that we have here 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.569
 to see if this year is the one we want if 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.250
 we want a little bit wider 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.380
 we can use a little more here 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.989
 or we do not leave here depending on the 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.670
 wide that we do not have much talk or 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.660
 very on the other side that we stay focused 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.890
 our screen wide door what 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.890
 what we are going to do is unite 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.440
 if they are 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.930
 our front and this would be 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.849
 the whole front we do not occupy 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.489
 fixed there is not much transformation in the 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.519
 front pattern and we mark our 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.769
 quarter of hip again for the long 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.459
 of our pants we would have another 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.440
 rectangle ready we have the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.890
 rectangle we mark the door equal 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.890
 hip 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.030
 let's do then our shot 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.290
 we mark our long shot plus two 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.040
 centimeters I have 27 29 meters and here what 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.430
 what we are going to do is get out 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.170
 from 10 to 12 centimeters this this is going to 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.379
 depend on the size of the pants that 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.259
 let's be like this and here instead of going up we're going 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.070
 to come down with senses and now if we do 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.070
 our curve 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.500
 that does not remain very pronounced to them 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.500
 stay a little 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.950
 Here we're going to get three to five 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.889
 centimeters this will depend on the 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.199
 body type 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.409
 remember to study the transformations 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.240
 further and that depends on the type 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.969
 of cuts why you want pants 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.379
 and the body of each person and we go 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:52.870
 to go up from 5 to 6 centimeters and we mark 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.870
 our square from the point of the hip 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.010
 and what you got in your waist here 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.440
 I got four centimeters let's go out 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.169
 in the same part here the four 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.169
 centimeters and we open the colon 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.120
 hours 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.730
 and tells our employer that a little 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.490
 more inclined this is with the part of the 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.360
 return pomp 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.330
 but what we're going to do is get out 4 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.150
 we want it completely straight we're going to 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.520
 close it 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.530
 to finish three like here I left 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.340
 four nothing but a little bit that is going to 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.540
 put not much 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.910
 or leave it completely straight 4 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.940
 from here we will take out the same as 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.020
 we take out in the front 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.020
 and we unite 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.300
 fix here we get more out though 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.520
 our shot you in the part of here 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.440
 wider so that our leg 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.660
 we do not get too wide we are going to 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.190
 have a bit wider in the part 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.350
 back that the whole but for stretches 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:08.090
 that is so wide and here what we are going to 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:11.420
 to do is get off 20 from 15 to 20 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.120
 centimeters or 25 depending on the 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.910
 size and let's make an inch 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.980
 we put in and make a small curve this 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.470
 so where more form in the pomp 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.700
 especially if they have a lot of pomp 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:28.010
 buttock this or back should be done 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.630
 The more back you have a little bit 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.080
 more you have to put them so that we do not 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.910
 it is so short at the top and 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.320
 If you want to mark the clamp , 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.270
 brand 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.630
 just take into account the line that 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.250
 we did are here from above and they mark their 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.200
 I 'm going to mark it, just in case 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.840
 Who do we left the 9 or 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.720
 depending on the taste separation and 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.230
 we mark a 1 and a half and we make our 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.030
 clip 12 centimeters long this is 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.330
 if they want to make it for the pants 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.330
 straight 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.820
 with elastic at the waist but 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.190
 they need at least not to want 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:10.330
 put elastic nothing else do this and 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:11.979
 they remove the centimeters in the waist 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.780
 Well, we were ready for our 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:18.909
 pattern straight pants waist the 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.550
 next Tuesday we will see how to cut 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:24.069
 and confection to our pants if they 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.050
