00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.969 
sent to the hardware store and bought
several<00:01:26.909> different<00:01:27.150> pieces<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.979> chain-link

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
several different pieces of chain-link

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.630 
several different pieces of chain-link
of<00:01:29.130> different<00:01:29.460> sizes<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.049> bars<00:01:31.340> no<00:01:32.340> hooks

just<00:01:33.540> hook<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.770> reason<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
just hook it right on the reason that I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
just hook it right on the reason that I
like<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> chain<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.170> actually

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
like the chain is that you can actually

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
like the chain is that you can actually
adjust<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.950> obviously<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.909> about

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
adjust it obviously you know it's about

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.770 
adjust it obviously you know it's about
an<00:01:39.210> inch<00:01:39.409> shorter<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.530> higher<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.630> your

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
an inch shorter or higher you have your

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
in addition to that I also recommend if

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.420 
in addition to that I also recommend if
you<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.970> whole<00:02:26.180> overhead<00:02:26.840> bar<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.980> get<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
you have the whole overhead bar to get a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.090 
you have the whole overhead bar to get a
some<00:02:29.000> extract<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.020> can<00:02:30.230> hold<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
some extract so that you can hold the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.680 
some extract so that you can hold the
dog's<00:02:31.310> hips<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.730> place<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.120> keep<00:02:32.270> them<00:02:32.450> from

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
dog's hips in place to keep them from

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.860 
dog's hips in place to keep them from
walking<00:02:32.930> off<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.410> table<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:35.360> actually

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
walking off the table this actually

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.750 
walking off the table this actually
happens<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.410> just<00:02:36.590> an<00:02:36.800> old<00:02:37.040> luggage<00:02:37.310> strap

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
happens to be just an old luggage strap

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.180 
happens to be just an old luggage strap
that<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.000> had<00:02:38.210> works<00:02:39.110> really<00:02:39.380> well<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.710> has<00:02:39.740> lips

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.550 
that I had works really well it has lips
on<00:02:40.340> both<00:02:40.550> sides<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.240> it's<00:02:42.170> actually

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
on both sides and it's actually

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.200 
on both sides and it's actually
adjustable<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.430> make<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.700> shorter<00:02:44.060> or

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
adjustable so I can make it shorter or

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.370 
adjustable so I can make it shorter or
longer<00:02:44.240> if<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.750> need<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.550> just<00:02:46.550> clip<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.120> on

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
longer if I need to I just clip that on

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.210 
longer if I need to I just clip that on
put<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.500> around<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.070> dog's<00:02:49.250> stomach<00:02:51.100> look<00:02:52.100> it

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
put it around the dog's stomach look it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100 
put it around the dog's stomach look it
on<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> other<00:02:52.550> side<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:53.390> can<00:02:53.420> also<00:02:53.720> put<00:02:54.020> your

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
on the other side you can also put your

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.840 
on the other side you can also put your
chain<00:02:54.410> link<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.010> hook<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.280> if<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.550> need<00:02:55.700> it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
chain link up and hook it if you need it

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.110 
chain link up and hook it if you need it
and<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.810> be<00:02:56.959> closer<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> ground<00:02:58.910> and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
and to be closer to to the ground and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.699 
and to be closer to to the ground and
that<00:02:59.180> really<00:02:59.690> just<00:02:59.840> prevents<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.320> dog<00:03:00.500> from

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
that really just prevents the dog from

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.880 
that really just prevents the dog from
walking<00:03:01.100> off<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.670> table
