 in 1909 and now indicate turbines of the company adeje 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.879
 being a precedent to processes linked to industrial activity 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:26.069
 It not only designs the factory but transcends the other type of experiences 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.180
 which is from the point of view of practical innovation and 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:34.009
 intervention of these nationalist principles the construction of the 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:37.009
 first model of the corporate image of the company 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.939
 which is a graphic identity that is used throughout the visual apparatus 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.199
 pioneer press 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.199
 in order to consolidate an image in the market 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.899
 puel hitcher school 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:52.629
 founded in 1907 at minimum

 mex architects artists and industrialists 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.629
 its objective was to increase the competitiveness of germany 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.019
 against productive powers like the united states and the goal 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.299
 strengthening a multidisciplinary foundation the design that is 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.459
 consolidates with the school thanks to the intervention of a set of knowledge 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.160
 where each one generates a concrete contribution 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.199
 and that when consolidating the idea of ​​a common design is conceived and has structure 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.370
 that intervenes with the cinemas of the artisan processes and you 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.860
 I make 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.009
 there is a first stage are 1934 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.180
 there was a break in his activities in 1918 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.770
 for the costs in the industry due to the First World War 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.419
 and was re-established after the Second World War in 1950 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.220
 one of his most representative works 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.809
 it was the theater of the body 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:55.990
 built by people ohlander p 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.729
 1914 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.240
 which was destroyed due to the war in germany by nationalist intention 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.790
 in the same year the glass house was built in colonies 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.949
 for now 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.460
 for a successful exhibition 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.539
 besides being a successful function of the technical aesthetic elements and 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.999
 commercial of the 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:21.399
 the interior was built with glass floors and the walls and windows the 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:22.099
 mosaic 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.469
 where an exhibition of information about the av is included 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.469
 sponsors of the hiv industry project 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.460
 and the model factory in the exhibition of said meeting 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.059
 designed by walter gropius 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:38.059
 among the highlights this one 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.730
 the electric kettle in 1909 designed by interpeñas 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.740
 the valsain cookie pack in 1914 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.770
 designed by 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.189
 hyperber 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:54.449
 german reech in 1931 iso the design of the table and serbian 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.969
 and coffee service and 1958 taca puerco 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.979
 expressing the simplification and being tender of the objects and form 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.669
 the most representative architects of the port agreement 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:13.689
 well in 1876 germany and died in 1950 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.699
 I thought that the decisive thing is always the same gas 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.699
 being another reference of the functionalism of the web 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.219
 the bel divan was born in 1863 begic 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.439
 and he died in 1957 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.869
 I thought that all the arts of gansu swoop to the decorative arts 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.930
 since improving the environment of man 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.169
 the man improves 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.860
 for that reason designed to the last detail of his swords
