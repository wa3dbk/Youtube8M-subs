00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.810
 midfield 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.810
 percent I tell the players that 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.420
 the ball must always be pressed 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.420
 but that they choose where they start to press it 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.240
 an ideal world 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.220
 I would like 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.360
 tito players will press the whole track and what 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.259
 this out let's go 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.890
 fantastic the reality is that you can not always or can not push the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 one hundred percent of the time one hundred percent of the space 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.910
 then you have to wait in the midfield line 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.890
 nothing happens, what I say is that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.170
 if you can 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.620
 start defending by pressing the ball 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.850
 in the midfield line 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.190
 Paez Sanz 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.250
 do it and do not do it here 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.330
 because it is a little more comfortable 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.400
 I know that 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.760
 Ideally, I would start on the three point line 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.929
 anywhere 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.810
 that is put to defend then 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.260
 good for what we are doing is 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.680
 you have to defend here 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.650
 you start 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.370
 very important defending the ball you have to always be between the ball 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.200
 if he is pyram lyricist dribbling 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.960
 if you are weak nono 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 and you are 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 because you are not between the ball and the hoop 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760
 if you are 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.380
 not because it is worth to be on this side and you are not between side ball 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.320
 Your man 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 and the bird do not have to be 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.549
 defending here 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.400
 you have to have a side 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.620
 of protection a strong side 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.990
 -serves there 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.370
 I feel comfortable here 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.060
 I'm a side where I'm less strong so he goes to the other side of camps 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 on the other hand, button stopped I protected myself and continued 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.770
 never 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.760
 I defend 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.790
 because so 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.890
 the two sides are equally weak sometimes there are not on both sides always 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.929
 I try to be 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.770
 between the ball carry or 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.800
 I give it a side 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.330
 tactically we can talk about it being the left feels less charged 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.930
 I do not care 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 if what I want is that always in front of him other 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.329
 the one pass always the same instance for cameron 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.199
 always the same distance 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.719
 so that you take confidence 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.369
 what we do is what 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.660
 you start 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.660
 from here if you want you start it a little higher up defend it 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.269
 when you give a pot inside itself 25 separates 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.089
 it's as if you were going to pass 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.209
 for peace 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.789
 phelps do not get 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.809
 such a side tablado there is pity 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.119
 we are making progress 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.949
 good still 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.820
 very well very well follow 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.709
 will arrive with him 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.690
 very good these do not throw you do not have why if you throw and the letters 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.279
 he is going to think that he has done badly and he has done very well 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.519
 but another more beautiful couple 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.850
 come on, take what you've got to take higher 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.069
 peragon one side give a side 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.289
 just to stop 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.289
 Give it a side does not mean that you stand next to it 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.709
 ok give it a side what we do want here 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.699
 because then you're not fulfilling the rule that you have to be between 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.199
 hoop ball means that 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.079
 you put here 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.549
 and now you're nullified and the vote there 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.439
 if you vote the other side that you know what he's going to do 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.439
 pop went from fall and you try as soon as you can get plugs in front of the 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:18.449
 ball 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.449
 but very good good distance very well very well 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.509
 very good very good 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:25.720
 this perfect 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.890
 not by hand so why are you going to make a mistake try to make it worse 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.239
 higher possible already we stopped it came very well has done very well 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.289
 then up we have up 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.159
 there 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.159
 very good very good 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.499
 for this 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.809
 to then 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.489
 with this type of exercises 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.489
 that are not of great physical demand but 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.049
 what we have to ask them is that they technically make it perfect 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.950
 if they are always with a good distance 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.849
 short steps 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.599
 always ahead what the main problem with this kind of thing is 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.549
 that the player costs 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.549
 between the ball of the hoop looks like 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.909
 let me go giving 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.669
 defending could not 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.150
 if I'm here the good touch the vote here 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.439
 I'm staying here 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.609
 as a traveler aquino 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.059
 I'm not between the ball of the hoop 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.059
 if I do not defend the body but I defend value 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:29.909
 of the underline concept 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.840
 always be in defense of ball treball el aro 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.349
 why is this concept so important 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.830
 because when I do not defend the ball 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.759
 the main defect of defensive positions 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.460
 when I do not defend the ball 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.240
 many players have the tendency up 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.750
 between his attacker and the hoop 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.920
 it's always a bad defensive position 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.680
 but to the attackers more 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.680
 two more attackers 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.020
 imagine what 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.400
 you are there with the ball 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.550
 you attack put where you want I do not choose a position in attack 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:09.730
 many players 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.129
 if he is attacking 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.129
 his most natural defensive position is 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.319
 between the attacker 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.470
 if we want to have an aggressive defense a defense like positions 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.190
 defensive 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.580
 I have to be 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.490
 between my man 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.860
 and the value 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.439
 that is my defensive position 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.020
 not here back 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.270
 because if I'm here back 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.150
 I'm not defining the pass line 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.639
 not here 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.080
 because I'm not in the right position and may be late for help 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.990
 so 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.990
 forever 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.229
 must think 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.379
 the perfect defense of positions being the four players who do not defend the 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.999
 ball 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.289
 forever 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.139
 between 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.349
 his man and the hoop and then for him the player you want 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.180
 I do not know what he plays in power 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.180
 is attacking in the low post 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.389
 bad position 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:05.699
 good position 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.830
 the farther this 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.740
 my man with the ball 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.050
 more if the triangle were of eayo 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.639
 and I'm in this position 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.580
 it's worth it 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.580
 the value is striking zacate 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.330
 i would be closer but 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
 not between my man taken 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.610
 Some will be thinking 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.400
 is that doing this defense 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.680
 It is very easy to lose sight of my man 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.919
 or if I am here 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.819
 photo little more back 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.090
 I'm in this position 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.730
 it's very easy, move, move 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.039
 that I do not see it and I do not see it and that right where it is 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.839
 and that you lose sight of that can happen 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.549
 you can only succeed by making this defense if the value is 

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:53.960
 held down 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.300
 silva is not pressed 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.680
 if he is not pressing the ball 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.619
 attack from here 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:02.529
 and I am 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:05.529
 in a good position I did not press it banking topics for back 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.319
 there are important as well as with the arms concealing that it seems that you are 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.009
 defending 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:11.669
 and you are not seeing everything 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:12.749
 move poblete 

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:15.409
 pass the saving ball 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:16.839
 the vote 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.129
 instead 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:19.759
 what we have to understand 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.919
 and that's why it's a team defense 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.349
 I take a good position of cc has pressed a lot 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:28.819
 if it is to press the pota bota boot 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.819
 we go itata pass it on you go over the 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:34.899
 and the pass was not the same as he said before the previous time 

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:36.909
 because the ball was pressed 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:38.379
 so 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:41.379
 you have to understand that all door situations after 

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:45.169
 that it seems you're wrong 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.740
 only by the dirty aseval is pressed if we do not pass the ball 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.889
 there is nothing to do going to be a defense 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:52.360
 with little success 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.339
 it's a bit forgotten 

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:54.989
 percent
