00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.640
 So let's talk a little about the 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.070
 game now and there how's the game time 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.980
 sound taking place on the board with two 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.290
 times do not have two games together and how 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.270
 the defense attack works then the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.410
 attack 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.270
 basically with the pocket you can pass the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.670
 side or back 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.170
 it works like a ball in the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.660
 diagonal of the field 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.890
 so the car is always attacking that 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.380
 will pass the ball is behind you 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.200
 because you lose the ball at speed 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.230
 it has to have a reaction time to the 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.270
 defender stands in front of him 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.730
 hence he is right when he is behind and 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.950
 can handle the general case this ball is 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.320
 past apportioning player who is behind 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.119
 to get the ball to hit as you 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.710
 he will pass the line of impediment 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.229
 my you can go forward 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.999
 reaching the maximum speed 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.619
 At that moment we have a defense that 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.420
 stands in front 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.340
 the guy stopped in a car in acceleration 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.810
 the guy is not going to get the car then the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.179
 defender is moving to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.119
 receive or wait for this guy in 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.100
 speed and the ball goes to the side 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.899
 field we have a five-line 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.179
 players there then the ball goes from 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.249
 one to the other until you reach the 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.530
 in general when arriving at the tip the person 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:36.109
 will contact the opponent will 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.179
 position the ball behind a player 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.920
 which is nearer valim father the guy 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.509
 who is defending the ball entered today 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.030
 dude , he's in the front row, he's going 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.319
 push the guy off the field that 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.090
 there will be a third person going 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.200
 to continue the game is to take the ball off the ground 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.429
 and continue one step further 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.409
 contrary 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.909
 so every line of attack she is 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.109
 positioning on one side and it will 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.200
 reverse exactly what we call a wing 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.659
 it goes as bad as that and it's natural that 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.979
 movement, which is more important 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.479
 distance of the player who will receive 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.340
 ball is one meter and a half and two meters 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.899
 back when he gets the ball he goes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.480
 tinkling and speed 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.210
 Then it goes easy for the defense then to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.190
 who is better to stay 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.440
 Our heads are talking. 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.180
 and we expect the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.280
 skinny face so it's in shape 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.140
 smaller guy also more agile to 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.120
 receive the ball and finish 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.340
 is an unfair situation because people 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.980
 I did not stay I'm a medium size 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.140
 great now but I size up 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.880
 strives a lot in defense to clean people 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.010
 enough ball people are involved in 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.990
 all situations of confrontation but in the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.970
 time to finish we are great 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.850
 the small faces guys more various 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.920
 houses that have more soccer skills 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.920
 down here to mark the code
