00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 President of Russia Finland 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.609
 those who met in Sochi declared that both 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.809
 countries are deeply concerned about the ongoing 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.730
 violence in the south-east of Ukraine called 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.340
 this is a humanitarian disaster which 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 should be resolved soon 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.119
 also the leader of finland supported 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 humanitarian operation being carried out now 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.779
 Moscow which sends to Ukraine 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.519
 humanitarian aid calling such steps 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.980
 confidence building in the region now what 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 just absolutely necessary 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 both presidents discussed and trade between 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.239
 Russia and Finland which in the last 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 time fell by 8 percent we with 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.579
 Mr President discussed this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 unfavorable development and I think that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.469
 sanctions adversely affect 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.780
 trade on business interest dynamics 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.329
 development of our countries end up on 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.250
 the whole world economy is the first 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.980
 Putin’s meeting with any of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.199
 European leaders after the last 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.739
 waves of sanctions imposed by European 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.870
 union 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.010
 aimed at whole sectors of the Russian 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.920
 economy moscow 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.950
 also introduced retaliatory sanctions either 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.680
 limiting or banning imports large 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.290
 parts of european products that caused 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.030
 strong blow to european 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.030
 the manufacturer predicts that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.290
 the European Union as a result already 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.560
 Russian retaliatory sanctions may 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.119
 lose up to seven billion dollars in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.460
 list of countries for which those sanctions 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.290
 influenced most are the netherlands 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.890
 which can lose up to 2 billion 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.829
 dollars 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.540
 lithuania which can lose about 1 and 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.409
 2 billion poland 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.900
 somewhere around 1 billion and Germany around 795 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.850
 million dollars many european 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.740
 farmers are now demanding compensation from 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.930
 European Union but the problem is that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.649
 special fund which for this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.310
 intended consists of only 400 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.960
 million euros which is clearly not enough 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.060
 I do not know what we will do if so 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 will go beyond the harvest of our region 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.890
 is at risk work for me 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.630
 people on the morning of August 11th I told you 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.390
 staying thinks not know how to me 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.000
 do not spoil the peaches on the left 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.770
 the situation is very difficult is the production 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.540
 brings great losses and we can’t 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.970
 will be able to compensate for them we do not get 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.440
 no 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.150
 open society from the government of Bulgaria 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.840
 There is no European Union for our company. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.580
 definitely will collapse does not mean 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.960
 we will have to stop 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.860
 because for the remaining 20 percent we 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.400
 not even such a trifle as 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.920
 bus people to collect around 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.300
 to get them accustomed to work also 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.950

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.590
 the european union held an emergency 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 meeting brussels but instead 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.270
 discuss how to help european 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.840
 the manufacturer, we again heard the new 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.700
 accusations against russia against moscow 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.320
 particulars that moscow uses 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.660
 humanitarian operation to cover 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.790
 other targets is a serious charge 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.320
 which by the way were not 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.720
 confirmed by specific
