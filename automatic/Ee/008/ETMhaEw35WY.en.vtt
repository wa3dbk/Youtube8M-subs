00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.139
 This theme is 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.959
 About practice method to develop technology in a short time in team 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.099
 School activities and I think I will explain 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.680
 Together with the club team 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.470
 If you are working on any technology 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.460
 If you are in trouble with the practice menu 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.419
 It is very recommended content 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.279
 I will try to explain the method immediately 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.649
 This time is a technology tied game match 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.681
 Play a game only with a specific technology or 

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.640
 Make a rule that you can not do it 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.710
 I will do something to play a match 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.890
 I think it is a bit difficult to understand 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 If you give me an example, for example, the back half 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.790
 Other than serving each other in the back half 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:14.310
 It's like playing a game all backhand 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:30.259
 is 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.850
 I did it from eight all right now 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.619
 Even if you do it from loveall 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.420
 I think that it is good at all still only backhand 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.360
 How to get points as you play a game 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.159
 I think I'm going to make mistakes so much concentration 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.700
 Because this is a game, it is a game 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.430
 A great concentration will be increased. 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.810
 The ability of the backhand to play a game 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.000
 It feels like going up at a stretch 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 I explained one to this example 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.700
 Let me introduce three of the rules that I recommend 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.400
 First of all I think 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.160
 It is a game to the fourth game to the fourth game 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.690
 What kind of content is this? 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.050
 If you have a serve, you have to hit the third ball 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.690
 It will be in the form of making sure to decide 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.800
 On the other hand, the side to receive the 4th ball on the receive side 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.330
 If you put the opponent's coat and block successfully and return the ball 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.650
 It is already said that it will definitely be a point 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.880
 The rule is to serve this by doing this 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.830
 Serve easy to hit the third ball gets stronger 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.090
 The accuracy power of the third ball and the range that you can hit will be expanded 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.050
 It is a form that you must decide in the third ball by all means 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.370
 Conversely, the receiving side is the third ball 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.890
 We devise a very receive that can not be beat 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.750
 Inventing and hitting 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.880
 Block power is also very strong 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.590
 Just serve this way and serve 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.920
 Receive 3rd ball to 4th ball 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.750
 A very important fast development in the game is 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.500
 The second way it gets very strong 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.220
 The second rule is a buzzing game 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.710
 This is a bench technology, especially receiving and flicking 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.010
 In the Chikita or aggressive receive 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.760
 It is recommended method for everybody working on 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.610
 From the first ball firmly without a stop or a spike 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.920
 Let's do everything with aggressive content 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.380
 Of course it will be a rule or stop 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.950
 If I do Tsutsuzuki, it will be a form of a loss at that point 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.580
 I think this is so simple and easy to understand 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.200
 The third rule is stop vs. stop 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.290
 If three or more stop vs. stop are continued 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.630
 It is a rule that it is ok to attack 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.540
 If you get out of the platform by three stops 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.030
 I will stop in the form of a goal 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.550
 Stop is on the receiving side 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.390
 If you think you're out of the rack, you can't touch it 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.060
 If you touch it, will it really come out? 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.840
 I don't know what it means so I miss it if I think it's out 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.320
 If it is out, it is a form of one's own point 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.980
 Practice of this rule is the accuracy of the stop first 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.330
 If you do not bounce 2 firmly 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.030
 Because it becomes the point of the other party, the accuracy of the stop is 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.810
 You will also find yourself and your opponent's stop 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.730
 It is the determination of the length When leaving the platform 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.660
 By doing something that you miss well 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.370
 This is the ball coming out of the table 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.420
 It will be so strong that when it comes to the actual game 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.530
 As this comes out, it can be attacked 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.240
 Judgment will be strong Three training menus this time 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.200
 It was introduced as a recommended practice menu 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.730
 Depending on the technology we are currently working on 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.860
 Various rules for our own 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.850
 I think it would be nice if you could make it 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.040
 Only long serve type of serve 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.490
 Try it or try to make the course one side after that 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.980
 Try to play a game with only two thirds 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.650
 After that try to play the game only in the rally game 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.700
 No matter what rules you do 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.480
 I do not mind that we 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.530
 Focusing on the technology that is the subject 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.540
 I think it would be better to make it according to our own issues 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.300
 Thank you for trying it out
