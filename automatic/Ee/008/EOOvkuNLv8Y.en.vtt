00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello I am today with ophelia 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000
 Strawberry pie is blogger 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.860
 also manicure will be able to emails 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.259
 ophelia to answer the question 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.240
 how to make a water marc beuls but 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.880
 water marc beuls is a technique that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.310
 is to put polish in a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 little pot of water and you'll see we're going 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 make drawings on this surface of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.849
 the water and I'm going 30 and my fingernail and we 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.119
 let's have this result a result 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.740
 ouattara want it's an original motive 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.960
 with some marble motifs and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.180
 we will start by laying a foundation 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 white so that the re the colors 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.360
 stand out a lot more I leave 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.260
 dry the first layer then i'm going 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.260
 to spend a second 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.629
 I'm waiting for the second layer to be 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.670
 dry and then I'll put some scotch tape 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.739
 protect the pos so as not to mess 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.539
 his fingers so I'm going to ask a piece 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 of Scotch that I'm going to put under 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.199
 the angle that will serve to protect the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 under the nail as well as 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.710
 cuticles on the side then another small 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.860
 piece that I'm going to put on top of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.020
 the nail to protect the culture for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 this technique you have to go very fast 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.110
 for that I open all 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.650
 first the varnishes I'm going to use 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.390
 so as not to waste time so here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.430
 I chose too three colors we can 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.460
 course choose - as can we 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 choose more so I'm going to start 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.579
 close first circle 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 so you need a fairly liquid varnish 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.790
 so I start by putting my first 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 varnish road a second and I'm going 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.220
 continue so on with the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.220
 colors that I chose 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.860
 I can possibly move my baby 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.290
 pot of water to spread the circles 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.880
 when your circles do not spread out 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.150
 so just stop it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.430
 it's useless to continue so there you 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.500
 see I'm going to stop and I'm going to do 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.899
 the drawings on the surface of the water to 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.340
 using a small wooden stick so 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.330
 I do drawings randomly 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.190
 draw what you want in the water a 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 once I got a nice pattern 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 so I'm dipping my angle in the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.830
 pot so I quench my nail 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.630
 parallel to the surface of the water and 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.670
 with a small stick I will remove 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:41.740
 all that remains on the surface 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:44.680
 of water then I come out my nail and 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.350
 so we have the pattern then quickly we 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.800
 will remove the tape that served us at 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.870
 protect the skin as long as it's not 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.730
 is that with the help of a stick I'm going 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.110
 come scratch the cuticles and you 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.540
 go see that varnish by very 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.970
 easily then using 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.100
 solvent and a square brush like 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.239
 this I'm going to clean my cuticles so 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.239
 to have a perfect result 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.930
 so I quench my brush and I'm going 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.750
 simply clean what has 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.400
 overwhelmed I will then add some 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.810
 keys of the nr not been to give 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.810
 more relief in nail art 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.520
 and to finish the manicure I'm going 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.080
 add a layer of top coat 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.730
 transparent to make shine and make 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.500
 hold your nail art since we 're going 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.360
 clean the cuticles with 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.670
 dissolving that we dry out the skin 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.580
 I hydrate my skin with him 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.640
 cuticle to have a result again 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.640
 better 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.280
 now it's up to you to do your 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.260

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.440
 very easy so now it's up to you 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.440
