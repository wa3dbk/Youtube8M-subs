00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.940
 my Italian cuisine today we're going to do 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.029
 a risotto with asparagus in a manner 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.359
 really delicious and above all not 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.730
 we are going to use the butter but what is it to me 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.160
 tracts of c surely i want to do 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.850
 a good risotto as it goes then to do it 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.710
 stir to make it come good good 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 creamy today devoid of revealing something 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.879
 but besides not using Turkish 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.450
 great but nothing using wine 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.760
 White 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 in short, we are going to do strange things 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.539
 had use a little bit of wine 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.739
 red well now I'll show you which ones 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.780
 are the ingredients that we will go to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.510
 use to make this ours 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.230
 recipe and but let's start with the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.600
 our preparation for ours 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.520
 special risotto we need 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.010
 our asparagus look how wonderful 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 which are in short rich in iron and are 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.570
 full of many good things we do 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.670
 understood well then the rice of the parmesan and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.280
 of pecorino having made fifty e 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.350
 fifty parsley of the vegetable broth 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.400
 red onion then a bar 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 Tropea spring onion 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.950
 but if you don't have red onion , it's fine 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 in short, it has me a little golden 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.890
 extra virgin olive oil from the pese 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.610
 of salt and the red wine we have 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.469
 say 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.250
 take a red stamp because it is 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:44.189
 important because this red wine from 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.289
 an important part of the body of the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.200
 our product therefore not less a 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.179
 low quality red wine 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.390
 Now let's start cutting the 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.799
 onion we cut the asparagus tips 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.799
 let's start right away despite the attraction 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.500
 of our asparagus and I started a 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.020
 cut that as they are beautiful 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.630
 fresh as they are paul country salad 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.510
 arrive in this way the part e 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.329
 nature of the stem change we have it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.130
 already deleted anyway to see this 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.459
 for example we are present part nights 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.290
 hard to go and see how the pasta 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.660
 remade so it does when it breaks into 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.690
 this way our tip of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.230
 asparagus this part which all that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.690
 tender 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.319
 simply in this way now 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.430
 come to prepare all of them ok but 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.440
 we begin to put a little oil 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.440
 enter the pot we add his 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:51.580
 crazy let's brown a little bit 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:53.379
 perfect so now that the onion 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:03.380
 begins to feel we go to 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:05.210
 add perfect physique 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.960
 price make him very little stay 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:14.920
 and then we go to add the asparagus 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.920
 OK perfect 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.000
 now you have mixed well with yourself 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.930
 let's add the red wine and it 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.930
 let's fade 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.829
 perfect at this point we go to 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.219
 add a tablespoon of broth a 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:46.150
 maestro I find myself at a time and wait 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:48.959
 that the rice lake begins to form 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.219
 its cream and we cook it 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.980
 adding a meter from the door 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:57.040
 let's always take it from ha 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.040
 grafted our face so that we don't 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.540
 goes to attack but above all yes 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.099
 they can eliminate whites because 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.239
 remember remote questions that will be the 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:11.849
 butter so I needed help 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.849
 so that the 20 star crack ok 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.870
 excellent we reach a little at a time 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.320
 until the product is gone 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.440
 over 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.570
 and our risotto will be photos and also 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.669
 asparagus must be won 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.669
 and always remember something is 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:40.060
 important make sure it is warm on 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:43.389
 your blog the rice is ready now 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.970
 we turn off the heat and add a 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.250
 little bit of parsley then we fix it 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.250
 of sade and we start to put some 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.220
 parmesan and let's try to make the 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.620
 creaming without as you can see in 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.990
 in any case the cream was able to form 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.990
 the why this is the mida of the rice that 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:11.940
 we managed to come up with a thesis 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:11.940
 that of salt and affection 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.500
 ok 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.039
 here is the magic 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.860
 look at how wonderful it has become 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:37.969
 creamy a nice risotto the wave without 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.719
 butter 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:45.490
 Now let's leave to serve 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:48.430
 finish of father looks that nice that 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.919
 just beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.249
 and then it is very fragrant that it comes 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.279
 I used I used on air 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:03.139
 bitter as wine my a very wine 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:04.869
 good and then protected then when 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.729
 you want to do this kind of preparation 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:10.129
 use a wine that is high 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.740
 quality to close the dish and I have to 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:15.949
 allow a sprinkling of pepper 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.080
 chapel just above this yes if you 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.300
 like it if you don't like it hot 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.599
 if you don't like it so that you can 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.149
 put in the pot for later 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:29.020
 go cup paper mix so that 

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:32.180
 you find it but I find it to be a lot 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.370
 good to smell even in the 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.909
 so left only a little bit of 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.229
 fresh and important parsley that there 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.839
 let it be a little bit of fresh parsley 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.759
 above because I can guarantee you who 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:47.569
 leaves a flavor scent that it really is 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:52.490
 exceptional as I put it, and 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:56.340
 then we go to close with a trickle of 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:07:00.620
 extra virgin olive oil 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:04.470
 where is my bell that miss elected 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.360

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:12.350
 of the corratec tasting wonderfully 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.350
 we tried is a bit hot in short 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:23.580
 I challenge you to try to make it clear that 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:30.630
 he doesn't like it's delicious first thing ve 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:32.970
 you have to adjust well with salt I like 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.639
 a love is so delicious 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:40.050
 the asparagus is important if it is nice and fresh 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:42.180
 beautiful cockades cooking so however it remains 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.490
 a little bit with the camper and this is the thing 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.780
 good because it's cooked you are in your mouth 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:50.210
 in the port 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:52.590
 but those who release it open completely 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:57.780
 release all its flavors not because 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:08:00.300
 in you eat it well then it will do powers 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.940
