there<00:02:29.880> we<00:02:29.940> go<00:02:30.090> strength<00:02:30.770> when<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> diamond

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
there we go strength when the diamond

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.430 
there we go strength when the diamond
boom<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.160> have<00:02:35.640> strength<00:02:35.990> now<00:02:36.990> like<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.410> said

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
boom I have strength now like I said

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.930 
boom I have strength now like I said
there<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> fourth<00:02:38.190> level<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> pyramid

there is a fourth level to the pyramid

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.240 
there is a fourth level to the pyramid
but<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.300> stupidly<00:02:39.870> forgot<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.800> add<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:40.950> in

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
but I stupidly forgot to add that in

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.390 
but I stupidly forgot to add that in
although<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.970> pretty<00:02:42.150> simple<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.480> add<00:02:42.570> in

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
although that is pretty simple to add in

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
although that is pretty simple to add in
the<00:02:44.400> redstone<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.060> underneath<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.200> you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the redstone is underneath and if you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.199 
the redstone is underneath and if you
give<00:02:46.380> me<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> second<00:02:46.830> i'll<00:02:46.920> show<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.430> sliced

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
give me a second i'll show you a sliced

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.160 
give me a second i'll show you a sliced
demonstration<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.989> i'm<00:02:49.650> back<00:02:49.970> ok<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.330> here<00:02:51.959> is

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
demonstration and i'm back ok so here is

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.680 
demonstration and i'm back ok so here is
the<00:02:52.560> contraption<00:02:53.310> all<00:02:53.489> neatly<00:02:53.790> sliced<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.480> so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
the contraption all neatly sliced up so

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.850 
the contraption all neatly sliced up so
that<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.050> see<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.350> redstone<00:02:55.709> lying

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that you can see the redstone lying

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.620 
that you can see the redstone lying
underneath<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.030> little<00:02:57.239> bit<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.480> back

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
underneath is a little bit on the back

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.020 
underneath is a little bit on the back
too<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.110> won't<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.160> into<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.489> depth<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.940> how

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
too I won't go into in depth and how

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.729 
too I won't go into in depth and how
this<00:03:00.209> works<00:03:00.540> but<00:03:00.840> i<00:03:00.900> will<00:03:01.140> show<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.410> how<00:03:01.500> it

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
this works but i will show you how it

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.900 
this works but i will show you how it
looks<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.070> from<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.280> outside<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.880> should

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
looks like from the outside you should

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
looks like from the outside you should
be<00:03:03.120> able<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.450> figure<00:03:03.570> out<00:03:03.690> how<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> works<00:03:04.050> from

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
be able to figure out how it works from

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.260 
be able to figure out how it works from
there<00:03:04.520> basically<00:03:05.520> when<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.790> push<00:03:06.120> this

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
there basically when you push this

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.240 
there basically when you push this
button<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:07.350> pillar<00:03:07.590> sand<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.040> middle

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
button that pillar sand in the middle

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.240 
button that pillar sand in the middle
drops<00:03:08.550> blown<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.239> Deaf's<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:10.590> selects<00:03:10.890> one

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
drops blown to the Deaf's it selects one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.729 
drops blown to the Deaf's it selects one
of<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.940> Emerald<00:03:12.450> blocks<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:13.260> I've<00:03:13.410> stored

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
of the Emerald blocks that I've stored

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.530 
of the Emerald blocks that I've stored
in<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.010> little<00:03:14.220> pocket<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:14.580> pushes<00:03:15.420> them
