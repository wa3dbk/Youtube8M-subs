00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.270
 and richard ford canada because I 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.699
 it seems one of your best books and 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.350
 the story of the stars or not a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.420
 Teen 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.970
 of how to change your life because your 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.550
 parents commit a robbery that I do not expect 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.190
 nothing because it's the first line of the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.400
 book and with this powerful start 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.580
 then let's say that everything revolves around 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.670
 around that fact and what better in another 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.410
 author could have been something heavy or 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 that would have become boring 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 richard so narrates it superbly 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.220
 also book that I liked the most 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.230
 year without any doubt it has been Canada the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.579
 last right novel published by 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.579
 anagram 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.700
 it seems to me a novel of maturity 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.500
 absolutely essential is the 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.860
 history of awakening to the life of a 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.540
 adolescent that already family is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.250
 absolutely destroyed by something of 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.990
 new and with a fact there are several facts 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.420
 that I'm not going to tell and that you have to 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.759
 move from the deep east 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.190
 North American to Canada with a family 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.920
 impostada is a novel full of 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.600
 aphorisms that talk about life about 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.280
 the love about death over sex 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.610
 about the things that concern us in 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.270
 reality the truth 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:37.400
 a true master, I'm not going to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.890
 recommend the Swiss writer's book 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.020
 alex campus called the lion a 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.509
 louis 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.799
 and I recommend this book fundamentally 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.619
 because it 's a very love story 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:54.759
 atypical and located in a background 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:56.300
 very good historical for me 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.670
 the book of the year 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.160
 heretics of leonardo padura why then 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.950
 because I think he 's a writer still 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.590
 here to discover I think they have the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.770
 very strong magnificent characters 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.500
 Mario Conde - is an excellent character and 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.950
 then because it has been a total novel 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.560
 a novel that police court of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:26.400
 historical court and social court 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:28.739
 heretics I as a bookseller recommend a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.230
 new translation but absolutely 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.790
 new of the complete poems of emily 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.920
 Dickinson that he has made a 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.010
 specialist in German literature that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 is jose Luis king and also poet is a 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.900
 bilingual edition 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.060
 the translation is absolutely new and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.440
 almost almost unbeatable the final of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.890
 one of those that I consider the book of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.180
 year is the sublime life that is the life of 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.730
 fox good comic I think a writer 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.660
 good to rescue seems to me also very 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.830
 relevant to the time we lived was 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:12.780
 a great inspiration since Gandhi and 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.180
 his and his peaceful resistance up 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.060
 Martin Luther King and good the time that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.000
 we live also I think it's very relevant 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 and more in this case because it 's your life in 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.120
 comic format and that makes it so 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.890
 approach a lot of people that maybe not 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.630
 know how to do it and I think all the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.610
 world should read the books the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.410
 revolt of the cockroach village 2 jail 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.170
 tacos is edited by watercolor 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.370
 because I think a royalty is a great 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.800
 jail opportunity is coast is a 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.160
 character associated with the history of 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.040
 hunter that thompson but very unknown 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.090
 and is someone who almost accidentally 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.010
 became the leader of a movement 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.010
 of the Chicano movement in the USA 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.300
 I have chosen as one of the books that 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.100
 I liked this year more than eloy 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.230
 blight that is called techniques of 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.130
 lighting and just posted 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.370
 pages of foam is a book that has 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.550
 very much liked are stories are 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.710
 stories that have to do with what 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.480
 small of the everyday reminded me 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.070
 much to the readings that I have done this 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.530
 alice munro's year for example of their 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.130
 alice munro stories and it's like a 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.120
 focus on the little things I think 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.240
 that one of the most important books 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.120
 of the year is in the house of leaves that is 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.510
 a novel that has edited alpha decay and 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.060
 pale fire and that in the USA has been a 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.090
 editorial phenomenon endorsed by the 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:55.960
 very steve king because in fact it is 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:00.010
 a horror thriller tells the story 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.320
 the arrival of a journalist with his 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:07.340
 journalist with his wife to a rural house 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.220
 of virginia a marriage in crisis and 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.680
 when they arrive at the house they realize 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.680
 an architectural peculiarity
