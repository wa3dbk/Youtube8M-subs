00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
they were established so let's think of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.720 
they were established so let's think of
an<00:00:53.100> example

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
an example

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.279

and now obviously the 83 in this game
and<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.979> bit

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and it just it just it was a little bit

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.690 
and it just it just it was a little bit
too<00:01:41.340> confusing<00:01:42.090> yeah<00:01:42.649> 83<00:01:43.649> why<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> game<00:01:44.549> was

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
too confusing yeah 83 why the game was

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.789 
too confusing yeah 83 why the game was
gonna<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.880> set<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.270> 1983<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.439> game<00:01:46.590> exactly

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
gonna be set in 1983 so the game exactly

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.700 
gonna be set in 1983 so the game exactly
is<00:01:47.220> set<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.880> 1987<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:48.960> far<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.500> gather

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
is set in 1987 as far as we can gather

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.480 
is set in 1987 as far as we can gather

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
it's the first child I mean we're trying

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.080 
it's the first child I mean we're trying
to<00:04:09.920> establish<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.310> timeline<00:04:10.400> here<00:04:10.940> so

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
to establish a timeline here so

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.300 
to establish a timeline here so
potentially<00:04:11.570> exhausting<00:04:12.140> still<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:13.070> first

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
potentially exhausting still the first

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.920 
potentially exhausting still the first
child<00:04:13.660> might've<00:04:14.660> 87<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.470> then

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
child might've 87 and then

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.469

murders afterwards yeah still trying to

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.599 
murders afterwards yeah still trying to
slowly<00:04:18.810> piece<00:04:19.139> it<00:04:19.259> together<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.829> 1983

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609

Easter<00:04:20.970> Egg<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.359> think<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.910> just<00:04:24.210> makes<00:04:24.479> sense

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
Easter Egg I think it just makes sense

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.860 
Easter Egg I think it just makes sense
for<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:26.070> be<00:04:26.449> fredbear<00:04:27.449> friends

it<00:04:44.220> just<00:04:44.430> wouldn't<00:04:44.699> make<00:04:44.940> sense<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.449> let's<00:04:45.600> go

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
it just wouldn't make sense and let's go

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.990 
it just wouldn't make sense and let's go
ball<00:04:47.370> which<00:04:48.000> which<00:04:48.599> he<00:04:48.690> has<00:04:48.780> been<00:04:48.930> known<00:04:49.139> to<00:04:49.169> do
