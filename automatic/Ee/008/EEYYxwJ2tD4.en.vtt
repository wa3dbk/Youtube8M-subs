00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.400
 the awareness that we need 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.429
 reduce the amount of waste you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.099
 we produce and, if possible, reuse 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.949
 somehow put the head of 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.529
 a lot of people to function and the result 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.259
 which we had was an increasing number 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.999
 of creations that decorate adorn 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.999
 organize and enchant 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.149
 one of these items that make continuous 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.909
 very successful in decoration are 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.339
 boxes and spools of wood 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.879
 used in the power plants and 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.879
 fairs 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.950
 the law can be found from several 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.700
 iron steel classic materials 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.649
 the most common are wooden pallets 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.960
 use is necessary and essential in 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.979
 stocking of brazilian products 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.990
 The most common relatives are the ppr 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.840
 made of the harder one way 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.200
 hardwood can be used pine 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.200
 or eucalyptus 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.860
 there are also disposable pallets are 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.690
 thinner parts and if your 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.600
 use in the transport of the goods 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.660
 until the supplier remains in the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:08.020
 store or embarkation and disembarkation of 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:10.720
 with which they have come for some time 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.150
 long time ago the use of these materials 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.030
 were well seen by some 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.360
 definitely they are taking care of 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.450
 the homes of the most stylish and bold 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.450
 1 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.500
 Before I rolled a model I cut them 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.010
 I used some spares 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.840
 also for full fixation and now go 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.350
 receive a coat of varnish only for 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.150
 treat wood and protect but who 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.269
 You want to let go of your imagination a little more 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.100
 and close a little more put colors 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.830
 working a stew is also very 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.860
 nice, this particular service will go 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.650
 receive colored upholstery that will be 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.650
 placed later but the wood will stay 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.950
 with natural appearance other elements that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.500
 I used in this space are stones that are 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.080
 manufactured from the reuse of 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.880
 wastes from the 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.930
 was discarded just as the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.390
 pallets 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.180
 now they use and produce materials 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.180
 beautiful to use gardening 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.960
 this model of bank here I used a 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.040
 pallet and mail 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.770
 we have at the time see 2 pallets for 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.140
 the seat and a half for the backrest 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.420
 the cool of the pallet that he is a wood 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.670
 that has worked is already very dry 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.920
 There's going to be a penalty problem like this. 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.770
 basic care is sanding and spending 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.200
 product to protect or varnish or a 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.330
 ink a sealer some product that 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.970
 protect wood but there is no great 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.100
 be careful because the idea of 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.880
 use is that it becomes a material 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.100
 more rustic of iac I cashed a model 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.130
 that she is not ready yet 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.920
 in these vain she has among the 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.549
 that is typical of the pallet only 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.520
 I retired through the top here go stones 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.470
 that is the white side and below it goes 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.050
 have lighting to highlight these 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.480
 stones after up goes a little from 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.430
 Glass for us has a more finished 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.960
 to be able to put another element 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.169
 decoration 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.750
 this other bank model I used 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.610
 him without back because he will stay in the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.500
 environmentally friendly 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.590
 so how do I not want to block the vision? 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.020
 who's sitting here on the terrace there? 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.520
 out to see the landscape I chose a 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.620
 model without cost 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.930
 here was used a sawing priest 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.380
 to the half employed the two parties one 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.380
 on top of the other 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.620
 and looks at itself as an element that is 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.420
 very high 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.150
 I always recommend that in a good project 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.550
 the essential is the hiring of 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.320
 professionals in all areas 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.680
 the engineer architect each in his 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.990
 specialty, but it is essential for the 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.970
 the client's face that he or she 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.610
 press somehow your 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.370
 personality and that is one more thing 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.910
 cool than a mobile yourself 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.250
 produced put your personal taste I am 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.780
 your imagination to a way of 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.630
 to express life today is so 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.370
 run make a move at the end of 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.370
 week with your load
