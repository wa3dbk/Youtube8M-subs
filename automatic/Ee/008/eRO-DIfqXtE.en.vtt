do in and be to be a good Center you

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.750 
do in and be to be a good Center you

need to rebound play defense and make

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.050 
need to rebound play defense and make
layups<00:04:39.030> rather<00:04:40.020> spring<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.650> you'd<00:04:41.550> be<00:04:41.700> a<00:04:41.729> max

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
layups rather spring and you'd be a max

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.340 
layups rather spring and you'd be a max
player<00:04:43.160> but<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.610> think<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:45.960> he<00:04:46.050> got<00:04:46.169> all

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
player but I think you know he got all

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.779 
player but I think you know he got all
the<00:04:46.500> tools<00:04:46.680> so<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:48.240> be<00:04:48.780> very<00:04:49.020> successful<00:04:49.289> as<00:04:50.100> a

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
the tools so to be very successful as a

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.300 
the tools so to be very successful as a
lot<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.150> pressure<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.570> him<00:04:51.950> know<00:04:52.950> people<00:04:53.220> can

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
lot of pressure to him know people can

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.510 
lot of pressure to him know people can
appear<00:04:53.580> him<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:53.940> Sabonis<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:55.650> don't<00:04:56.310> think

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
appear him to Sabonis and I don't think

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.490 
appear him to Sabonis and I don't think
it's<00:04:56.700> fair<00:04:57.210> comparison<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:58.080> know<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
it's fair comparison you know the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.100 
it's fair comparison you know the
bonuses<00:04:59.010> said<00:04:59.450> probably<00:05:00.450> one<00:05:00.690> of<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.870> best

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
bonuses said probably one of the best

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.520

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.800 
ever to play and he was unbelievable
talent<00:05:05.010> but<00:05:05.700> I<00:05:05.789> think<00:05:06.030> he<00:05:06.180> he<00:05:06.479> can<00:05:06.600> be<00:05:06.660> very

talent but I think he he can be very

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.220 
talent but I think he he can be very
good<00:05:07.200> if<00:05:07.530> he<00:05:07.910> stays<00:05:08.910> focused

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230
