 stone was replaced by jacky at the beginning 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.940
 of season 2 is not because he

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.690
 large scale especially at the level 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.100

 who is pitching perfectly represents the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.120
 Japanese stereotype but after having 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.990
 considering that the public did not care royally 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.580

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.050
