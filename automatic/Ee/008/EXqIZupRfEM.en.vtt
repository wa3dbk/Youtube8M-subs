00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939
 it's the most exciting race in the world 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.480
 this kind with the airline 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.020
 it's south america 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.020
 I do 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.929
 the fifth stage of this dakar 2010 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.890
 and maybe the one that already has 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.749
 change everything 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.909
 in the category motorcycles anyway she may have crowned the future 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.179
 winner 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.320
 a broken ebro leg that's how the hopes of two of the favorites 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.530
 were buried 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.559
 you can hate first of all had to leave the rally after a heavy 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.620
 fall 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.920
 big pain the tight heart the sherco pilot left the test in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.160
 helicopter 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
 it's his first sales report in seven participations 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 by thomas he is still there but he seems doomed to fight for a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.190
 place of honor 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.410
 by damaging his rear wheel the spanish lost a lot of time 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.430
 still about 40 minutes m offering him his wheel the italian luca manca him 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.670
 saved the day 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.610
 but he still points minors 16 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.140
 he is ready 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.880
 the French who spent a quiet day without taking any 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.830
 risks in the winner's wheel of the day 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.530
 for the first special 100% Chilean francisco the meal is served 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.150
 on this earth 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600
 like last year he waited for his arrival 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.220
 to illustrate 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.450
 he signs his second victory on the rally performs a superb operation 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 in general since he wins 5 places 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.530
 and ends up 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.530
 37 minutes from Cyril des Prés 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.960
 we also note the day was rather violent volkswagen had 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.360
 decided to do the analysts 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.430
 Mission totally filled with a successful tripling on the stage and especially 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.400
 now the first three places overall be made by the blues 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.710
 although dakar winners in his career is leading since monday as 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.160
 everyone stéphane péterhansel can be betrayed by his machine 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.490
 km 135 of the special its transmission axis those who 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.160
 it is necessary to stop prepared he will leave 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.480
 unfortunately he has to stop again a few kilometers later 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.509
 in the busy he lost more than two hours 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.509
 and all his dreams the final victory 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.339
 the victory of volkswagen should be disputed between them today what 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.509
 are the honors was for mark millar but the good deal is for 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:25.239
 caen scene that he first struck finally signed a success on the dakar he had 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.789
 turned around for a long time with in particular the year 2009 where he had 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.309
 collected the places of honor 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:33.179
 and it's paradoxically on a ground where the former president who won 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.179
 he expects from him and his teammates stage if al-attiyah 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.099
 this is probably the p45 for the head of the general he 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.159
 counts four minutes 37 of advanced on al-attiyah and 9 39 on minors 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.149
 competition 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.209
 very far 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.069
 robby gordon 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.799
