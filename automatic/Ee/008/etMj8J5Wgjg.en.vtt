ground<00:00:16.560> stretching<00:00:17.130> your<00:00:17.250> quads<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.730> very

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
ground stretching your quads is very

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.050 
ground stretching your quads is very
very<00:00:18.240> effective<00:00:18.710> but<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.130> improving

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
very effective but it is not improving

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.300 
very effective but it is not improving
your<00:00:21.210> ability<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.779> stay<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.500> posture<00:00:23.039> when<00:00:23.189> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
your ability to stay in posture when you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.519 
your ability to stay in posture when you
run<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.939> balanced<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.600> also<00:00:25.109> hold<00:00:25.380> your

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
run and be balanced and also hold your

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859 
run and be balanced and also hold your
pelvis<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.130> alignment<00:00:26.640> now<00:00:27.300> stretching<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
pelvis in alignment now stretching the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.750 
pelvis in alignment now stretching the
quads<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.289> kind<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.590> complicated<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
quads is kind of complicated because the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.150 
quads is kind of complicated because the
knee<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.300> an<00:00:30.840> unstable<00:00:31.230> place<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> knee<00:00:31.980> can

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
knee is an unstable place the knee can

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.430 
knee is an unstable place the knee can
flex<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.579> extend<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.540> hip<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.110> only

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
flex and extend and the hip can not only

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.870 
flex and extend and the hip can not only
move<00:00:34.649> forward<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.100> backwards<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.670> can

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
move forward and backwards but it can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.490 
move forward and backwards but it can
move<00:00:36.030> inwards<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.600> outwards<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
move inwards and outwards and up and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.440 
move inwards and outwards and up and
down<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:37.829> well<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.149> quite<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
down as well so you have to do quite a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.319 
down as well so you have to do quite a
lot<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.780> work<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.410> actively<00:00:41.040> release<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
lot of work to actively release the the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.240 
lot of work to actively release the the
quad<00:00:43.079> muscle<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> quad<00:00:43.829> muscle<00:00:44.129> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
quad muscle and the quad muscle that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
quad muscle and the quad muscle that
we're<00:00:44.399> basically<00:00:44.789> focusing<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.480> again<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
we're basically focusing on again is the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
we're basically focusing on again is the
rectus<00:00:46.379> femoris<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> beginning<00:00:48.030> when

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
rectus femoris now in the beginning when

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760 
rectus femoris now in the beginning when
you<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.480> exercise<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.350> use<00:00:49.530> some

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you do this exercise you can use some

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.520 
you do this exercise you can use some
support<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.820> ideally<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> improve<00:00:52.440> your

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
support but ideally just to improve your

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439 
support but ideally just to improve your
proprioception<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> opposite<00:00:53.910> ankle<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
proprioception in the opposite ankle and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
proprioception in the opposite ankle and
also<00:00:54.960> improve<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.350> balance<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.129> dynamic

going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> make<00:01:38.100> sure<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> these<00:01:38.640> thighs<00:01:38.970> are

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
going to make sure that these thighs are

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
going to make sure that these thighs are
parallel<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:40.590> from<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> front<00:01:41.159> section

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
parallel and then from the front section

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.249 
parallel and then from the front section
notice<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.329> doing<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.689> badly<00:01:42.960> I'm

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
notice if I'm doing this badly I'm

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.840 
notice if I'm doing this badly I'm
pushing<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> hip<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> side<00:01:44.399> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
pushing this hip out to the side I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
pushing this hip out to the side I
really<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> pick<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.720> hip<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
really want to pick that hip up so that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
really want to pick that hip up so that
my<00:01:47.280> pelvis<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.970> parallel<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> front

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
my pelvis is parallel from the front

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.359 
my pelvis is parallel from the front
that's<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:49.950> doing<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that's what I want to be doing in that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
that's what I want to be doing in that
parallel<00:01:50.640> position<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.320> nice

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
parallel position all right so I'm nice

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
parallel position all right so I'm nice
and<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> front<00:01:53.340> my<00:01:53.880> hip<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.210> tucked

on this on this left side my thighs are

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.319 
on this on this left side my thighs are
parallel<00:01:57.320> alright<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.640> do<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
parallel alright now I do the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
parallel alright now I do the
million-dollar<00:02:00.810> move<00:02:01.079> alright<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.299> which<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
million-dollar move alright and which is

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149 
million-dollar move alright and which is
to<00:02:03.689> pinch<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:04.110> glute<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.530> before<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
to pinch my glute but before that what I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.100 
to pinch my glute but before that what I
actually<00:02:05.340> want<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.360> push<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.840> foot

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
actually want to do is just push my foot

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680 
actually want to do is just push my foot
slightly<00:02:07.649> into<00:02:08.190> my<00:02:08.310> hand<00:02:08.610> pull<00:02:09.300> my<00:02:09.450> knees

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
slightly into my hand pull my knees

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.320 
slightly into my hand pull my knees
slightly<00:02:10.080> forward<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.250> way<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.150> I'm

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
slightly forward in this way so that I'm

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.390 
slightly forward in this way so that I'm
loading<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:12.930> here

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
loading up that here

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.130 
loading up that here
and<00:02:13.489> then<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.239> million-dollar<00:02:14.720> move<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and then the million-dollar move I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.199 
and then the million-dollar move I
pinched<00:02:15.560> my<00:02:15.769> glute<00:02:16.069> as<00:02:16.370> hard<00:02:16.580> as<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.819> which

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
pinched my glute as hard as I can which

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.270 
pinched my glute as hard as I can which
is<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.510> bat<00:02:17.750> muscle<00:02:18.170> here<00:02:18.379> pitch<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.980> as<00:02:19.069> hard

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
is this bat muscle here pitch it as hard

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.309 
is this bat muscle here pitch it as hard
as<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.459> possibly<00:02:19.489> can<00:02:20.120> keep<00:02:20.390> my<00:02:20.540> head<00:02:20.750> up<00:02:20.900> keep

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
as I possibly can keep my head up keep

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.820 
as I possibly can keep my head up keep
my<00:02:21.500> body<00:02:21.709> down<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.190> now<00:02:22.670> draw<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.209> leg<00:02:23.510> back

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
my body down and now draw the leg back

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.770 
my body down and now draw the leg back
over<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> seven<00:02:25.250> count<00:02:25.489> period<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.239> then

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
over a seven count period and then

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.170 
over a seven count period and then
slowly<00:02:27.200> lower<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.650> down<00:02:27.950> again<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:28.730> draw<00:02:29.030> it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
slowly lower that down again and draw it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.780 
slowly lower that down again and draw it
back<00:02:29.209> again<00:02:29.890> all<00:02:30.890> right<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.430> hold<00:02:31.670> it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
back again all right and just hold it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.600 
back again all right and just hold it
briefly<00:02:32.329> and<00:02:32.720> come<00:02:33.260> back<00:02:33.440> down<00:02:33.680> again<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
briefly and come back down again and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.490 
briefly and come back down again and
that's<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.060> most<00:02:35.239> effective<00:02:35.810> way<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.019> stretch

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
that's the most effective way to stretch

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.170 
that's the most effective way to stretch
this<00:02:36.709> upper<00:02:37.040> quad<00:02:37.250> muscle<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.790> so

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
this upper quad muscle that is so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.080 
this upper quad muscle that is so
essential<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:39.019> running<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:39.980> keep<00:02:40.579> those<00:02:40.730> quads

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
essential in running so keep those quads

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.430 
essential in running so keep those quads
loose<00:02:41.390> because<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.019> quads<00:02:42.260> are<00:02:42.409> tight

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
loose because if the quads are tight

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.470 
loose because if the quads are tight
they<00:02:43.250> pull<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> front<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:43.970> pelvis<00:02:44.120> down

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
they pull the front of the pelvis down

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.610 
they pull the front of the pelvis down
and<00:02:44.690> they<00:02:44.750> put<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.019> hamstrings<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and they put the hamstrings on the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.020 
and they put the hamstrings on the
pressure<00:02:45.859> you<00:02:46.129> really<00:02:46.370> want<00:02:46.549> those<00:02:46.700> quads

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
pressure you really want those quads

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.030 
pressure you really want those quads
nice<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.540> loose<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.590> pelvis<00:02:48.799> can

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
nice and loose so that the pelvis can

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.949 
nice and loose so that the pelvis can
remain<00:02:49.310> neutral<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.329> pressure<00:02:50.540> can<00:02:50.780> come

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
remain neutral and the pressure can come

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.780 
remain neutral and the pressure can come
off<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.170> hamstrings<00:02:51.620> good<00:02:52.430> luck<00:02:52.579> out<00:02:52.730> there

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
off the hamstrings good luck out there

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.780 
off the hamstrings good luck out there
speak<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:53.390> next<00:02:53.569> time
