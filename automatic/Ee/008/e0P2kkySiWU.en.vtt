in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.570> clip<00:00:00.840> we're<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.260> talk<00:00:01.469> about

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
in this clip we're going to talk about

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.679 
in this clip we're going to talk about
how<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> structure<00:00:02.399> your<00:00:02.550> play<00:00:02.970> now<00:00:03.449> there's<00:00:03.629> a

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
how to structure your play now there's a

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.420 
how to structure your play now there's a
very<00:00:03.870> basic<00:00:03.990> chart<00:00:04.560> but<00:00:04.770> what<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:04.980> can<00:00:05.160> do<00:00:05.279> is

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
very basic chart but what we can do is

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.369 
very basic chart but what we can do is
add<00:00:05.609> on<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.210> make<00:00:06.390> some<00:00:06.420> changes<00:00:07.080> and

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
add on to that and make some changes and

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.410 
add on to that and make some changes and
make<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.160> little<00:00:08.280> more<00:00:08.400> workable<00:00:08.849> so

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
make it a little more workable so

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.150 
make it a little more workable so
basically<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> beginning<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.860> have<00:00:10.889> your

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
basically at the beginning you have your

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.299 
basically at the beginning you have your
exposition<00:00:11.610> which<00:00:12.599> tells<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.290> background<00:00:13.860> of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
exposition which tells the background of

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.490 
exposition which tells the background of
all<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.940> characters<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> story<00:00:16.199> just

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
all the characters and the story just

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.740 
all the characters and the story just
enough<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> audience<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.880> understand

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
enough for the audience to understand

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.720 
enough for the audience to understand
what's<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.350> before<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.130> conflicts

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
what's going on before the conflicts

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.700 
what's going on before the conflicts
really<00:00:20.970> start<00:00:21.210> happening<00:00:21.660> then<00:00:22.289> you've<00:00:22.500> got

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
really start happening then you've got

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.250 
really start happening then you've got
your<00:00:22.890> rising<00:00:23.160> action<00:00:23.880> as<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.330> story<00:00:24.689> develops

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
your rising action as the story develops

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.099 
your rising action as the story develops
as<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> conflicts<00:00:26.310> hit<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.390> builds<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
as the conflicts hit and that builds and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.599 
as the conflicts hit and that builds and
builds<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.529> builds<00:00:28.590> until<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.130> get<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
builds and builds until you get to the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.920 
builds and builds until you get to the
climax<00:00:30.150> then<00:00:31.140> after<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> climax<00:00:32.520> comes<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
climax then after the climax comes the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.130 
climax then after the climax comes the
falling<00:00:34.410> action<00:00:34.620> which<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.270> wrap<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.719> from

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
falling action which is the wrap up from

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040 
falling action which is the wrap up from
the<00:00:37.440> climax<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.629> happened

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the climax and all that has happened

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
the climax and all that has happened
there<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.550> end<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
there and then at the very end of that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.340 
there and then at the very end of that
is<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> dino<00:00:43.230> ma<00:00:43.440> which<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.350> unraveling

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
is the dino ma which is the unraveling

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.080 
is the dino ma which is the unraveling
and<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.010> structure<00:00:47.489> goes<00:00:47.670> something<00:00:48.059> like

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and the structure goes something like

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.639 
and the structure goes something like
this

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
this

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.700 
this
officially<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> structure<00:00:50.100> goes<00:00:50.280> exposition

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
officially the structure goes exposition

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
officially the structure goes exposition
rising<00:00:52.710> action<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.820> climax<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.809> then

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
rising action then the climax and then

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
rising action then the climax and then
the<00:00:55.140> falling<00:00:55.620> action<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> day<00:00:56.879> no

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the falling action and then the day no

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.260 
the falling action and then the day no
ma<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> important<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.120> if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
ma now what I think is important is if

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
ma now what I think is important is if
you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.750> instead<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> starting<00:01:01.920> off<00:01:02.100> here

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you can instead of starting off here

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.479 
you can instead of starting off here
going<00:01:03.080> exposition<00:01:04.080> exposition<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
going exposition exposition on this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
going exposition exposition on this
straight<00:01:05.729> line<00:01:05.840> start<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.990> off<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.439> quickly

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
straight line start it off as quickly

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.429 
straight line start it off as quickly
and<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.640> things<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and into things as you can and do the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.789 
and into things as you can and do the
exposition<00:01:11.130> along<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.439> can

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
exposition along the way that if you can

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.950 
exposition along the way that if you can
might<00:01:14.729> work<00:01:15.000> better<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.509> sort<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
might work better it's sort of like a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
might work better it's sort of like a
movie<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> first<00:01:16.890> 30<00:01:17.820> seconds<00:01:18.299> sometimes

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
movie in the first 30 seconds sometimes

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
movie in the first 30 seconds sometimes
that<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.110> grabs<00:01:19.380> us<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> there's<00:01:19.950> no

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that really grabs us and there's no

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
that really grabs us and there's no
reason<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> play<00:01:20.790> should<00:01:21.600> start<00:01:21.900> off<00:01:22.110> slow<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
reason to play should start off slow and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.890 
reason to play should start off slow and
talking<00:01:23.220> until<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.759> into<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
talking until we get into it so if you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
talking until we get into it so if you
can<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.710> play<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.310> make<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
can do that with your play and make it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.330 
can do that with your play and make it
instead<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.920> jump<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.100> into

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
instead of this and up jump right into

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.120 
instead of this and up jump right into
it<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.920> whole

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it and going up now actually this whole

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.390 
it and going up now actually this whole
part<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> rising<00:01:33.119> action<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:34.140> about<00:01:34.920> 80%

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
part of the rising action is about 80%

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
part of the rising action is about 80%
of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> play<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.390> most<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.470> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
of the play that's most all of it and in

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
of the play that's most all of it and in
fact<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.189> break<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:38.909> acts

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
fact if you break it down into acts

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.319 
fact if you break it down into acts
we're<00:01:39.720> probably<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.729> act<00:01:42.060> 1

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
we're probably going up here in act 1

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
we're probably going up here in act 1
and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> middle<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and then in the middle of it we have a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
and then in the middle of it we have a
break<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.270> still<00:01:45.479> having<00:01:45.840> rising

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
break and then it's still having rising

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
break and then it's still having rising
action<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> climax<00:01:47.340> happens<00:01:47.759> toward<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
action and the climax happens toward the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.960 
action and the climax happens toward the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
rushing it but not dragging that out

rushing it but not dragging that out
after<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> climax<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> also<00:02:06.180> suggest<00:02:06.840> is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
after the climax what I also suggest is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320 
after the climax what I also suggest is
at<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> end<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> day<00:02:08.160> new<00:02:08.310> ma<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.910> you

some<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.299> touch<00:03:42.510> at<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.720> end<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.139> very

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
some little touch at the end is very

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.110 
some little touch at the end is very
important<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:43.919> structuring<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.519> play<00:03:44.760> as

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
important in structuring the play as

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.689 
important in structuring the play as
you're<00:03:45.989> charting<00:03:46.560> all<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.889> this<00:03:47.040> out<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.549> have

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
you're charting all of this out you have

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.220 
you're charting all of this out you have
your<00:03:47.730> characters<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.930> different

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
your characters and the different

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.599 
your characters and the different
conflicts<00:03:49.709> they're<00:03:49.859> going<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.099> go<00:03:50.250> through

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
conflicts they're going to go through

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.339 
conflicts they're going to go through
different<00:03:51.329> plot<00:03:51.569> points<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.109> know<00:03:52.230> what's

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
different plot points you know what's

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.680 
different plot points you know what's
going<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.530> happen<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:53.040> know<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:54.090> husband<00:03:54.540> is

going to die you know they're gonna get

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.619 
going to die you know they're gonna get
in<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.250> big<00:03:56.430> fight<00:03:56.579> before<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:57.120> maybe<00:03:57.329> one<00:03:57.599> of

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
this on something like note cards if you

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.140 
this on something like note cards if you
can<00:04:04.859> keep<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.129> in<00:04:05.220> your<00:04:05.250> head<00:04:05.400> that's<00:04:05.609> fine<00:04:05.879> but

note<00:04:06.389> cards<00:04:06.720> are<00:04:06.840> very<00:04:06.989> helpful<00:04:07.230> because

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
note cards are very helpful because

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.140 
note cards are very helpful because
you're<00:04:07.889> going<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.099> switch<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.519> order<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.879> lot

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
you're going to switch the order a lot

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.759 
you're going to switch the order a lot
of<00:04:09.359> course<00:04:09.720> if<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.169> spreadsheet

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
of course if you have a spreadsheet

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.729 
of course if you have a spreadsheet
that's<00:04:11.519> very<00:04:11.849> easy<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.209> do<00:04:12.389> too<00:04:12.659> in<00:04:13.440> just

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
that's very easy to do too in just

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.439 
that's very easy to do too in just
switching<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.729> order<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:15.090> things<00:04:15.299> so

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
switching the order of things so

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.779 
switching the order of things so
whatever<00:04:15.720> works<00:04:15.959> out<00:04:16.169> best<00:04:16.440> for<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:17.370> just

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
whatever works out best for you but just

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.420 
whatever works out best for you but just
to<00:04:17.940> get<00:04:18.090> those<00:04:18.299> main<00:04:18.659> points<00:04:19.409> and<00:04:19.620> then<00:04:20.070> switch

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
to get those main points and then switch

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.069 
to get those main points and then switch
those<00:04:20.669> around<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.120> they<00:04:21.239> make<00:04:21.450> sense<00:04:21.750> for<00:04:21.930> you

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
those around so they make sense for you

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.500 
those around so they make sense for you
will<00:04:22.650> really<00:04:22.919> help<00:04:23.099> with<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.460> structure<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.479> a

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
will really help with the structure so a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.350 
will really help with the structure so a
great<00:04:24.750> way<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.930> look<00:04:25.139> at<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.500> like

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
great way to look at it is like

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.749 
great way to look at it is like
you're<00:04:26.750> going<00:04:27.050> on<00:04:27.229> this<00:04:27.409> journey<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:28.490> are<00:04:28.639> the

driver and your characters are the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.860 
driver and your characters are the
passengers<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.729> don't<00:04:32.090> know<00:04:32.180> exactly<00:04:32.629> where

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
passengers you don't know exactly where

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.570 
passengers you don't know exactly where
you're<00:04:33.020> going<00:04:33.379> but<00:04:34.099> you're<00:04:34.129> going<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.400> have<00:04:34.550> a
