00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:21.449
 prepare ice cream from ferrero rocher 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:24.330
 in an easy and fast way we are going to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.760
 occupy half a liter of milk half a liter 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 of water a quarter cup of cocoa in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.320
 powder this is the cocoa that I am 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.360
 using three quarters of a cup 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 sugar can use a full cup 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.899
 but I prefer to use three quarters 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 because if I think it's too much 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.820
 sweet as it deals with chocolates 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.730
 ferrero rocher here the chocolates is at 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 I'm going to make 6 ice creams and I'm going to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.930
 put 12 chocolates because they are for me 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.050
 family if they are to sell you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 they would sex with the penalty of more and in 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
 case they want to do 12 long 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.680
 they would put 12 chocolates we are going to occupy 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 liquid chocolate I also exercised 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.239
 occupy liquid nutella to make the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.550
 art of the liquid let's grab on what 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.430
 what is the nutella let's grab a 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.160
 of this fabric and we're going to combine it with 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 half a cup of warm milk so that it 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.590
 make us liquid in a measuring cup 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.350
 let's put a bag of chocolate 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.320
 exercise liquid to put them with 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.940
 flour an ounce is liquid chocolate 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.370
 and now I'm going to put another bag of 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.830
 liquid nutella here I will continue 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.060
 placing the same measure until you reach 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.060
 that looks two ounces 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.320
 there it is we already have 2 ounces an ounce of 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.450
 you exercise an ounce of nutella in the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.450
 blender I will put the milk 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.869
 the sugar 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.430
 clear as all the ingredients 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.560
 let's put the chocolate together with the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.079
 cloth 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.240
 let's also put the water, I'm going to 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.700
 put a little water in the cup to 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.950
 clean it and remove all the chocolate 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.009
 that I wanted to narrate we're also going to put 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.740
 the average liter of water here but we will 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.280
 take advantage of the water to take out all the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.840
 chocolate we finished putting the water and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.849
 let's put another coin is here 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.730
 depending how many chocolates they want 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.090
 put if they are to sell you in this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.500
 amount we are going to put three chocolates 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.080
 so that they can be served by profit 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.680
 true that if it comes out a little bit expensive this 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.900
 chocolate rather this is a is a luxury 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.090
 or a taste that we can give ourselves for 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.650
 our family I'm going to put five 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.870
 chocolates because the truth is 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.280
 a lot to put 6 but you can put 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.510
 everything you want 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.510
 now we are going to liquefy 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.770
 now let's put in a container 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.090
 to be able to bag now to make 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.910
 our point we are going to put a 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.350
 chocolate in the sachet and ice cream 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.120
 they are to sell they go from 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.310
 chocolate and they're going to put half of the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.720
 chocolate does not suit us to put the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.210
 whole chocolate because it's not going to 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.820
 a lot of profit or maybe we do not 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.730
 there would be nothing of profit we put a 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.130
 cup of the liquid that is not too full 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.530
 we tie the knot to the bag, you know the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.660
 knot goes up so that it appears 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.790
 that the ice cream is bigger when they are 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.500
 For Mendez I will continue doing my 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.420
 ice cream and maybe I'll show you 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.270
 to see how much where they came out with this 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.950
 I got 6 sides left that way 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.690
 the already frozen our ice cream 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.670
