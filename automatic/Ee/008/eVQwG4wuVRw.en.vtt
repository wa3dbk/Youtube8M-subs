00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hey people welcome to this short 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.109
 info video today I would like to see you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.349
 to point out to my next workshop 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.540
 who got back into the topic again 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.929
 mirror reflex photography taking place 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.609
 So it will end with the automatic mode 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.170
 in this workshop as well as the last 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.180
 Let me like you the basics 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.359
 the photography convey it is so 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 around aperture exposure time iso as well 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.550
 rough hood over the whole photograph 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.369
 because you just have to understand that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.820
 to break out of automatic mode 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.170
 can 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.149
 Of course we will also have a look 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
 many other aspects as for example 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.780
 the question is what does the histogram do 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.309
 is an exposure correction or too 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.180
 much on objective so how 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.530
 affect, for example, focal lengths 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 like the last time will be again 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.899
 a model available all day 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.930
 stand 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.750
 that's the linda believe so same 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.609
 like the last time 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.710
 that gives you the advantage that you are 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.439
 can focus on photography 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.909
 can focus on your camera and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.549
 Do not take each other's photos 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.159
 lets that also be very pleasant and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.350
 the whole thing will take place on 28 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.960
 february 2015 in nonnweiler in the beautiful 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
 Saarland directly on the A1 between Trier 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.159
 and saarbrÃ¼cken really very very 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.720
 easy to reach 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.200
 and who wants to come in there? 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.780
 saarland and can together with me and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.400
 like-minded people next to this day 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.189

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.729
 Clock 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.850
 So eight hours full program 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.979
 but divided into theoretical blocks 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.229
 also there of course a lot of practice that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.750
 you all the things also handy 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.850
