00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
individual identity now I think just as

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.729 
individual identity now I think just as
the<00:03:14.900> years<00:03:15.139> go<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:16.060> people<00:03:17.060> see<00:03:17.329> us<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.750> more

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
the years go on people see us as more

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.630 
the years go on people see us as more
and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.030 
and
as<00:03:20.000> individuals<00:03:20.900> which<00:03:21.319> is<00:03:21.350> weird<00:03:21.830> because

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
as individuals which is weird because

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.980 
as individuals which is weird because
we've<00:03:22.370> always<00:03:22.550> been<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:23.240> different<00:03:23.600> people

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
we've always been to different people

we've always been to different people
but<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.650> guess<00:03:25.250> since<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.910> have<00:03:26.060> long<00:03:26.300> hair<00:03:26.569> and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
but I guess since I have long hair and

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.840 
but I guess since I have long hair and
she<00:03:26.870> has<00:03:26.900> short<00:03:27.260> hair<00:03:27.350> now<00:03:27.709> how<00:03:28.459> about<00:03:28.790> a
