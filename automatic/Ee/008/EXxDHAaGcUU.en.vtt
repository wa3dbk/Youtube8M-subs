00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Now it is time to start that are 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.270
 very very good and good then in this video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.200
 I bring you what is one more review 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.019
 show of these long lasting that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.839
 they are of the brand name and that nothing is left 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.060
 I had seen the ones that are blog blasting 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.010
 in choice you who live being 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.140
 Asians are the only ones that I had 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.269
 seen now I had the opportunity to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.330
 try one of them not shown us 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.119
 here because I lost it but the truth was 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.180
 a little bit like that from here 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.149
 inside this part of here the lip 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.910
 you got to hit a lot and it's something that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 I did not like it, you do not blame 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.250
 nothing but I do not like how they stuck and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.320
 I felt like that very very mouth 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.010
 taffy then I did not like it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.700
 now this was known I first tried one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.460
 and I liked it, I loved it too 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.550
 and I said good this one because I do not stay 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.740
 for one more nothing but then this one then 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.970
 I saw that he had taken what is a branch and 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.000
 I said good because I do not know I want 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.120
 here is forward then so the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 night that in broad strokes in this 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.590
 video I'll show you what the 12 are 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.920
 tones because they are two tones of these 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.510
 blacks ring and the truth 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.810
 my verdict I tell you once 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.940
 right now they are some lip gloss that if they are 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.920
 long duration the truth you last a long time 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.470
 drink water while you're talking're 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.510
 eating you last a long time are 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.740
 good the truth because the now do not you 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.550
 I'm going to deny they 're good, no, no, 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.670
 quartean so they split like this 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:47.430
 and protect it for chapped 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 do not do not behave and the fact that you 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.500
 is laughing or you're talking either 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.380
 makes it obvious that it is denigrated 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.320
 you are chupi chupi the lips remember 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.119
 that pomegranate saliva is the food 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.590
 and say so and it's also going to start 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.630
 to degrade what is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.569
 the brake lip as I explain what 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.760
 feels this is so comfortable despite the fact that 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.239
 it's mate he feels it's so comfortable that he does not 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 it dries your lips and allows you to 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.010
 say it then you comfortable 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.049
 We are doing this allows it and 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.569
 that's something that I liked about 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.670
 these lipsticks of salhiyÃ© that 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.060
 they are definitely of a formula 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.579
 totally different from those of 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.980
 generation ' although it comes very similar 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.209
 because to bring this part of here 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.489
