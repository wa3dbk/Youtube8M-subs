00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
really really frustrating so I was gonna

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.289

start<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.250> rant<00:03:32.430> at<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.670> end<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.120> guess

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
start the rant at the end but I guess

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.850 
start the rant at the end but I guess
we'll<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.480> go<00:03:33.690> with<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.900> right<00:03:33.989> now<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.350> think

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
know and again I've always thought you

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.050 
know and again I've always thought you
know<00:04:55.800> said<00:04:56.130> can<00:04:56.280> you<00:04:56.310> guys<00:04:56.520> sign<00:04:56.730> a<00:04:56.760> petition

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
know said can you guys sign a petition

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.200 
know said can you guys sign a petition
so<00:04:57.870> we<00:04:58.020> can<00:04:58.200> have<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.410> small<00:04:59.040> things<00:04:59.310> small<00:05:00.060> maps

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
so we can have a small things small maps

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.120 
so we can have a small things small maps
like<00:05:00.390> burning<00:05:00.630> shrine<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.050> anomaly<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.680> really

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
like burning shrine and anomaly I really

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.410 
like burning shrine and anomaly I really
think<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:02.460> would<00:05:02.550> mixing<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.000> up<00:05:03.090> because<00:05:03.300> I

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
think that would mixing it up because I

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.730 
think that would mixing it up because I
feel<00:05:03.540> like<00:05:03.570> sometimes<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:04.020> just<00:05:04.140> it<00:05:04.530> gets<00:05:04.710> a

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
feel like sometimes it just it gets a

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.230 
feel like sometimes it just it gets a
little<00:05:04.830> stale<00:05:05.130> playing<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.460> same<00:05:05.670> maps<00:05:05.910> over

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
little stale playing the same maps over

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.970 
little stale playing the same maps over
at<00:05:06.300> all<00:05:06.390> or<00:05:06.720> perhaps<00:05:07.260> give<00:05:07.530> us<00:05:07.620> like<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.770> map

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
at all or perhaps give us like a map

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.190 
at all or perhaps give us like a map
voting<00:05:08.310> system<00:05:08.730> like<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.540> know<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.900> call<00:05:10.110> of

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
voting system like you know the call of

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.750 
voting system like you know the call of
duty<00:05:10.230> drones<00:05:10.680> have<00:05:10.920> to<00:05:11.100> get<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.340> vote<00:05:11.370> for<00:05:11.520> a

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
duty drones have to get to vote for a

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.910 
duty drones have to get to vote for a
map<00:05:11.910> at<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.330> end<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.660> each<00:05:12.750> match<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.800> we

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
map at the end of each match and I we

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.620 
map at the end of each match and I we
say<00:05:14.130> anomaly<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.670> burning<00:05:14.940> shrikes<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.390> think

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
say anomaly and burning shrikes I think

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.050 
say anomaly and burning shrikes I think
those<00:05:15.810> would<00:05:15.960> be<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.110> lot<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.470> fun<00:05:16.680> in<00:05:17.370> control<00:05:18.030> I

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
those would be a lot of fun in control I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.150 
those would be a lot of fun in control I
think<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:18.600> don't<00:05:18.780> know<00:05:18.870> no<00:05:19.260> I<00:05:19.440> mean<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:19.920> just
