00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.399
 not only plastic stubborn there is behind the paint in Dithmarschen but 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.369
 also real white storks from flesh and blood 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.880
 in the meadows and pastures the birds find their food 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.420
 The carnage Mieste allowed a mast in a paddock on the outskirts of the village 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.020
 as the stork warns he was wearing the name of his female 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.040
 When the two moved to the South last fall, they bet different 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.960
 ways 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.150
 Gerd Roth flight on the western route to Tanzania USI unfortunately deadly 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.810
 unsuccessful 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.890
 Helmut, on the other hand, had Merkel 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.090
 Thanks to the small transmitter on his back, the ornithologists of the NABU know 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
 exactly where he spent the winter 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.410
 Helmut flight to the southwest crossed France and the Pyrenees and 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.840
 then decided to stay in Spain 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.570
 with thousands of other stubborn upper-winters he's near big 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.660
 Landfills south of Madrid 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.430
 What seems unappetizing to us is a stubborn one for the stubborn 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 laid table 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.870
 The way back to the breeding area is not far and so Helmut Sampt was allowed to be 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.240
 punctually back to the basement can 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.259
 What happened then RZ stork father Helmut Kohl 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.160
 NOK we have learned to save 600 here with us 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.760
 What we could watch on TV Internet 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.850
 and l 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 but at first RIAA Marvin forced that sat 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.550
 but he was easy to read to Brig 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.640
 Bruno we knew the woman will not come back 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.300
 Pavlov, he has bathed and left construction community 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 all the time about unha-2 and Dirty Days 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:15.269
 Bathed on his wife and I all the time over at the several disturbers her 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.989
 all the hair chased away 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.209
 and percent 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.159
 Strangers we look "The war can 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.269
 but on the 17th of April 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.389
 Morning stood 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
 so that second bothered more is the 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.399
 is 80 years old is going to be 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.209
 Brandenburg 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.079
 there has been thought 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.719
 2002 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.629
 Asher lay 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.200
 since the years since the European Championships and go that's all a great love Lyon 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.799
 as it should be November year still was it completely 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.329
 happy under pressure 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.329
 "That's how it came 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.070
 now it is first 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.839
 to prepare the nest 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.939
 more and more respect are brought in and carefully anchored 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.679
 but actually Helmut has something completely different in mind 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.519
 Undeterred he makes his new companion the court 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.299
 and finally she agrees 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.699
 ten times a day or more frequently the storks mate at the beginning of the 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.699
 Breeding season and soon lay the first eggs in the nest 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.349
 it is evening at the stork's nest and laughed 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.459
 In the last light of day, the female returns from foraging 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.459
 she is being tested by her partner 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.149
 and while the night falls over Dithmarschen is for ours 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.039
 Stork pair of action is far from over 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.609
 no doubt the two agree
