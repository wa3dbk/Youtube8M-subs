and<00:00:22.769> once<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.880> found<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> should<00:00:24.630> be

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and once you have found it it should be

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
and once you have found it it should be
from<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> mod<00:00:25.260> my<00:00:25.500> repo<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
from the mod my repo and it is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.730 
from the mod my repo and it is
completely<00:00:27.750> free<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:29.779> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.080> pretty<00:00:31.380> much<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
completely free so this is pretty much a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.310 
completely free so this is pretty much a
theming<00:00:32.369> application<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.450> winterboard<00:00:34.050> but

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
theming application like winterboard but

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.250 
theming application like winterboard but
in<00:00:34.500> my<00:00:34.739> opinion<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.520> ton<00:00:35.850> better<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.840> once

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
in my opinion it's a ton better so once

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.660 
in my opinion it's a ton better so once
you<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.469> found<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.219> install

to<00:02:34.350> war<00:02:34.470> was<00:02:34.590> great<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.070> while<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.820> after

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
to war was great for a while but after

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.870 
to war was great for a while but after
four<00:02:36.870> point<00:02:37.140> oh<00:02:37.310> winterboard<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.580> shown<00:02:38.850> to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
four point oh winterboard was shown to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.480 
four point oh winterboard was shown to
slow<00:02:39.630> down<00:02:39.780> your<00:02:39.960> device<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> lot<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> just

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
slow down your device a lot so I just

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.820 
slow down your device a lot so I just
stopped<00:02:41.760> using<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.270> because<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.200> thought<00:02:43.770> it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
stopped using it because I thought it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.950 
stopped using it because I thought it
also<00:02:44.250> slowed<00:02:44.490> down<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.790> my<00:02:44.910> device<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.570> now

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
also slowed down to my device and now

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.590 
also slowed down to my device and now
that<00:02:46.140> dream<00:02:46.320> board<00:02:46.560> has<00:02:46.710> come<00:02:46.950> out<00:02:47.070> I

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that dream board has come out I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.150 
that dream board has come out I
completely<00:02:48.600> love<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.650> compared<00:02:50.070> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
completely love it compared to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.610 
completely love it compared to
winterboard<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.750> think<00:02:51.960> it's<00:02:52.170> really

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
winterboard and I just think it's really

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.950 
winterboard and I just think it's really
good<00:02:53.010> because<00:02:53.460> not<00:02:53.880> only<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.420> faster<00:02:54.630> than

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
good because not only is it faster than

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.200 
good because not only is it faster than
winterboard<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.740> also<00:02:56.160> easier<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.030> select

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
winterboard it's also easier to select

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.050 
winterboard it's also easier to select
