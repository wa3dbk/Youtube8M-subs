00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.490
 with whom we will know the dysplasia of 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.990
 hip an official radiograph of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.170
 dysplasia that we're going to make you a shepherd 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.170
 German 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.400
 and today we have here in the clinic 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.830
 veterinary to get an x-ray 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.720
 control of hip dysplasia 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.340
 Vargas explains what this is 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.990
 specific test an x-ray 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.460
 dysplasia officer what are we going to do to him 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.169
 to a German shepherd then it 's a 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.279
 X-ray in which it has to be 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.099
 perfectly determined and without place 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.329
 no doubt to what dog are we 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.730
 doing the x-ray then they are 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.079
 plates that are framed with some letters 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 lead to make it so 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.140
 indelible marked on the plate 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.870
 dog tattoo number the name 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.690
 of the dog and the date of birth 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.670
 name of the owner and the date of the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 date to which we will make the plate 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 wolf you will see as once we do 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.910
 the plate remain marked for 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.190
 always here is a lot of bitch for a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.079
 only person, her owner is delighted 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.429
 can collaborate 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.949
 Well now what we are going to do is going 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.259
 to be administered intravenously 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.170
 a sedative with a muscle relaxant 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.030
 to get the optimal relaxation for 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.570
 be able to do the x-ray that we have 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.570
 commented before the precious good 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 all right 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.910
 Oh, what a drunken stupor 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.580
 we would not know if they were going to do it 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 an x-ray with a ray session 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.350
 grape so that this piece is brown 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.240
 dysplasia is a pretty disease 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.560
 common about which we have a lot to 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.170
 to learn 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 benito updates us the after is a 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.979
 bad congruence between the cavity that 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.170
 collects the acetabulum and the head of the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.259
 Femur and dysplasia indicate poor training 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.020
 poor development then it's a problem 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.450
 because they are animals that puppies do not 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.759
 you notice nothing in general and that 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.619
 as they develop in the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.450
 time to manifest the theology theme 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.979
 when symptomatology starts from in 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.979
 general mobility problems 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.600
 important that is hip dysplasia 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.030
 then there is officially that area 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.340
 orography per year for some plus 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.810
 race to certify that singles have 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.150
 a hip dysplasia so that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.860
 it is permissible for them to be used 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.200
 as stallions or as breeding animals in 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.209
 general when then airbrushing is 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.980
 does it have to be identified with one with 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.630
 a specific method in which 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.360
 identify the name of the animal 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.940
 the tattoo date birth owner 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.290
 and the grace counselor is a 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.210
 special position the one that had to be 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.430
 the animal face up the dow jones and of 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.900
 how it has been seen in the previous religion 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.700
 so that it can be appreciated 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.560
 perfectly the relationship between 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.060
 the head of the femur and the acetabulum 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.680
 it is this area that is here and that collects 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.400
 the song asia does not have to be 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.770
 bilateral this chain is fine is seen in 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.170
 a good relationship between the head of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.130
 femur 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.130
 and the hip 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.570
 the rounded head has a shape 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.550
 happened in this area here the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.320
 acetabulum collects well in this series 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.450
 also very good as the head fits 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.890
 perfectly in the acetabulum there are 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.920
 many factors that contribute to your 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.700
 development and that we can avoid this is 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.340
 an overweight exercise 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.840
 the excess calories in the diet all 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.580
 that combined with a genetic 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.650
 inadequate makes the incidence of 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.180
 hip facts are much higher not 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.569
 we must trust because our 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.739
 dogs are of small breeds 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:38.019
 the most traditional German shepherds 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:41.090
 Rottweiler Labradors and Mastiff Boxers 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.650
 we choose the big dogs the dogs 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.980
 small although they are dysplasia of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.200
 hip by not generating symptoms in 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.359
 adults because there is less emphasis on 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.969
 the surveillance is to say the bigger 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.799
 is a dog a hip dysplasia what 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.510
 that entails is a way out of the head 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.909
 of the femur outside the cavity that 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.879
 collects what is this that is an acceptable 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.260
 it is congruent and this one is out 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.049
 your site is virtually no outside 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.730
 is the one used and we are convinced of 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.620
 that this information will be of 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.859
 great utility to all owners 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.859
 dog's
