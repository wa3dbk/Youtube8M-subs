00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
me just get a little side-by-side here

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
me just get a little side-by-side here
of<00:01:52.829> both<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> watches<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.659> see

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of both the watches so now you can see

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.880 
of both the watches so now you can see
the<00:01:55.110> original<00:01:55.310> Supermarine<00:01:56.310> next<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
the original Supermarine next to the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
the original Supermarine next to the
s2000<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.640> bigger<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
s2000 and you can see that's bigger you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.480 
s2000 and you can see that's bigger you
can<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> dial<00:02:01.469> color<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> little<00:02:02.280> bit

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
can see the dial color is a little bit

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.459 
can see the dial color is a little bit
different<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.420> most<00:02:03.570> part<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
different but for the most part when it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.020 
different but for the most part when it
comes<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> case<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.579> everything<00:02:05.790> like

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
comes to the case and everything like

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.880 
comes to the case and everything like
that<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.420> basically<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.079> same<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.740> have

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890

this watch is the sapphire inlay around
the<00:02:49.860> bezel<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.640> watch<00:02:50.850> came<00:02:51.150> out<00:02:51.330> when<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the bezel this watch came out when that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.940 
the bezel this watch came out when that
was<00:02:51.750> sort<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> popular<00:02:52.440> thing<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.769> do

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
was sort of the popular thing to do

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.380 
was sort of the popular thing to do
today<00:02:53.310> more<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.610> more<00:02:53.760> people<00:02:53.880> are<00:02:54.269> using

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
today more and more people are using

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.300 
today more and more people are using
ceramic<00:02:55.019> ones<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.560> happen<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
ceramic ones but I happen to like the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.650 
ceramic ones but I happen to like the
Sapphire<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.209> very<00:02:57.269> scratch

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
Sapphire it's it's very scratch

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.170 
Sapphire it's it's very scratch
resistant<00:02:58.519> possibly<00:02:59.519> even<00:02:59.670> more<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.030> than

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
resistant possibly even more so than

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.110 
resistant possibly even more so than
ceramic<00:03:00.720> but<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:01.019> at<00:03:01.170> least<00:03:01.349> at<00:03:01.530> least<00:03:01.560> as<00:03:01.890> much

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
ceramic but or at least at least as much

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.400 
ceramic but or at least at least as much
and<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.239> creates<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:03.599> nice<00:03:03.780> sort<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.080> shiny

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
and it creates this nice sort of shiny

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.229 
and it creates this nice sort of shiny
look<00:03:04.739> there<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.549> let's<00:03:05.819> see<00:03:05.940> what's<00:03:06.090> different

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
look there so let's see what's different

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.490 
look there so let's see what's different
you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.630> tell<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.930> there's<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.200> little<00:03:07.410> bit

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
you can tell that there's a little bit

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.559 
you can tell that there's a little bit
of<00:03:07.530> red<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.549> part<00:03:08.880> right<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.060> with<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.330> loom

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
of red this part right here with a loom

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.660 
of red this part right here with a loom
pip<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.019> at<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> top<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.590> red<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.069> not<00:03:11.310> on

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
pip is at the top is red it is not on

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.820 
pip is at the top is red it is not on
the<00:03:11.940> older<00:03:12.510> one<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.410> actually<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.799> whole

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
the older one and actually the whole

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.800 
the older one and actually the whole
bezel<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.519> loomed<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.180> that's<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.540> that's<00:03:15.660> a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
bezel is loomed so that's it that's a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.880 
bezel is loomed so that's it that's a
different<00:03:16.140> thing<00:03:16.170> here<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.590> they're<00:03:16.739> both

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
different thing here so they're both

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.650 
different thing here so they're both
fully<00:03:17.340> loom<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:17.910> not<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.299> tip<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
fully loom so it's not just the tip and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.960 
fully loom so it's not just the tip and
then<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.170> see<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.470> red<00:03:19.680> end<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.489> seconds

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
then you see the red end of the seconds

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.670 
then you see the red end of the seconds
hand<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.870> where<00:03:22.019> has<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> water<00:03:22.470> resistance

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
hand and where has the water resistance

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.830 
hand and where has the water resistance
it's<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.609> is<00:03:23.790> red<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> original<00:03:24.480> was

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
it's it is red so the original was

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.289 
it's it is red so the original was
water-resistant<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> 500<00:03:26.220> meters<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
water-resistant to 500 meters and the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.979 
water-resistant to 500 meters and the
s2000<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.459> water-resistant<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.959> 2,000<00:03:30.959> meters

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
s2000 is water-resistant to 2,000 meters

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.590 
s2000 is water-resistant to 2,000 meters
that's<00:03:31.350> where<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:32.250> where<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.600> 2000s

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
that's where the that's where the 2000s

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.960 
that's where the that's where the 2000s
mm<00:03:34.230> part<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.560> comes<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.670> they<00:03:35.760> both

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
mm part of it comes in and they both

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.690 
mm part of it comes in and they both
share<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> same<00:03:36.630> movement<00:03:37.190> which<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.400> their<00:03:38.670> I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
share the same movement which is their I

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.800 
share the same movement which is their I
think<00:03:38.819> they<00:03:39.060> called<00:03:39.269> them<00:03:39.470> ba<00:03:40.470> or<00:03:40.859> BAE<00:03:41.250> 36<00:03:42.090> it's

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
think they called them ba or BAE 36 it's

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.150 
think they called them ba or BAE 36 it's
a<00:03:42.930> variation<00:03:43.319> on<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:44.639> Swiss<00:03:45.030> Edda<00:03:45.920> 2836<00:03:46.920> which

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
a variation on the Swiss Edda 2836 which

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.000 
a variation on the Swiss Edda 2836 which
is<00:03:47.340> their<00:03:47.579> three<00:03:48.180> hand<00:03:48.389> watch<00:03:49.200> with<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.739> day

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
is their three hand watch with the day

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.270 
is their three hand watch with the day
as<00:03:50.790> well<00:03:51.239> as<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.600> date<00:03:51.840> okay<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.920> let's<00:03:53.160> go

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
as well as the date okay so let's go

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.599 
as well as the date okay so let's go
back<00:03:53.430> onto<00:03:53.639> this<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.150> now<00:03:54.590> with<00:03:55.590> 2000<00:03:56.340> metres

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
back onto this one now with 2000 metres

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.940 
back onto this one now with 2000 metres
of<00:03:56.819> water<00:03:56.850> resistance<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.900> are<00:03:57.930> going<00:03:58.769> to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
of water resistance you are going to

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.920 
of water resistance you are going to
remain<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.670> as<00:03:59.880> alive<00:04:00.180> as<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.569> were<00:04:00.690> going

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
remain just as alive as you were going

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.660 
remain just as alive as you were going
to<00:04:01.079> be<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> regular<00:04:02.069> Supermarine<00:04:02.639> I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
to be with the regular Supermarine I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.949 
to be with the regular Supermarine I
don't<00:04:03.000> really<00:04:03.180> think<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.389> makes<00:04:03.630> much<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.810> a

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
don't really think that makes much of a

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.509 
don't really think that makes much of a
difference<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.410> sort<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.650> an<00:04:04.799> increase<00:04:05.340> in

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
difference so sort of an increase in

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.599 
difference so sort of an increase in
that<00:04:05.549> in<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.180> coolness<00:04:06.420> factor<00:04:06.810> for<00:04:07.620> sure<00:04:07.889> but

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
that in the coolness factor for sure but

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.430 
that in the coolness factor for sure but
you<00:04:08.850> know<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.000> mean<00:04:09.329> it's<00:04:09.510> they're<00:04:09.959> both<00:04:10.170> very

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
you know I mean it's they're both very

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.990 
you know I mean it's they're both very
very<00:04:10.680> durable<00:04:10.980> watches<00:04:11.519> they<00:04:11.609> just<00:04:11.790> sort<00:04:11.910> of

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
very durable watches they just sort of

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.550 
very durable watches they just sort of
you<00:04:12.540> know<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.660> think<00:04:12.780> what<00:04:13.019> they<00:04:13.109> really<00:04:13.139> want

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
you know I think what they really want

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.170 
you know I think what they really want
to<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.769> is<00:04:13.889> create<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.250> larger<00:04:14.639> one<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:14.819> this<00:04:15.030> one

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
to do is create a larger one so this one

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.170 
to do is create a larger one so this one
is<00:04:15.329> 45<00:04:15.930> millimeters<00:04:16.620> wide<00:04:16.919> whereas<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
is 45 millimeters wide whereas the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.649 
is 45 millimeters wide whereas the
original<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:19.169> was<00:04:19.320> 43<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:21.209> can<00:04:21.359> tell<00:04:21.510> it's

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
original one was 43 you can tell it's

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.290 
original one was 43 you can tell it's
not<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.840> huge<00:04:22.380> difference<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:23.090> I'll<00:04:24.090> put<00:04:24.210> them

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
not a huge difference but I'll put them

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.850 
not a huge difference but I'll put them
on<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.479> wrist<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.169> can<00:04:25.320> see<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:25.650> let<00:04:25.800> me

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
between how it looks on the rubber strap

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.150 
between how it looks on the rubber strap
as<00:04:56.849> well<00:04:57.060> as<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.240> bracelet<00:04:57.979> one<00:04:58.979> of<00:04:59.069> the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
as well as the bracelet one of the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.650 
as well as the bracelet one of the
things<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.430> really<00:04:59.849> like<00:05:00.060> about<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.479> new

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
things I really like about the new

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.710 
things I really like about the new
version<00:05:00.900> is<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.860> sort<00:05:02.099> of<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.880> wider<00:05:03.180> loom<00:05:03.570> I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
version is this sort of the wider loom I

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.570 
version is this sort of the wider loom I
think<00:05:03.900> they<00:05:03.990> use<00:05:04.139> actually<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.530> blue<00:05:04.800> loom<00:05:05.070> so

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
think they use actually the blue loom so

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.980 
think they use actually the blue loom so
the<00:05:05.699> other<00:05:05.820> one<00:05:06.000> uses<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> traditional<00:05:06.479> green

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
the other one uses a traditional green

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.570 
the other one uses a traditional green
loom<00:05:07.199> but<00:05:07.349> this<00:05:07.470> one<00:05:07.620> use<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.130> blue<00:05:08.340> loom

loom but this one use the the blue loom
and<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.210> blue<00:05:09.389> loom<00:05:09.660> when<00:05:10.650> it's<00:05:10.800> painted<00:05:11.160> on

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
and the blue loom when it's painted on

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.279 
and the blue loom when it's painted on
it<00:05:11.430> looks<00:05:11.610> more<00:05:11.820> white<00:05:12.090> so<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.810> have<00:05:12.960> more<00:05:13.259> of

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
it looks more white so you have more of

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.529 
it looks more white so you have more of
a<00:05:13.410> high<00:05:13.590> contrast<00:05:14.039> dial<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:15.180> one<00:05:15.389> is<00:05:15.509> a

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
a high contrast dial this one is a

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.850 
a high contrast dial this one is a
little<00:05:15.720> bit<00:05:15.960> more<00:05:16.080> greenish<00:05:16.410> which<00:05:16.740> I

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
little bit more greenish which I

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.710 
little bit more greenish which I
actually<00:05:17.009> liked<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.580> enjoyed<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.449> I<00:05:18.509> also

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
actually liked I enjoyed it but I also

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.540 
actually liked I enjoyed it but I also
very<00:05:19.020> much<00:05:19.139> like<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:19.740> this<00:05:19.949> wider<00:05:20.250> color

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
very much like this this wider color

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.129 
very much like this this wider color
here<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.330> little<00:05:21.509> hints<00:05:21.780> of<00:05:21.840> red<00:05:21.900> are

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
here and the little hints of red are

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.930 
here and the little hints of red are
nice<00:05:22.289> as<00:05:22.470> well<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.830> have<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.220> feeling<00:05:23.669> that<00:05:23.789> there

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
nice as well I have a feeling that there

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.309 
nice as well I have a feeling that there
will<00:05:24.060> come<00:05:24.240> they<00:05:24.599> will<00:05:24.750> come<00:05:24.900> out<00:05:24.930> with<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.139> few

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
will come they will come out with a few

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.469 
will come they will come out with a few
different<00:05:25.620> colors<00:05:26.009> this<00:05:26.819> kind<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.180> just<00:05:27.360> this

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
different colors this kind of just this

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.059 
different colors this kind of just this
is<00:05:27.630> like<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.780> soft<00:05:28.139> Blanc<00:05:28.500> it's<00:05:28.740> not<00:05:28.860> really

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
is like a soft Blanc it's not really

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.740 
is like a soft Blanc it's not really

you<00:05:31.740> can<00:05:31.860> buy<00:05:32.009> these<00:05:32.070> yet<00:05:32.490> at<00:05:32.909> least<00:05:33.000> by<00:05:33.240> the

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
you can buy these yet at least by the

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.089 
you can buy these yet at least by the
time<00:05:33.570> I<00:05:33.599> probably<00:05:34.139> post<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:34.800> you<00:05:34.919> might<00:05:35.070> be

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
time I probably post this you might be

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.189 
time I probably post this you might be
able<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.520> be<00:05:35.639> in<00:05:36.240> this<00:05:36.419> one<00:05:36.630> when<00:05:36.780> it<00:05:36.810> came<00:05:37.020> out

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
able to be in this one when it came out

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.999 
able to be in this one when it came out
it<00:05:37.530> came<00:05:37.919> out<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:39.349> want<00:05:40.349> to<00:05:40.409> say<00:05:40.530> like<00:05:40.680> three

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
it came out in I want to say like three

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.379 
it came out in I want to say like three
or<00:05:41.159> four<00:05:41.190> different<00:05:41.699> colors<00:05:41.970> there<00:05:42.150> was<00:05:42.270> this

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
or four different colors there was this

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.360 
or four different colors there was this
black<00:05:42.659> dial<00:05:43.080> there<00:05:43.440> was<00:05:43.590> like<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.710> silver<00:05:44.190> one

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
black dial there was like a silver one

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.010 
black dial there was like a silver one
and<00:05:44.430> there<00:05:45.210> might<00:05:45.330> have<00:05:45.419> been<00:05:45.509> one<00:05:45.659> more<00:05:45.870> but

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
and there might have been one more but

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.149 
and there might have been one more but
there's<00:05:46.139> at<00:05:46.229> least<00:05:46.259> a<00:05:46.469> few<00:05:46.590> different<00:05:46.889> one<00:05:46.979> so

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
there's at least a few different one so

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.620 
there's at least a few different one so
I<00:05:47.190> suspect<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.669> Bramante's<00:05:48.180> gonna<00:05:48.360> do<00:05:48.509> the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
I suspect that Bramante's gonna do the

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.219 
I suspect that Bramante's gonna do the
precise<00:05:49.020> same<00:05:49.770> thing<00:05:50.419> with<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.539> s2000

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
precise same thing with the s2000

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.990 
precise same thing with the s2000
overall<00:05:52.740> it's<00:05:52.860> a<00:05:52.919> great<00:05:53.070> timepiece<00:05:53.460> if<00:05:53.880> you

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
overall it's a great timepiece if you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.360 
overall it's a great timepiece if you
already<00:05:54.539> have<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.780> Supermarine<00:05:55.560> do<00:05:56.099> you<00:05:56.190> need

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
already have a Supermarine do you need

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.700 
already have a Supermarine do you need
to<00:05:56.460> upgrade<00:05:56.669> I<00:05:57.210> don't<00:05:57.780> call<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.380> an<00:05:58.560> upgrade

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
to upgrade I don't call it an upgrade

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.120 
to upgrade I don't call it an upgrade
because<00:05:59.130> it's<00:05:59.310> very<00:05:59.849> similar<00:06:00.770> but<00:06:01.770> you<00:06:01.919> might

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
because it's very similar but you might

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.290 
because it's very similar but you might
want<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.370> get<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.520> different<00:06:02.849> one<00:06:03.000> if<00:06:03.120> it's<00:06:03.240> a

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
want to get a different one if it's a

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.730 
want to get a different one if it's a
different<00:06:03.479> color<00:06:03.780> something<00:06:04.110> like<00:06:04.349> that<00:06:04.530> you

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
different color something like that you

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.110 
different color something like that you
know<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:04.860> think<00:06:04.949> diehard<00:06:05.430> Brad<00:06:05.639> my<00:06:05.759> fans<00:06:06.000> were

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
know I think diehard Brad my fans were

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.279 
know I think diehard Brad my fans were
definitely<00:06:06.449> gonna<00:06:06.539> get<00:06:06.750> it<00:06:06.870> if<00:06:06.990> you<00:06:07.259> don't

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
definitely gonna get it if you don't

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.529 
definitely gonna get it if you don't
have<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.889> Supermarine<00:06:08.580> now<00:06:09.030> you<00:06:09.090> just<00:06:09.330> have<00:06:09.509> a

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
have a Supermarine now you just have a

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.879 
have a Supermarine now you just have a
different<00:06:09.960> option<00:06:10.320> if<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.530> wanted<00:06:10.800> a

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
different option if you wanted a

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.560 
different option if you wanted a
slightly<00:06:11.130> larger<00:06:11.400> one<00:06:11.639> I<00:06:11.940> wouldn't<00:06:12.389> say<00:06:12.539> that

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
slightly larger one I wouldn't say that

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.120 
slightly larger one I wouldn't say that
one<00:06:12.870> is<00:06:12.990> inherently<00:06:13.380> better<00:06:13.620> than<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:14.009> other

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
one is inherently better than the other

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.370 
one is inherently better than the other
from<00:06:14.729> a<00:06:14.820> price<00:06:15.060> perspective<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.930> don't<00:06:15.960> have

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
from a price perspective I don't have

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.959 
from a price perspective I don't have
the<00:06:16.530> official<00:06:16.830> pricing<00:06:17.250> right<00:06:17.340> now<00:06:17.520> for<00:06:17.820> the

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
the official pricing right now for the

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:19.969 
the official pricing right now for the
s2000<00:06:18.719> I<00:06:18.810> believe<00:06:19.380> it's<00:06:19.560> going<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.800> be<00:06:19.949> a

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
s2000 I believe it's going to be a

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.129 
s2000 I believe it's going to be a
little<00:06:20.190> bit<00:06:20.430> more<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.840> normal

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
little bit more the the normal

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.469 
little bit more the the normal
Supermarine<00:06:22.710> was<00:06:23.099> just<00:06:23.580> over<00:06:23.759> five<00:06:23.969> thousand

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
Supermarine was just over five thousand

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.689 
Supermarine was just over five thousand
bucks<00:06:24.680> so<00:06:25.680> I'm<00:06:25.800> gonna<00:06:25.919> assume<00:06:26.039> that<00:06:26.190> this<00:06:26.490> one

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
bucks so I'm gonna assume that this one

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.719 
bucks so I'm gonna assume that this one
is<00:06:26.849> probably<00:06:27.270> a<00:06:27.990> few<00:06:28.800> hundred<00:06:28.830> dollars<00:06:29.159> more

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
is probably a few hundred dollars more

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.310 
is probably a few hundred dollars more
maybe<00:06:29.940> as<00:06:30.120> much<00:06:30.270> as<00:06:30.330> a<00:06:30.479> thousand<00:06:30.930> dollars<00:06:31.139> more

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
maybe as much as a thousand dollars more

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.629 
maybe as much as a thousand dollars more
I<00:06:31.380> wouldn't<00:06:31.620> suspect<00:06:31.800> it's<00:06:32.130> too<00:06:32.280> much<00:06:32.430> more

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
I wouldn't suspect it's too much more

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.360 
I wouldn't suspect it's too much more
than<00:06:32.759> that<00:06:32.909> so<00:06:33.090> figure<00:06:33.330> something<00:06:33.690> around<00:06:33.900> the

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
than that so figure something around the
