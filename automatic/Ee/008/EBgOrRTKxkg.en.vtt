00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.680 
and the secret of this brush is that
it's<00:02:22.530> really<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.519> gentle<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.239> your<00:02:24.300> hair<00:02:24.450> I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
mean I try the Denman which looks like

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360 
mean I try the Denman which looks like
this<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.410> nowhere<00:02:28.590> near<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:29.190> this

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
this but it's nowhere near like this

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.789 
this but it's nowhere near like this
because<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.390> use<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.870> basically<00:02:31.140> does<00:02:31.440> not
