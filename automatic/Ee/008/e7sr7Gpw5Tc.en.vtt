00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.170
 or for example the time passes more slowly in the ravine is that here where 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.369
 we are now because we are on a first or second floor 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.139
 and that is indeed the case and the measures have been taken and it has been proven 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.269
 so that the people who are on the ravine invent more boss 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.519
 slowly that you and I bustillo 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.330
 It's true that if we spent our whole lives with this difference in 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.159
 rhythms of the passage of time peace in the end the difference would be only about 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:36.510
 millionths of a second and above possess that Ecuadorian quito is not worth 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.690
 but but the fact that time and space have their own dynamics 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.070
 that was a tremendous revolution we are a little bus 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.070
 all that since you know and pangal and I was excited about the theory of 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.380
 relativity because it seemed to offer to its realism the idea that reality does not 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.949
 can only be reduced only temporary flow 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.310
 it has been produced 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.720
 dovizioso in the most famous picture of dahlias the persistence of memory 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.940
 appear a kind of soft watches miter watches 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.050
 in 10 to the image suggests that in the same space are expressed different 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.600
 temporalities was impotent after 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.090
 surprisingly 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.829
 dalí claimed that soft watches inspired us in the theory of 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:26.700
 relativity 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.660
 but in the perception on list of a camembert cheese being able to the sun 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.040
 the painter insisted on this explanation in his response to the letter of wheat without 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.450
 style interpreted as a reaction to the mathematical coldness of the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.830
 einstein theory 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.330
 authorities in the state there is and placed the time 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
 day places a time that has no address 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.320
 indeci the future is the same as the past is essentially this way of this 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.060
 mode 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.009
 and be effective and that time is always an illusion megaphone but cheese 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.310
 that melts 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.100
 and it does not have an address 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.770
 an example is the same the future of which on its past those days the objects 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.309
 they are transformed in a direction there an evolution 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:20.069
 I do not know not only in plants animals humans but also 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.149
 in the things of egypt say ali in the background pound takes up the idea of ​​time 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:31.339
 forced to leave that money between things and in that I am Dalinian 100% the 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.339
 time this reality and has 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.919
 grrrr 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:42.629
 becker there are other members he was fugitive to back them up the 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.519
 they receive on earth 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.519
 the pp knows how to retain inside the dome 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.039
 I must be habitable 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.219
 morals 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.269
 all with the new composite spectator 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.839
 the voice and go p 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:59.629
 for their real
