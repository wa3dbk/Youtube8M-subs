00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.880
 Poets come now 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.370
 and here very limited and the field goes on the journey 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.359
 to the Sittener NDB Kurt Schultz seers really separate now 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.500
 the candidates they are overwrought on the way reason for it is looking for 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.400
 equal to his 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.490
 To make lengths out of the dust now I have to see that they have the award 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.939
 a investigator 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.869
 the DS Canmore Ka 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.430
 Money market clearly ahead in the lead investors in second position ago 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.780
 like Frank o 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.090
 then 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.380
 Vicari and then behind 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.220
 Callebaut's next leap with distinct advantage jumped a bit 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.940
 hesitant 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.350
 behind it you suddenly see more is in the second position everyone likes 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.730
 with it behind you can also see Alanko galloping at the end of the field 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.090
 The Robots is how it works for the first time 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.990
 Gottingen helm 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.350
 unfamiliar in the enema final under the leadership of Elmar Kramer 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.020
 clear advantage 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.890
 the next jump is coming up 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.260
 Elmar Karl, a long way behind, sees Mattern Alleghe other geisha 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.920
 stayed for the DS Alanko 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.340
 then you see how Cario supports the field is Zer Obama's 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.780
 now you can see the ferry 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.369
 Halbach Denmark it is now a gossip same we do for the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.410
 others immediately, they already see 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.520
 Pretty I can now leave the heels of Halbach 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.670
 all riders are in the saddle so far an outstanding race Helmar came on 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.340
 fastest by the lake the projection but melted together now 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.710
 Applause from them that's nice 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.330
 Helmar KFOR policy and everyone likes BtMG step peace like Chariot 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.329
 then Alanko 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.899
 and then this sorbas the field Weigelt far apart 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.659
 under the leadership of Helmar Callebaut Gamble drama hole over he has on 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.120
 on road 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.459
 and alone on further corridor the vet 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.340
 in the other side alone on the next jump to Halvar the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.230
 clear advantage could then be given in its second position 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.660
 by Gessle Winters Sorbas Alanko 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.660
 and she Vicario with the red lantern 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:29.279
 he knows jump Fulda headed Stenmark has everything under control everything 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.269
 To talk 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.159
 Helmert 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.679
 before Trichet leaves 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.549
 4 all like the Escher Green 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.659
 it was like this 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.089
 Alanco and there was one on the old I think Vicario now has that 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:46.549
 Participant field was stopped while forward Helmar Keane 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.209
 go in the big oak tree bow 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.090
 Kalbach with a clear advantage that it hits 50 meters Photo Thies all 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.200
 Gift table yield Sorbas and Alanco 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.580
 So now is the order in the big oaks book and we have to 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.709
 Helmar Cuba Sí Sí victory on the Rhine is already far ahead 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.169
 captures yes 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.180
 Heubach very soon with great advantage that I almost now 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.480
 a hundred meters 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.270
 Hey brand clearly ahead in second position we are for it some 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.109
 have that trackers meet the Mr. Rahn 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.759
 Allan Cole then still with the city of Vienna but bright Mark 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:29.999
 continue to be at the forefront of a clear advantage everyone likes to be second in 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.530
 the now Sorbas 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.799
 behind it you can see then I just go live Alanko 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.390
 that's how it works now 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.440
 Serve works delivered 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.670
 equal full wm-belt Göttinger or book him 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.680
 Denmark ahead all gave Alanko Sorbas Pretty Endless 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.299
 that the order 4 remained at the end of the field Geisha 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.180
 and at the front that steers further in bright market with big advantage 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.850
 on the entry to Helmand in front of all like in second position 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.199
 behind it you can see that the wet comes Sorbas Alan is a knight 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.589
 cheered up and now comes the same bright market in the enema final and 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:17.079
 Actually a poem can not do anything about what they actually do 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.939
 obstacle 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:23.210
 If the market is still in the way of about 300 meters are still back because of the 

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:28.979
 last jump both brands in these is clearly ahead of Mr. Markt ahead of a-league 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.770
 there was no reason his best all suspected 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.039
 try everything again but the lead is just huge 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.789
 But everybody likes to approach the market again threateningly 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.849
 but of course it can not endanger it worldwide 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.710
 Helmar ghost town goal winner 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.040
 Everyone likes to show a good match will be second Peter Orloff choir on the 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.770
 third place Saubers probably just barely fourth before criticism leaves and
