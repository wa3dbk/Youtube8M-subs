but<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.450> true<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.320> first<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> make

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
but it's true the first one here to make

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.530 
but it's true the first one here to make
full<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.880> losses<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:23.090> they<00:01:24.090> both<00:01:24.299> will

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
full kind of losses as a they both will

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.850 
full kind of losses as a they both will
be<00:01:24.659> able<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:24.960> exactly<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> full

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
be able to see exactly when the full

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.460 
be able to see exactly when the full
gets<00:01:26.130> made<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.420> couple<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> second

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
gets made and the couple of second

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.340 
gets made and the couple of second
difference<00:01:28.860> isn't<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> make<00:01:29.670> any<00:01:30.350> major

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
difference isn't going to make any major

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.370 
difference isn't going to make any major
difference<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.420> timing<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> any<00:01:34.229> third

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
difference in the timing of any third

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
difference in the timing of any third
tech<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.670> mean<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> reporting

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
tech but it will mean that the reporting

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
tech but it will mean that the reporting
can<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> couple<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:37.110> drones<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.619> before

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.580 
firing speed and this uh the choke is so
there's<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:43.970> many<00:03:44.060> artificial<00:03:44.900> choke<00:03:45.260> points

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
there's so many artificial choke points

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.199 
there's so many artificial choke points
in<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:45.799> map<00:03:45.980> they'd<00:03:46.489> be<00:03:46.549> able<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.820> use<00:03:47.090> the

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
in this map they'd be able to use the

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.479 
in this map they'd be able to use the
longer<00:03:47.570> range<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.110> hydras<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.799> think

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
longer range of the hydras I think

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.430 
longer range of the hydras I think
hydras<00:03:49.910> are<00:03:50.060> much<00:03:50.420> better<00:03:50.600> choice<00:03:50.900> here<00:03:51.260> and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
hydras are much better choice here and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.310 
hydras are much better choice here and
both<00:03:52.340> players<00:03:52.700> actually<00:03:53.180> only<00:03:53.690> LC<00:03:54.079> is<00:03:54.170> going

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
both players actually only LC is going

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.550 
both players actually only LC is going
to<00:03:54.380> lose<00:03:54.530> some<00:03:54.650> overlords<00:03:55.130> here<00:03:55.540> loosely

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
to lose some overlords here loosely

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.930 
to lose some overlords here loosely
because<00:03:57.560> all<00:03:57.769> these<00:03:58.010> pudding<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.400> Overlord<00:03:58.850> in

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
because all these pudding is Overlord in

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.110 
because all these pudding is Overlord in
the<00:03:59.000> corner<00:03:59.299> of<00:03:59.359> the<00:03:59.450> map

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
the corner of the map

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.160 
the corner of the map
just<00:04:00.450> erase<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:03.409> like<00:04:04.409> what<00:04:04.620> hottest

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
just erase it I like what hottest

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.260 
just erase it I like what hottest
knowing<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:06.950> seemed<00:04:07.250> see<00:04:07.849> if<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.030> could<00:04:08.150> get

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
knowing you seemed see if you could get

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.760 
knowing you seemed see if you could get
the<00:04:08.330> other<00:04:08.540> one<00:04:08.810> because<00:04:09.170> he<00:04:09.380> knew<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:09.650> is

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
the other one because he knew this is

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.839 
the other one because he knew this is
the<00:04:09.860> one<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.190> was<00:04:10.340> far<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.610> way<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:10.790> the

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
the one that was far the way in the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.820 
the one that was far the way in the
corner<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.120> going<00:04:11.270> to<00:04:11.330> die<00:04:11.420> anyway<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.739> it's

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
corner is going to die anyway so it's

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.960 
corner is going to die anyway so it's
like<00:04:12.950> I'll<00:04:13.099> see<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.340> I<00:04:13.400> can<00:04:13.520> cite<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.849> other

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
one first he wasn't able to do it but

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.340 
one first he wasn't able to do it but
