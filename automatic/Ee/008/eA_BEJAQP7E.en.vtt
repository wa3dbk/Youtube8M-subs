fancy<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.729> straightforward<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
fancy this is just straightforward and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.020 
fancy this is just straightforward and
simple<00:01:15.409> while<00:01:16.409> we're<00:01:16.530> doing<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.920> butter<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
simple while we're doing this butter and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.399 
simple while we're doing this butter and
and<00:01:19.880> lemon<00:01:20.880> pepper<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.840> I'll<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.080> take<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and lemon pepper so I'll just take the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.870 
and lemon pepper so I'll just take the
butter<00:01:22.729> put<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.000> inside<00:01:24.240> there

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
butter put it right inside there

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.340 
butter put it right inside there
can-can<00:01:26.880> spread<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> around<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.320> little

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
can-can spread it around just a little

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.950 
can-can spread it around just a little
bit<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.820> eventually<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> melt

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
bit but eventually that's going to melt

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
bit but eventually that's going to melt
in<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:34.310> I'll<00:01:35.310> make<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> mess<00:01:36.030> with
