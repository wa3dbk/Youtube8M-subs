tutorial series that I'll probably be

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.520 
tutorial series that I'll probably be
doing<00:00:19.830> will<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.460> contra<00:00:21.180> type<00:00:21.360> clone<00:00:21.690> so

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
doing will be a contra type clone so

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.560 
doing will be a contra type clone so
this<00:00:22.680> fits<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.100> nicely<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.120> I<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.360> show<00:00:24.480> you

just real quick I'm going to show you so
this<00:00:34.010> dark<00:00:35.010> outside<00:00:35.610> box<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.600> layout<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
this dark outside box is my layout so

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.950 
this dark outside box is my layout so
all<00:00:37.379> this<00:00:37.679> in<00:00:37.859> the<00:00:37.949> square<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.339> my<00:00:38.519> layout<00:00:38.960> okay

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
all this in the square is my layout okay

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
all this in the square is my layout okay
and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.620> dotted<00:00:40.920> line<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.609> my

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and then this dotted line here is my

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.759 
and then this dotted line here is my
window<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.839> is<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.109> the<00:00:43.199> player<00:00:43.409> sees

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
window so this is what the player sees

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.279 
window so this is what the player sees
and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.699> he<00:00:44.909> runs<00:00:45.179> it's<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.960> scroll

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and then as he runs it's going to scroll

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.560 
and then as he runs it's going to scroll
all<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.909> important<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.390> we're

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
all right that's important because we're

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
all right that's important because we're
going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.749> make<00:00:48.839> these<00:00:48.960> guys<00:00:49.370> spawn

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
going to make these guys spawn

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.529 
going to make these guys spawn
off-screen<00:00:51.530> but<00:00:52.530> still<00:00:52.769> in<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.069> layout<00:00:54.019> okay

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
off-screen but still in the layout okay

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.049 
off-screen but still in the layout okay
so<00:00:57.539> let's<00:00:57.719> turn<00:00:57.929> that<00:00:58.109> back<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.879> what<00:00:59.999> we

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
so let's turn that back on and what we

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.610 
so let's turn that back on and what we
want<00:01:00.269> we<00:01:00.479> want<00:01:00.510> him<00:01:00.929> to<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> bullet

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
want we want him to have the bullet

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.820 
want we want him to have the bullet
behavior<00:01:02.749> okay<00:01:03.749> and<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> destroy<00:01:04.379> outside<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
behavior okay and the destroy outside of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.680 
behavior okay and the destroy outside of
layout<00:01:05.040> behavior<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> way<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.479> he<00:01:06.540> gets

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
layout behavior so that way when he gets

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.270 
layout behavior so that way when he gets
to<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> NP<00:01:07.260> doesn't<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.800> keep<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.070> running

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to the NP doesn't just keep on running

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
to the NP doesn't just keep on running
all<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.240> we're<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.570> give<00:01:09.689> them<00:01:09.780> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
all right we're going to give them a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.649 
all right we're going to give them a
bullet<00:01:09.960> speed<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.350> 200<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.689> set<00:01:12.689> angle<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.110> no

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
bullet speed of 200 and set angle to no

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.700 
bullet speed of 200 and set angle to no
okay<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.020> we're<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.290> create<00:01:16.469> this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
okay and then we're going to create this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.889 
okay and then we're going to create this
sprite<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.280> called<00:01:17.579> spawn<00:01:17.939> point<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.810> what

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
sprite that I called spawn point so what

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:19.969 
sprite that I called spawn point so what
we're<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.409> we're<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> use

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
we're going to do is we're going to use

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.690 
we're going to do is we're going to use
this<00:01:20.719> as<00:01:21.719> our<00:01:22.320> marker<00:01:23.990> for<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.520> we<00:01:26.520> should

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
this as our marker for when we should

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
this as our marker for when we should
spawn<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:27.450> character<00:01:28.460> okay<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.399> going

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
spawn the character okay so we're going

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
spawn the character okay so we're going
to<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.799> we'll<00:01:34.799> stick<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.630> over

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to put one there we'll stick one over

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.789 
to put one there we'll stick one over
here<00:01:38.479> maybe<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.899> right<00:01:40.170> here

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
here maybe one right here

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.450 
here maybe one right here
and<00:01:42.409> then<00:01:43.409> any<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.130> rights<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:46.460> okay

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and then any one more rights here okay

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.149 
and then any one more rights here okay
now<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:49.109> we<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.679> we<00:01:49.799> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> see

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
now what we want to do is we want to see

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.060 
now what we want to do is we want to see
where<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.429> guy<00:01:50.609> looks<00:01:50.850> good<00:01:50.939> spawning<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.189> I

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
where this guy looks good spawning so I

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.630 
where this guy looks good spawning so I
say<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.250> maybe<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.270> maybe<00:01:57.450> 308

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
say right maybe right there so maybe 308

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.300 
say right maybe right there so maybe 308
maybe<00:01:59.640> 310<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> good<00:02:01.679> spot<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:01.950> him<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
maybe 310 is a good spot for him to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.310 
maybe 310 is a good spot for him to
spawn<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:06.979> maybe<00:02:07.979> 500<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.000> 310<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.660> 500<00:02:10.170> so

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
spawn or maybe 500 so 310 and 500 so

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.559 
spawn or maybe 500 so 310 and 500 so
let's<00:02:10.470> write<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.679> down

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
let's write that down

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.030 
let's write that down
310<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.370> 500<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.209> y

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
310 and 500 for the y

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.229 
310 and 500 for the y
okay<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.819> our<00:02:18.239> window<00:02:18.599> size<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.340> 640<00:02:20.340> by<00:02:20.459> 640

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239

on<00:02:54.810> layer<00:02:55.139> one<00:02:55.379> now<00:02:56.069> X<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.459> going<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:58.049> our

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
on layer one now X is going to be so our

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.460 
on layer one now X is going to be so our
our<00:02:58.709> player<00:02:59.280> is<00:03:00.049> currently<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.200> middle<00:03:01.409> of

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
our player is currently in the middle of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.379 
our player is currently in the middle of
the<00:03:01.560> screen<00:03:01.739> right<00:03:02.129> because<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.670> scroll<00:03:03.209> to

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
the screen right because it's scroll to

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.649 
the screen right because it's scroll to
behavior<00:03:04.250> our<00:03:05.250> window<00:03:05.549> width<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.790> 640<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:06.480> he's

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
behavior our window width is 640 so he's

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:16.009 
behavior our window width is 640 so he's
at<00:03:06.810> 320<00:03:07.409> so<00:03:08.220> let's<00:03:08.370> do<00:03:08.599> player<00:03:09.599> its<00:03:11.180> hero<00:03:13.129> x+<00:03:15.019> so

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
at 320 so let's do player its hero x+ so

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.030 
at 320 so let's do player its hero x+ so
another<00:03:16.349> 320<00:03:17.099> would<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.579> at<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.730> edge

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
another 320 would be right at the edge

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.939 
another 320 would be right at the edge
so<00:03:20.040> let's<00:03:20.340> say<00:03:22.310> 360<00:03:24.319> all<00:03:25.319> right<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:25.739> Y

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
so let's say 360 all right and then Y

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.680 
so let's say 360 all right and then Y
we're<00:03:26.129> going<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.340> use<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.639> choose<00:03:26.970> expression

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
we're going to use the choose expression

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.050 
we're going to use the choose expression
we're<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.739> choose<00:03:28.919> between<00:03:29.190> 310<00:03:29.879> and

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
we're going to choose between 310 and

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.300 
we're going to choose between 310 and
500<00:03:30.690> remember<00:03:31.620> we<00:03:31.680> picked<00:03:31.859> those<00:03:31.980> numbers

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
500 remember we picked those numbers

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.280 
500 remember we picked those numbers
moving<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.669> guy<00:03:32.819> around<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.720> it'll<00:03:33.900> he'll

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
moving the guy around so it'll he'll

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.869 
moving the guy around so it'll he'll
either<00:03:34.410> appear<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.889> top<00:03:35.069> platform<00:03:35.310> or<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
either appear on the top platform or the

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.259 
either appear on the top platform or the
bottom<00:03:36.150> platform<00:03:37.310> let<00:03:38.310> me<00:03:38.370> do<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.669> okay<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
bottom platform let me do that okay and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.720 
bottom platform let me do that okay and
then<00:03:39.389> we're<00:03:39.480> going<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.629> set<00:03:39.870> our<00:03:39.989> enemies

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
then we're going to set our enemies

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.610 
then we're going to set our enemies
animation<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.599> run<00:03:43.109> animation<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:45.620> we're

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
animation to the run animation and we're

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.710 
animation to the run animation and we're
going<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.799> set<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.099> enemies<00:03:47.579> bullet

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720

going to set the enemies bullet
angle<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.560> motion<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.400> 180<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.299> he<00:03:51.449> runs<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
angle of motion to 180 so he runs to the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.030 
angle of motion to 180 so he runs to the
left<00:03:53.090> okay<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:55.079> now<00:03:55.199> we've<00:03:55.410> run<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:56.870> boom

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
