graduate<00:01:31.639> and<00:01:32.210> come<00:01:32.450> up<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.899> that<00:01:33.829> also<00:01:34.460> keeps

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
hand cramps from happening and it makes

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.940 
hand cramps from happening and it makes

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
learned to do were to repair many of the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.960 
learned to do were to repair many of the
problems<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:24.890> caused<00:02:25.890> these<00:02:26.160> repairs<00:02:26.700> to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
problems that caused these repairs to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.200 
problems that caused these repairs to
come<00:02:27.150> about<00:02:27.420> our<00:02:27.750> design<00:02:28.620> problems<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:30.000> are

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
come about our design problems that are

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.570 
come about our design problems that are
built<00:02:30.450> into<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.930> guitars<00:02:31.340> some<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.460> those

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
built into the guitars some of those

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.220 
built into the guitars some of those
guitar<00:02:33.090> players<00:02:33.330> are<00:02:33.540> pretty<00:02:33.750> familiar<00:02:33.930> with

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
guitar players are pretty familiar with

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.380 
guitar players are pretty familiar with
one<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.280> them<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.660> neck<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.140> warp

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
one of them is that the neck can warp

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.180 
one of them is that the neck can warp
Gibson<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.540> early<00:02:39.840> 1920s<00:02:40.230> invented<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
Gibson in the early 1920s invented the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.970 
Gibson in the early 1920s invented the
adjustable<00:02:41.760> truss<00:02:42.120> rod<00:02:42.390> which<00:02:42.780> took<00:02:43.680> care<00:02:43.950> of

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
adjustable truss rod which took care of

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.180 
adjustable truss rod which took care of
that<00:02:44.160> problem<00:02:44.840> what<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:45.989> didn't<00:02:46.380> solve<00:02:46.620> was

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
that problem what they didn't solve was

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.970 
that problem what they didn't solve was
that<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.489> neck<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:48.090> still<00:02:48.330> pull<00:02:48.800> most<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that the neck can still pull most of the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.070 
that the neck can still pull most of the
traditional<00:02:50.130> guitars<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.630> we<00:02:51.870> know

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
traditional guitars that that we know

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.470 
traditional guitars that that we know
about<00:02:52.200> also<00:02:52.830> have<00:02:53.040> another<00:02:53.370> problem<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.180> that

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
about also have another problem and that

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.600 
about also have another problem and that
is<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.170> bridges<00:02:55.560> tend<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.890> tilt<00:02:56.100> forward

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
is the the bridges tend to tilt forward

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.890 
is the the bridges tend to tilt forward
with<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> string<00:02:57.180> tension<00:02:57.450> through<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
with the string tension through the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.600 
with the string tension through the
years<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.440> guitar<00:02:58.800> tends<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.280> belly<00:02:59.489> up

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
years and the guitar tends to belly up

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.320 
years and the guitar tends to belly up
and<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:01.709> wreak<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.130> causes<00:03:02.640> various

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
and that wreak that causes various

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.390 
and that wreak that causes various
repairs<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.410> happen<00:03:04.770> but<00:03:04.920> all<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.250> these

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
repairs to happen but all of these

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.070 
repairs to happen but all of these
things<00:03:05.670> affect<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.300> action<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:06.989> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
things affect the action and the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.199 
things affect the action and the
playability<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.920> guitar<00:03:08.250> make<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.970> tour

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
playability of the guitar make the tour

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.870 
playability of the guitar make the tour
hard<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.600> play<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.050> many<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.549> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
hard to play and many of the the the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.240 
hard to play and many of the the the
neck<00:03:12.090> warping<00:03:12.840> because<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.739> string<00:03:13.980> tension

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
neck warping because of string tension

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.430 
neck warping because of string tension
and<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.670> bridge<00:03:14.880> pulling<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.540> those<00:03:16.110> things

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and the bridge pulling up those things

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.830 
and the bridge pulling up those things
also<00:03:16.709> affect<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.640> tuning<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.180> guitar<00:03:18.540> and

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
also affect the tuning of the guitar and

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.240 
also affect the tuning of the guitar and
the<00:03:18.989> guitar<00:03:19.260> will<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:19.560> play<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:19.860> tune

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the guitar will not play in tune

this new guitar is not only to to

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.229 
this new guitar is not only to to
provide<00:03:47.380> big<00:03:47.980> new<00:03:48.220> sounds<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.940> we've<00:03:49.060> never

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
provide big new sounds that we've never

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.600 
provide big new sounds that we've never
had<00:03:49.390> before<00:03:49.569> but<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.319> solve<00:03:50.709> these<00:03:51.069> service

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
had before but to solve these service

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.199 
had before but to solve these service
problems<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.900> still<00:03:53.500> go<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:53.800> today<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
problems that still go on today the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.720 
problems that still go on today the
guitars<00:03:55.599> that<00:03:55.780> are<00:03:55.870> being<00:03:56.080> made<00:03:56.350> today<00:03:56.730> really

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
guitars that are being made today really

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.930 
guitars that are being made today really
the<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.000> bracing<00:03:58.930> patterns<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.940> the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
structure of the guitar really goes back

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.089 
structure of the guitar really goes back
to<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.450> 1850s<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:06.489> as<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.450> got<00:04:07.630> into<00:04:07.870> the

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
to the 1850s so the as we got into the

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.660 
to the 1850s so the as we got into the
1900s<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:09.630> Gibson<00:04:10.630> was<00:04:11.410> was<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.010> first<00:04:12.310> to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
1900s and Gibson was was the first to

1900s and Gibson was was the first to
start<00:04:13.000> Gibson<00:04:13.840> started<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.260> carve<00:04:14.620> guitars

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
start Gibson started to carve guitars

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.940 
start Gibson started to carve guitars
kind<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.640> like<00:04:15.819> violins<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.750> use<00:04:17.620> steel

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
kind of like violins and use steel

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.949 
kind of like violins and use steel
strings<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.609> more<00:04:18.940> like<00:04:19.150> mandolins<00:04:19.780> had

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
strings on a more like mandolins had

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.810 
strings on a more like mandolins had
been<00:04:20.169> using<00:04:20.530> later<00:04:21.070> on<00:04:21.810> martin<00:04:22.810> had<00:04:23.250> x<00:04:24.250> bracing

been using later on martin had x bracing

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.840 
been using later on martin had x bracing
in<00:04:25.000> their<00:04:25.180> guitars<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:26.310> they<00:04:27.310> had<00:04:27.460> small

in their guitars and they had small

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.240 
in their guitars and they had small
guitars<00:04:28.240> at<00:04:28.479> that<00:04:28.600> time<00:04:28.870> they<00:04:29.290> adapted<00:04:30.100> the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
guitars at that time they adapted the

the surface of the water and it brought

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.490 
the surface of the water and it brought
