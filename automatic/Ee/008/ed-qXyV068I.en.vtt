00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
doesn't fix the problem because the real

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.620 
doesn't fix the problem because the real
problems<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> swing<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.569> know

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
problems in the swing and that you know

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.270

what<00:02:50.780> we're<00:02:50.930> able<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.319> as<00:02:51.470> coaches<00:02:51.680> as<00:02:52.130> it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
what we're able to do as coaches as it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.430 
what we're able to do as coaches as it
is<00:02:52.489> help<00:02:53.000> identify<00:02:53.750> where<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.110> problem

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
is help identify where the problem

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.830 
is help identify where the problem
really<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.830> get<00:02:55.340> them<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.670> work<00:02:55.819> on<00:02:55.970> them<00:02:56.239> then

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
really is get them to work on them then

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.559 
really is get them to work on them then
all<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.140> sudden<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.500> symptoms<00:02:57.890> go<00:02:58.040> away

it's them and that's why they're not

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.809 
it's them and that's why they're not
going<00:04:42.349> better<00:04:42.710> they're<00:04:43.009> having<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.310> mental<00:04:43.639> X

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
going better they're having a mental X

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.490 
going better they're having a mental X
or<00:04:44.000> something<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:44.389> really<00:04:44.419> just<00:04:44.810> does<00:04:45.169> affect
