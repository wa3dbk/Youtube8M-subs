00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.720
 friends of guitars and welcome beyond 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.070
 fitness between simone gianlorenzi this 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.750
 month I was inspired by the interview 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.240
 I play a mass to start a new one 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.869
 lecture cycle then dedicates pennata 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.640
 alternating 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.800
 we will leave this month from the benetta 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.309
 alternating applied tonic vent 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.350
 less a technique so dear to 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.410
 guitarists like a mass game but 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.239
 also johnson rather than zakk wylde 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.370
 principals and therefore the training that you 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.410
 I will propose is based on a series of 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.420
 exercises on the first pentatonic box 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.760
 of minor finds an exercise and the other 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.140
 I left some space for yours 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.690
 running so that at least 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.940
 virtually this month we can play 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.680
 together and our lesson becomes more 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.230
 interactive that I never give you an appointment 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.470
 next month good work from simone 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.470
 Gianlorenzi 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.539
