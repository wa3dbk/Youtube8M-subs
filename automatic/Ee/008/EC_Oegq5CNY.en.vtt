00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello, comrades, how are you waiting? 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.270
 you are hellishly because today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 I bring another crazy new episode 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.309
 patrols in 5 minutes and this time 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.099
 I bring an episode for hard line to see 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.910
 if you guess the thing is about the gas and the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.490
 smoke 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.109
 the gas patrol the ingredients 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 for this patrol are the following 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 we need two specialists who 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 they have to carry gas grenades the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.429
 gas mask the ammunition box and the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.869
 weapon with a look and rnv of an increase and 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.700
 silencers we will need two more 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.920
 specialists with smoke grenades the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.219
 ammunition box the gas mask and the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.800
 weapon with other sights and increase rnv 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.629
 and silencers on remaining members of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.700
 the patrol can be chosen as 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 want an operator or another specialist 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.510
 to complete the formula there is no 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 to forget about the advantages of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.469
 reputation both couples of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.870
 specialists should select 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.090
 quick launch to launch the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.879
 grenades faster ammo boxes 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.940
 Improved targeted fast and contention 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.489
 elevated the mission of this patrol is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.380
 be highly effective in the area 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 target although it is alone 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.270
 There was not sanctioned to become all 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 how effective we could wish and the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.330
 it gave nothing, you take home, it takes time to recharge 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.240
 an eternity 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.759
 both combined grenades create the gas 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 of death if the enemy did not wear 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.409
 gas mask be fix yara and if the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.810
 have not noticed anything because of the smoke and 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.049
 we will have an advantage with the thermal sights 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.670
 it's simple we put the rules if 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.560
 an enemy wants to go through that area 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 I'm going to have to put on a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.299
 configuration very similar to ours 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.119
 which seems very unlikely because in 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.119
 this game people go a lot to their ball 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.390
 the sight and rnv of a 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.100
 increase by the fact of being a look 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.990
 thermal with which we have a better 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420
 vision through smoke or even 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.399
 inside him this kind of crazy patrol 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.620
 is designed for modes with zones 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.990
 hot as mode heist mode 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.100
 bloody money or even mode 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.100
 rescue 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 the gaseous patrol the strong points 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.540
 of this patrol are we create a small 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.140
 area in which it is rinsed with our 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.480
 rules 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.340
 the enemy wears a gas mask what 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.560
 I also feel like going to need one 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.810
 look technique the enemy takes a look 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.000
 thermal you will also need a 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.030
 gas mask the enemy has to 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.510
 carry both the smoke camouflages the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.280
 gas 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.290
 Many times the gas is not effective 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.080
 because it is seen with the naked eye and the enemy 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.000
 avoid that area does not happen the same with the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.769
 smoke as it is apparently much less 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 dangerous that the gas the players do not 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.910
 often hesitate to cross it or not and there 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.160
 comes the funny thing when the enemy 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.130
 discover that inside the smoke there is also 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.240
 gas gas comrades the patrol 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.730
 soda 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.550
 but take care of your weak points and 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.620
 bear in mind are serious problems of 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.420
 supply of pomegranates especially 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.400
 with gas powered that although they last 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.350
 a lot of it took us to recharge the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.510
 eternity we have to think very well 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.430
 where we want to start gassing before 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.590
 do it or also the specialists of 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.410
 gas can take turns in the launch 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.120
 small or closed spaces our 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.710
 specialty it goes without saying that 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.390
 this patrol is not worth much in 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.150
 open spaces or in game modes 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.310
 where there are no hot areas 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.350
 consolidated or if good comrades this 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.390
 has been the video today I hope that you 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.430
 I liked you leave your like if it gives you the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.470
 win for another crazy chapter 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.260
 patrols in 5 minutes to see if we can 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.210
 get to 700 likes it would be good to 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.160
 let's get there and if you made one you have the 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.850
 video so you could share it with a 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.500
 friend 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.850
