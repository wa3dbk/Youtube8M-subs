00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.480
嘿 YouTube users are just airing the first episode of Charlie and the Three Musketeers. It basically 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.660
 Need a place that has been used by Formos in the past few weeks on Sunday night. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.810
 So, you can think of playing with Peter Capaldi, no matter what the role of Sherlock Holmes, 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.599
 The doctor who is the fan will like it and it looks like a lot of fun. 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.000
 So I will do this season is a weekly review of each episode. There are 10 totals. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.610
 Be sure to subscribe to everything you get. I also asked a big question at the end of this month. 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.309
 About the future Musketeers and other things, another new show, I want to do this video 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.100
 At the end of this video, it will be awesome if you answer this question. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.620
 This film will be the first episode with a review of some background information 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.090
 Actor and Peter Capaldi, as he may not come back to Series 2. For the American people, 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.579
 These events will be the destructors of the BBC America in the air so carefully in April or May. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.780
 So let's do our first 5 moments from the premiere and then I will do my review. 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.030
 No. 5 - Red wedding cross. This is a one dollar moment, but the queen is very 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.359
 Alexandra Dowling who played Roslin Frey in the red wedding episode 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.789
 throne. All I can think of is that this is not going to end well. I know her character in Canon. 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.880
 It's completely safe, but if David Bradley has ever been a guest, everyone is starting to worry. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.850
 In the show her husband Ryan Gage is the king, but he also from the desolate alfrid 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.320
 Smaug. Both characters are royal douchebags. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.780
 No. 4 - De Madonna in winter. She participated in the premiere small just because they had to 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 Introduced everything, but she played Maidie McCoy from Wolland. Cardinal, after 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.670
 Musketeer she has the biggest features in the show. If you haven't seen Canon yet 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 Then I will not destroy her background story. But the plot explains why she wants 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.939
 Atos frame. 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.509
 Think she is the cross between Catherine Lannister and Melisandre. 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.689
 No. 3 - Change from Canon. Most of the musketeers movies that have been made 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.020
 Changed something, but this version deviated very early. Characters in Rochefort 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.350
 Got to go, people. Who was killed at the end of the plot. He is not in credit, 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.430
 So maybe they will introduce him after the series. Because he is like a colonel 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.259
 Moran is at the Canon's big and big Moriarty. 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.259
 They did include dartanion want to fight all three Musketeers once though. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.829
 My famous mantra is everyone, all is one, will it be part of the series? 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.900
 Until later in the season though. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 As we have seen now, the Musketeer. Doubles will slowly become a unit. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.510
 Number 2 - Paris 1630. I am talking about the world of the series. I am a huge fan 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.410
 During the adventure and they went to the road that made the environment very long 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.440
 Authentic. Most of my attention goes to a more depressed place like a pub. 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.970
 Dartangan meets Mrs. Dewinter and Mendoza. 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.630
 When the service lady licks the bowl of internal organs in front of him, all I can think of is 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.750
 The tragic world of the Danadian shop. Just like everyone lives in extreme poverty. Interestingly 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.910
 enough. The last event of the error is happening for almost 200 years. 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.560
 This series. 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.220
 My number 1 moment - No. 1 doctor is always. You don't have to 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.010
 The doctor who fan enjoys Peter Capaldi playing the villain. But it makes so much fun 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.370
 Use a doctor who looks at him as a context. I think people like tumblr have a real 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.160
 Responsibility makes this mashup happen. Call me who is the Master Cardiologist. 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.199
 For anyone's curiosity, CAPARDI was converted to a doctor before the Three Musketeers finished shooting 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.470
 Who, so any reference to his conversation is just a coincidence. But this won't stop 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.040
 We have some fun. 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.260
 In the show Capaldi said that his work is really hard not to make his cardinal tradition 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.229
 Little man. Just like the episode he said. Everything he does is in the best interest of France. 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:38.389
 You can see that it is his plan that won't let France get swallowed up in Spain. 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.979
 I haven't seen a lot of other works of Capaldi's torch wood and hours outside, so 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.199
 I am most excited to try to infer the cardinality for this is still a doctor 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.720
 About 8 or 9 months. 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.720
 As a side note, they have already finished Series 1, but the manufacturer says that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.660
 They expect Capaldi’s doctor to be a series who promises not to let him back 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.560
 2. But he always came back to the guest appearance. 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.650
 Let me know that your favorite moment is from the premiere. Your loyal fans 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.590
 Canon's, which are the last three swordsman versions you saw? 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.410
 In general, I really like it. All the Musketeers are great. Luke Pasqualino is a very good protagonist. 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.750
 And Maidie McCoy will be a lot of fun. If you are a fan of the Fullmetal Alchemist brothers. 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.669
 She is a good simulation of desire. One of Canon, they have really become a big aspect 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.850
 Up is "the shipping aspect. It is very obvious that D'Artagnan and Bowen sewed 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.520
 The hard drive will be shipped and De Winter and Athos. 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.790
 It won't be the throne level of the game sexposition, but I have seen a lot of comparisons 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.430
 The story structure in the exhibition. 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.210
 The Musketeers' plot will be taken alone. Therefore, the plot of each week 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.010
 Will solve it by itself. This week, the main story is to discredit Atos. game of Thrones 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.850
 On the other hand is highly serialized. The plot was carried out from an episode to 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.460
 next. 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.880
 I will say that I am a bit worried, just because the high degree of serialization often tends to be more 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.650
 in the end. That kind of deflation knows that it will be explained every week. 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.490
 It won't leave a lot of room to look forward to. But I am still very excited to rest 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.190
 Series. 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.580
 There will be a ton of celebrity guest stars. Jason Fleming will be blown 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.530
 The Louvre next week, Pooh Jones will play one of the guards of Peter Capaldi. 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.370
 Interlude in the future. 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.490
 I will post a video review Sunday from now on. Be sure to subscribe to everything you get. 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.470
 Eventually, this will become the Musketeer and the Walking Dead on my channel Sunday. sword 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.810
 And the zombie wins. 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.810
 Because I won't be a Q&amp;A video Musketeer, if you have any problems. 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.570
 The plot or just the series just left their opinions, I will try my best 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.510
 Answer everything there. 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.710
 Also, as a side note, I am thinking about making a black sail for the video. So please let 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.210
 I know the opinion, if this thing you will be interested 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.210
 Now, please click here to give me Sherlock his last vow to review and click here to give me spoilery 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.850
 The throne trailer game crashes. There are some spoilers, so be careful. 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.460
 Thanks for watching and seeing you tonight. High-five!
