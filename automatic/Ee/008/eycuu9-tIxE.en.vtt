okay yeah so your answer will come yes
so<00:02:36.090> we're<00:02:36.270> doing<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.840> each<00:02:37.050> cone<00:02:37.380> but<00:02:37.710> then

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
so we're doing one on each cone but then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.740 
so we're doing one on each cone but then
just<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.220> there's<00:02:38.400> no<00:02:38.460> all<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:38.940> cone<00:02:39.420> cells

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
just so there's no all that cone cells

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.000 
just so there's no all that cone cells
different<00:02:40.140> we're<00:02:40.230> swapping<00:02:40.410> over<00:02:40.650> half<00:02:40.860> way

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
different we're swapping over half way
