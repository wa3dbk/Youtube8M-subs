but just to demonstrate this for you
today<00:00:38.989> okay<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:40.770> easy<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
today okay so it's really easy to do so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970 
today okay so it's really easy to do so
you've<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.450> little<00:00:42.690> con<00:00:42.989> Taylor<00:00:43.260> there<00:00:43.680> if

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you've got a little con Taylor there if

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
you've got a little con Taylor there if
tap<00:00:44.340> water<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> choose<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
tap water and then you choose up to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
tap water and then you choose up to
three<00:00:47.039> colors<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.670> guess<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.300> more<00:00:48.570> but

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
three colors I guess you can do more but

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
three colors I guess you can do more but
I<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.440> looks<00:00:49.620> nicer<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> with

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
I just think it looks nicer and with

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.459 
I just think it looks nicer and with
less<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.500> ways<00:00:57.260> let's<00:00:58.260> go

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
less so I'm going to go ways let's go

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.740 
less so I'm going to go ways let's go
with<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:58.800> nude<00:00:59.100> colors<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:05.750> with

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

going to use the two for now so you get
your<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:16.280> blog<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> be

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
your first blog and you want it to be

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.800 
your first blog and you want it to be
quite<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> big<00:01:18.509> blob

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.429 

the<00:01:27.350> quite<00:01:27.649> sick<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.100> these<00:01:28.189> nail<00:01:28.430> polishes<00:01:29.439> so

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
the quite sick of these nail polishes so

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:39.279 
the quite sick of these nail polishes so
that's<00:01:30.619> created<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.100> thin<00:01:31.340> lie<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:37.479> then<00:01:38.479> get<00:01:38.930> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
that's created a thin lie I then get the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.950 
that's created a thin lie I then get the
second<00:01:39.680> color<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:43.369> put<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.330> in<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> center

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
second color and put that in the center

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.230 
second color and put that in the center
of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.170> other<00:01:45.289> one<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:46.490> you'll<00:01:46.939> see<00:01:47.149> it

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
of the other one and you'll see it

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.460 
of the other one and you'll see it
expanding<00:01:47.840> out<00:01:47.990> like<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.320> just

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
expanding out like so and you just

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.880 
expanding out like so and you just
continue<00:01:51.679> from<00:01:52.130> there<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.960> think<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.679> get

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
continue from there and I think you get

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.510 
continue from there and I think you get
a<00:01:55.009> more<00:01:55.310> detailed<00:01:55.340> affect<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.689> more<00:01:57.520> blobs

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
a more detailed affect the more blobs

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.169 
a more detailed affect the more blobs
you<00:01:58.729> do<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:01.220> if<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.429> was<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.580> leave<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.030> at<00:02:02.149> that

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
you do so if I was to leave it at that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.480 
you do so if I was to leave it at that
and<00:02:02.630> I'll<00:02:03.319> just<00:02:03.530> an<00:02:03.770> example<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.190> when<00:02:04.369> I've

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
and I'll just an example of when I've

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.760 
and I'll just an example of when I've
done<00:02:04.610> before<00:02:05.030> you'd<00:02:05.630> probably<00:02:05.899> get<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.500> sort

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
done before you'd probably get this sort

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.279 
done before you'd probably get this sort
of<00:02:06.860> effect<00:02:07.090> but<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.239> more<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.479> do<00:02:08.810> you'll<00:02:09.080> get

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
of effect but the more you do you'll get

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.900 
of effect but the more you do you'll get
the<00:02:09.649> finer<00:02:09.890> details<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.519> just<00:02:13.670> bear

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
the finer details so if you just bear

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.030 
the finer details so if you just bear
with<00:02:13.940> me<00:02:14.090> while<00:02:14.299> I<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.599> few<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.019> these<00:02:16.569> em

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
with me while I do a few of these em

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.150 
with me while I do a few of these em
every<00:02:19.299> everyone's<00:02:20.299> different<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:21.980> one

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
every everyone's different like this one

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.680 
every everyone's different like this one
you<00:02:22.190> can<00:02:22.280> see<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.730> only<00:02:22.880> taken<00:02:23.299> up<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.510> certain

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
you can see is only taken up a certain

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.259 
you can see is only taken up a certain
area<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.319> container<00:02:24.769> some<00:02:25.190> take<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.730> over

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
area of the container some take it over

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.320 
area of the container some take it over
it<00:02:26.360> all<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:28.459> obviously<00:02:28.819> that's<00:02:29.030> enough

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
it all and but obviously that's enough

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.170 
it all and but obviously that's enough
to<00:02:29.480> dip<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.810> nailing<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:30.769> that's<00:02:30.980> fine<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.090> you

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
to dip you nailing so that's fine so you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.849 
to dip you nailing so that's fine so you
can<00:02:32.329> see<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.660> Rings<00:02:32.870> are<00:02:33.049> getting<00:02:33.290> finer<00:02:33.590> now

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
can see the Rings are getting finer now

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.410 
can see the Rings are getting finer now
as<00:02:34.100> we<00:02:34.730> start<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.060> build<00:02:35.299> up<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.540> layers<00:02:37.420> you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
as we start to build up the layers you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
as we start to build up the layers you
can<00:02:38.450> add<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.930> other<00:02:39.079> colors<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.680> could<00:02:39.890> say<00:02:40.040> I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
can add in other colors I could say I

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.440 
can add in other colors I could say I
just<00:02:40.579> think<00:02:40.730> sometimes<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.359> looks<00:02:41.480> nicer<00:02:43.450> with

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
just think sometimes it looks nicer with

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:58.600 
just think sometimes it looks nicer with
a<00:02:44.510> couple<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:50.150> waiting<00:02:50.390> for<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.780> expand

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.110 

and<00:02:59.530> then<00:03:00.530> I'm<00:03:00.650> going<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.950> use<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> final<00:03:01.850> color

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
and then I'm going to use a final color

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080 
and then I'm going to use a final color
in<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.690> middle<00:03:02.990> champagne<00:03:03.800> which<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.820> just<00:03:05.000> a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
in the middle champagne which is just a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.810 
in the middle champagne which is just a
bit<00:03:05.240> of<00:03:05.330> glitter<00:03:09.160> just<00:03:10.160> had<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> little<00:03:10.550> bit<00:03:10.790> of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
bit of glitter just had a little bit of

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.940 
bit of glitter just had a little bit of
difference<00:03:11.060> there<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.500> now<00:03:12.890> you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
difference there so then you now you

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.820 
difference there so then you now you
create<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:13.970> pattern<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.630> it's<00:03:15.320> really<00:03:15.500> easy<00:03:15.620> to

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
create a pattern and it's really easy to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.670 
create a pattern and it's really easy to
do<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.100> can<00:03:16.400> do<00:03:16.550> whichever<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.420> want<00:03:17.600> em<00:03:17.900> so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
do you can do whichever you want em so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.290 
do you can do whichever you want em so
you<00:03:18.770> just<00:03:18.890> use<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.130> little<00:03:19.190> cuticle<00:03:19.880> stick<00:03:20.000> or

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
you just use a little cuticle stick or

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.130 
you just use a little cuticle stick or
something<00:03:20.450> like<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:22.870> start<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.990> create

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
something like that and start to create

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.310 
something like that and start to create
a<00:03:24.320> pattern<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.630> go<00:03:26.780> from<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
a pattern and and you go from the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.140 
a pattern and and you go from the
wellhead<00:03:28.160> doesn't<00:03:28.640> matter<00:03:28.760> with<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.000> give

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
wellhead doesn't matter with you give

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.420 
wellhead doesn't matter with you give
from<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.420> inside<00:03:29.750> out<00:03:29.780> or<00:03:30.200> what<00:03:30.830> but<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.130> tend

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
from the inside out or what but I tend

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:43.280 
from the inside out or what but I tend
to<00:03:31.610> go<00:03:31.730> from<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.030> outside<00:03:32.360> in

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.199 

so<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.920> can<00:03:44.129> create<00:03:44.400> any<00:03:44.610> sort<00:03:44.909> of<00:03:45.000> pattern

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
so you can create any sort of pattern

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:53.119 
so you can create any sort of pattern
you<00:03:45.510> like<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:51.599> can<00:03:51.810> create<00:03:52.109> like<00:03:52.349> simple<00:03:52.859> web

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
you like you can create like simple web

00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:03.220 
you like you can create like simple web
effect<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.109> easy<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.409> do

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
effect like this it's really easy to do

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.149 
effect like this it's really easy to do
hopefully<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.319> can<00:04:04.470> see<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:04.799> effect<00:04:07.159> so

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
hopefully you can see this effect so

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.349 
hopefully you can see this effect so
that's<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.489> look<00:04:08.609> i'm<00:04:08.760> going<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:08.970> go<00:04:09.090> far

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
inside out if you want to do it the

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.830 
inside out if you want to do it the
other<00:04:15.659> way<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.590> end<00:04:16.739> up<00:04:16.889> with<00:04:17.070> more<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.430> a

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
straight away like that and then I'm

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.149 
straight away like that and then I'm
going<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.409> twirl<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.789> stick<00:04:54.060> around<00:04:54.949> to<00:04:55.949> pick

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
going to twirl this stick around to pick

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:03.890 
going to twirl this stick around to pick
up<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.699> excess<00:04:57.090> and<00:05:00.650> there<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:01.770> have<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.900> that

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
up the excess and there you have it that

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.510 
up the excess and there you have it that
simple<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.590> you'll<00:05:04.800> find<00:05:05.099> because<00:05:05.340> it's

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
simple and you'll find because it's

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.450 
simple and you'll find because it's
mixed<00:05:05.909> with<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.090> water<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.889> it<00:05:07.889> just<00:05:08.159> dries

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
mixed with the water and it just dries

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.089
