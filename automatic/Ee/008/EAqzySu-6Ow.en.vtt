00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
don't want it to spread out all over the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.700 
don't want it to spread out all over the
place<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.170> that's<00:01:48.619> why<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.549> did<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:50.360> way

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
place and that's why I did it that way

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.960

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
so then we're going to come in with a

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
so then we're going to come in with a
little<00:01:53.240> bit<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.420> yellow<00:01:53.600> polish<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.259> we're

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
little bit of yellow polish and we're

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.710 
little bit of yellow polish and we're
just<00:01:54.710> going<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.009> add<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.189> very<00:01:55.490> tiny<00:01:55.789> dot<00:01:56.119> now

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
because the Polish in the bowl or in the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.949 
because the Polish in the bowl or in the
cup<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.979> not<00:02:00.979> as<00:02:01.159> fluid<00:02:01.580> as<00:02:01.759> it<00:02:01.819> was<00:02:02.090> before<00:02:02.270> the

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
cup is not as fluid as it was before the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.749 
cup is not as fluid as it was before the
yellow<00:02:03.259> dot<00:02:03.470> shouldn't<00:02:03.860> spread<00:02:04.130> out<00:02:04.310> too<00:02:04.580> much
