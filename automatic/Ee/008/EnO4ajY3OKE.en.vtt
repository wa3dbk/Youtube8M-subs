00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.500
 friends of the channel from 8 e 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.719
 cookers 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.210
 today I'll show you how to replant the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.449
 onions from scraps or onions 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.430
 sprout then we take a knife 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:30.740
 and cut off part of the onion 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.740
 this is where the root is 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.290
 this game 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.449
 this 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.019
 we use it for cooking if it is 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.350
 let's put aside this part here must 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:56.369
 dry for two or three hours 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:01:01.340
 out and then we can transplant it into 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:05.720
 in this case it will be enough to place it here on top 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.370
 and puts 23 centimeters of earth touches now 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.550
 I don't do it because it should dry 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.170
 a little off after you put the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.490
 earth above 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:21.729
 keep wet at three in three weeks 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.729
 I'll show you how different 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.710
 we are in March and here is how i appear 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.820
 our sprouted onion scraps 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.050
 after three weeks 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.200
 here I had buried 3 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.580
 now we're going to bury them for 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.470
 then divide them before we invite the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.310
 land if we can not down the region 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.310
 for the dc 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.310
 and then 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.050
 let's see how they appear 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.050
 our onion waste 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.630
 1 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.620
 beretta 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.430
 here another 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.070
 these two others will be divided these 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.290
 are two different seedlings that can 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.890
 give rise to onions and the other is 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.890
 This 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.079
 these are also two different plants 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.019
 as we do from people while different 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:38.569
 when they have two of these whites it is 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:43.090
 having said that this tends to be different 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.090
 instead here only one was born 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.310
 then in case they are plants 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:56.549
 different we take a knife and without 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.549
 fear we share here 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.970
 so 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.439
 here are our onion sprouts 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:12.189
 taken from the shots 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:15.129
 now we can transplant them where pcv 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.049
 uncomfortable deep reservoirs at least 30 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.640
 centimeters 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.069
 between them must have at least 15 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.069
 inches between the rows 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.940
 then we can also plant them in the earth 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.050
 if you have land available 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.590
 another thing we can do e 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.570
 reuse sprouted onions if 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.610
 the big onions we can recover the 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.050
 external part for use in the kitchen 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.170
 and the inside of the love between plants 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.480
 this is like the other little plant 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.210
 directly so internal of course with 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.860
 your own dc evening below so we have 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.940
 seen how we can reuse the 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.940
 sprouted onions 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.760
 sprouted chip shots 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.070
