00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
hey there we're we're just testing eye

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.080 
hey there we're we're just testing eye
affinity<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:11.040> far<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.370> good<00:00:11.400> I'm<00:00:11.820> here

most<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> part<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.400> there<00:00:23.550> was

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
most the part of that I know there was

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.519 
most the part of that I know there was
that<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> short<00:00:24.359> title<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> most

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that was a short title what was the most

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
that was a short title what was the most
among<00:00:26.029> James<00:00:27.029> obviously<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.930> man<00:00:28.080> behind

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
among James obviously the the man behind

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
among James obviously the the man behind
this<00:00:28.619> engine<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.099> he's<00:00:29.250> actually<00:00:29.550> getting<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
this engine and he's actually getting I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.250 
this engine and he's actually getting I
affinity<00:00:30.390> working<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.080> we're<00:00:31.230> just

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
affinity working on it so we're just

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
affinity working on it so we're just
here<00:00:31.500> fooling<00:00:31.830> around<00:00:32.040> I'm<00:00:32.669> looking<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.000> what

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
here fooling around I'm looking at what

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.350 
here fooling around I'm looking at what
really<00:00:33.210> struck<00:00:33.780> us<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.530> incredibly<00:00:35.399> fast

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
really struck us is how incredibly fast

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.490 
really struck us is how incredibly fast
this<00:00:36.780> card<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.649> 5870<00:00:42.500> yeah

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
this card is so this is the 5870 yeah

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.930 
this card is so this is the 5870 yeah
you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.920> interesting<00:00:44.430> because<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you know it's interesting because you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
you know it's interesting because you
know<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.300> every<00:00:45.539> year<00:00:45.570> new<00:00:45.870> newer<00:00:46.230> cards

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
know I know every year new newer cards

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.930 
know I know every year new newer cards
come<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.039> faster<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.460> faster<00:00:47.579> while

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
come out they go faster and faster while

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.840 
come out they go faster and faster while
this<00:00:48.149> card<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.200> looked<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.460> fun<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
this card I looked up just for fun is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
this card I looked up just for fun is
over<00:00:51.570> four<00:00:51.989> trillion<00:00:52.350> single-precision

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
over four trillion single-precision

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.389 
over four trillion single-precision
floating-point<00:00:54.440> operations<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.829> over<00:00:56.160> four

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
floating-point operations for over four

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
floating-point operations for over four
teraflops<00:00:57.090> yeah<00:00:57.539> actually<00:00:57.809> we're<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> real

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
teraflops yeah actually we're in a real

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
teraflops yeah actually we're in a real
game<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> AI<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.309> already<00:00:59.789> gonna<00:00:59.940> kick<00:01:00.180> our

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
game so the AI is already gonna kick our

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.459 
game so the AI is already gonna kick our
butts<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.899> hurry<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.230> let's<00:01:01.379> go

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
butts if we don't hurry up so let's go

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.510 
butts if we don't hurry up so let's go
ahead<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.620> throw<00:01:01.859> let's<00:01:02.190> throw<00:01:02.309> outdoor

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
ahead and throw let's throw outdoor

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.820 
ahead and throw let's throw outdoor
tests<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.390> throw<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.690> some<00:01:03.719> King<00:01:04.439> crypt<00:01:04.650> wars

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
tests and throw in some King crypt wars

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530 
tests and throw in some King crypt wars
sure<00:01:05.339> yeah

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
sure yeah

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
sure yeah
yeah<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.070> stress

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
yeah because think of what stress

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.810 
yeah because think of what stress
testing<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> um<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> use

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
testing is is that um you want to use

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
testing is is that um you want to use
your<00:01:12.000> big<00:01:12.240> complicated<00:01:12.840> units<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.530> they

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
your big complicated units because they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
your big complicated units because they
put<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> most<00:01:14.220> stress<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> system<00:01:15.150> they

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
put the most stress on the system they

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
put the most stress on the system they
have<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> most<00:01:15.570> geometry<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.650> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
have the most geometry and so on and so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.899 
have the most geometry and so on and so
forth<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.070> we've<00:01:17.189> got<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> King<00:01:17.549> crypt<00:01:17.759> door

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
forth so we've got the King crypt door

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.380 
forth so we've got the King crypt door
he's<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> big<00:01:19.340> unit<00:01:20.340> he's<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> our<00:01:21.210> major

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
he's a big unit he's one of our major

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
he's a big unit he's one of our major
experimentals<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.380> Supreme<00:01:22.680> Commander<00:01:23.040> too

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
experimentals and Supreme Commander too

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.820 
experimentals and Supreme Commander too
so<00:01:23.670> let's<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.150> put<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.780> let's<00:01:25.590> put<00:01:25.710> in

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so let's go and put in like let's put in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
so let's go and put in like let's put in
like<00:01:25.950> twenty<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.460> thirty<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> things<00:01:27.240> just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
like twenty or thirty of the things just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
like twenty or thirty of the things just
to<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.930> push<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> system<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.130> that's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to really push the system and that's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.310 
to really push the system and that's
pretty<00:01:30.060> good<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.240> that's<00:01:30.270> eighteen<00:01:30.869> King

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
pretty good so that's eighteen King

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.760 
pretty good so that's eighteen King
crypt<00:01:31.680> doors<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.780> fun<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
crypt doors so just for fun because I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.499 
crypt doors so just for fun because I
know<00:01:34.829> where<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
know where we're really what we want to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
know where we're really what we want to
see<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> break<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> game<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.680> let's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
see if we can break the game and let's

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.530 
see if we can break the game and let's
go<00:01:38.280> ahead<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.700> grab<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.060> those<00:01:39.119> King<00:01:39.329> crypt

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
go ahead and grab all those King crypt

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.810 
go ahead and grab all those King crypt
doors<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.960> double<00:01:40.650> click<00:01:40.829> online<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.430> then

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
doors like double click online and then

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.810 
doors like double click online and then
copy<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.299> paste<00:01:42.540> down<00:01:43.140> another<00:01:43.740> five<00:01:44.189> ten

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
copy and paste down another five ten

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.149 
copy and paste down another five ten
groups<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.509> okay<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.829> that's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
groups of them okay so that's that's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.370 
groups of them okay so that's that's
awesome<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:47.939> let's<00:01:48.899> take<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> look<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.259> our

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
awesome so now let's take a look at our

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.780 
awesome so now let's take a look at our
frame<00:01:49.619> rate<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.950> forgot<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> bring<00:01:50.430> our<00:01:50.579> frame

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

over four trillion floating point
calculations<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.320> thought<00:02:59.500> it'd<00:02:59.590> be

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
calculations I thought it'd be

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.180 
calculations I thought it'd be
interesting<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:00.130> check<00:03:00.370> minds<00:03:00.610> in<00:03:00.760> an<00:03:00.820> ad<00:03:00.970> book

when I was 14 years old I went to
RadioShack<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.440> bought<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.739> book<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.250> I

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
RadioShack and I bought this book and I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.819 
RadioShack and I bought this book and I
double<00:03:07.900> check<00:03:08.050> there<00:03:08.260> was<00:03:08.350> no<00:03:08.440> multiply

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
double check there was no multiply

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.280 
double check there was no multiply
instruction<00:03:09.100> back<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.670> 1980<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.360> we<00:03:10.989> did<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> lot

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
instruction back in 1980 so we did a lot

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.780 
instruction back in 1980 so we did a lot
of<00:03:11.350> adding<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.769> know<00:03:11.799> many<00:03:12.010> additions<00:03:12.640> it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
of adding you know many additions it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.610 
of adding you know many additions it
would<00:03:12.940> take<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.269> render<00:03:13.450> 500<00:03:14.079> King<00:03:14.200> crypt<00:03:14.440> ours

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
would take to render 500 King crypt ours

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.810 
would take to render 500 King crypt ours
that'd<00:03:15.370> be<00:03:15.489> like<00:03:15.810> 100<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:18.010> Jillian's<00:03:18.549> ill
