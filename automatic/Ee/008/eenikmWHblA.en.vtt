00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.530 

so<00:00:01.079> before<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.680> get<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.520> step<00:00:02.820> I'm

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
so before you get to this step I'm

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.539 
so before you get to this step I'm
working<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.080> Reverse<00:00:04.259> here<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.920> just<00:00:04.950> decided

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
working in Reverse here I just decided

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.480 
working in Reverse here I just decided
to<00:00:05.730> start<00:00:05.910> recording<00:00:06.180> midway<00:00:06.660> through<00:00:07.049> it

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
to start recording midway through it

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.740 
to start recording midway through it
before<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.670> get<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.179> step<00:00:09.450> where<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
before you get to this step where the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.820 
before you get to this step where the
dash<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.920> exposed<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:12.030> need<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.389> remove<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.380> I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
dash is exposed you need to remove the I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.240 
dash is exposed you need to remove the I
guess<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.429> pizzelle<00:00:14.880> or<00:00:16.010> whatever<00:00:17.010> else

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
guess the pizzelle or whatever else

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.689 
guess the pizzelle or whatever else
covers<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:17.970> that's<00:00:18.420> gonna<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:20.430> thing

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
covers it and that's gonna be this thing

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.960 
covers it and that's gonna be this thing
right<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:22.369> sure<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.550> looks<00:00:23.789> familiar

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
right here so sure this looks familiar

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.609 
right here so sure this looks familiar
if<00:00:24.449> you're<00:00:24.600> driving<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.080> manual<00:00:25.470> transmission

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
if you're driving a manual transmission

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.589 
if you're driving a manual transmission
car<00:00:26.189> you're<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.460> gonna<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.029> obviously

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
car you're not gonna have this obviously

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
car you're not gonna have this obviously
this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.039> trim<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> plastic<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
this is just a trim of plastic that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.490 
this is just a trim of plastic that
surrounds<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> gauge<00:00:31.560> cluster<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:33.260> there<00:00:34.260> are

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
surrounds the gauge cluster so there are

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.680 
surrounds the gauge cluster so there are
five<00:00:35.040> screws<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.850> need<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.090> undo<00:00:36.360> here

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
five screws that you need to undo here

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
five screws that you need to undo here
one<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.450> here<00:00:39.890> there<00:00:42.260> one<00:00:43.260> there<00:00:43.850> one

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
until this is plugged back in just

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.709 
until this is plugged back in just
remember<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.969> also<00:01:59.969> when<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.210> finally<00:02:00.570> do

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
drive it with it not fully mounted it's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.109 
drive it with it not fully mounted it's
not<00:02:04.860> gonna<00:02:05.040> record<00:02:05.430> miles<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> odometer

those four it just takes a little bit of
like<00:02:34.860> elbow<00:02:35.370> grease<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.849> get<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.120> cluster<00:02:36.959> out

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
like elbow grease to get the cluster out

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.770 
like elbow grease to get the cluster out
and<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.220> can<00:02:38.459> begin<00:02:38.640> swapping<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.599> light

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and you can begin swapping out the light

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.360 
and you can begin swapping out the light
bulbs<00:02:40.110> or<00:02:40.230> fixing<00:02:40.590> out<00:02:40.680> whatever<00:02:41.010> else<00:02:41.190> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
needs you need to fix on the cluster

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.110 
needs you need to fix on the cluster
here<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.049> back<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.530> cluster<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.970> I

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
here is the back of the cluster like I

let's<00:04:19.530> say<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:19.979> dropped<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.700> light<00:04:21.630> bulb

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
let's say that you dropped a light bulb

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.420 
let's say that you dropped a light bulb
from<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.169> cluster<00:04:22.680> behind

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
from the cluster behind

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.700 
from the cluster behind
the<00:04:24.580> footwell<00:04:25.270> or<00:04:25.840> above<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.380> flow<00:04:26.530> well

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
the footwell or above the flow well

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.620 
the footwell or above the flow well
rather<00:04:26.970> into<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.060> -<00:04:28.270> while<00:04:28.509> you<00:04:28.600> were

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
rather into the - while you were

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.650 
rather into the - while you were
changing<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.199> lightbulb<00:04:29.410> it's<00:04:30.419> kind<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.570> an

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
changing the lightbulb it's kind of an

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.390 
changing the lightbulb it's kind of an
easy<00:04:31.810> fix<00:04:32.229> if<00:04:32.530> you're<00:04:32.710> lucky<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.370> can

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
easy fix if you're lucky you can

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.670 
easy fix if you're lucky you can
actually<00:04:33.729> open<00:04:34.030> up<00:04:34.539> one<00:04:34.870> of<00:04:34.990> these<00:04:35.110> panels<00:04:35.410> and

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
look through these holes here and see if

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.860 
look through these holes here and see if
you<00:04:38.979> can<00:04:40.229> see<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.350> light<00:04:41.560> from<00:04:42.009> within<00:04:42.340> the

if not you can remove there's four
Phillips<00:04:49.300> screws<00:04:50.220> under<00:04:51.220> here<00:04:52.680> two<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.830> them

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
Phillips screws under here two of them

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.689 
Phillips screws under here two of them
are<00:04:54.280> actually<00:04:54.970> one<00:04:55.330> is<00:04:55.479> there<00:04:56.250> one<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.400> there
