that as of right now this is probably my

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.570 
that as of right now this is probably my
favorite<00:00:12.750> controller<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.559> game<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
favorite controller to game with at the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.810 
favorite controller to game with at the
moment<00:00:14.900> yes<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> Xbox<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.340> coming

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
moment yes I know the Xbox one is coming

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.230 
moment yes I know the Xbox one is coming
out<00:00:18.000> ps4<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> steam<00:00:19.830> controller<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.880> but

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
out ps4 and the steam controller so but

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
out ps4 and the steam controller so but
it<00:00:21.330> will<00:00:21.420> probably<00:00:21.630> change<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
it will probably change them for the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
it will probably change them for the
time<00:00:22.680> being<00:00:23.010> let<00:00:23.220> me<00:00:23.460> tell<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.760> why<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.119> bought

this thing and why I think personally

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660 
this thing and why I think personally
it's<00:00:28.349> probably<00:00:28.800> my<00:00:28.949> favorite<00:00:29.220> controller<00:00:29.490> at

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
it's probably my favorite controller at

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.370 
it's probably my favorite controller at
the<00:00:29.730> moment<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> things<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.349> I

the moment now one of the things that I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.290 
the moment now one of the things that I
know<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.710> really<00:00:32.040> clever<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> original

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

Wii Remote is that when you turned it
sideways<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> bucket<00:00:36.750> alignment<00:00:37.410> match

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sideways at the bucket alignment match

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
sideways at the bucket alignment match
that<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.640> an<00:00:38.730> original<00:00:39.180> NES<00:00:39.480> controller<00:00:39.899> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that of an original NES controller this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
that of an original NES controller this
made<00:00:40.320> virtual<00:00:40.649> console<00:00:40.950> games<00:00:41.070> feel<00:00:41.430> very

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
made virtual console games feel very

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
made virtual console games feel very
good<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.000> very<00:00:42.149> natural<00:00:42.899> because<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.320> had<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
good and very natural because it had the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.380 
good and very natural because it had the
same<00:00:43.860> short<00:00:44.129> alignment<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.000> controller

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
same short alignment this controller

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.240 
same short alignment this controller
does<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> same<00:00:45.960> sort<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> thing<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.070> look

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
does the same sort of thing if you look

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.330 
does the same sort of thing if you look
right<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:48.059> d-pad<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.899> ATX<00:00:49.289> why<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:50.100> the

and it feels a lot more responsive to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.839 
and it feels a lot more responsive to
that<00:02:12.080> way<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:13.130> sort<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.459> personal

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
that way it's sort of a personal

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.790 
that way it's sort of a personal
preference<00:02:14.150> thing<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.019> really<00:02:15.530> really

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
preference thing but I really really

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.640 
preference thing but I really really
like<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.280> over<00:02:16.790> traditional<00:02:17.300> trigger<00:02:17.930> Mel

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
like that over traditional trigger Mel

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.900 
like that over traditional trigger Mel
the<00:02:18.769> great<00:02:19.010> thing<00:02:19.190> about<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.400> controller<00:02:19.819> is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the great thing about this controller is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.890 
the great thing about this controller is
it<00:02:20.540> has<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.959> shape<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:22.100> an<00:02:22.310> Xbox<00:02:22.670> controller

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
it has the shape of an Xbox controller

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.190 
it has the shape of an Xbox controller
but<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.680> also<00:02:25.010> has<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.610> USB<00:02:25.970> port<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.510> top<00:02:26.750> or

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
but it also has the USB port on top or

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.170 
but it also has the USB port on top or
charging<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:27.830> many<00:02:28.040> USB<00:02:28.370> power<00:02:28.730> source<00:02:28.970> can

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
charging so many USB power source can

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.910 
charging so many USB power source can
charge<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.569> although<00:02:30.049> you<00:02:30.110> need<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.709> charge

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
charge it although you need to charge

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.559 
charge it although you need to charge
off<00:02:31.100> because<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.819> battery<00:02:31.850> life<00:02:32.540> is

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
off because the battery life is

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.309 
off because the battery life is
absolutely<00:02:33.380> insane<00:02:33.819> eight<00:02:34.840> hours<00:02:35.840> battery

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
absolutely insane eight hours battery

absolutely insane eight hours battery
life<00:02:36.530> connecting<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.760> really<00:02:37.970> don't<00:02:38.150> need

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
life connecting so you really don't need

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.140 
life connecting so you really don't need
to<00:02:38.390> charge<00:02:38.690> any<00:02:38.930> time<00:02:39.170> soon<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.700> issue<00:02:40.940> i

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
to charge any time soon the issue i

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.390 
to charge any time soon the issue i
really<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.989> this<00:02:42.260> controller<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.250> what

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
really have this controller is that what

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.520 
really have this controller is that what
you<00:02:43.489> plug<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.360> doesn't<00:02:44.959> switch<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.500> a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
you plug it in it doesn't switch to a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.220 
you plug it in it doesn't switch to a
wired<00:02:45.890> type<00:02:46.400> mode<00:02:46.730> like<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.180> ps3<00:02:47.780> controller

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
wired type mode like the ps3 controller

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.620 
wired type mode like the ps3 controller
does<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.340> essentially<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.209> charger

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
does and it's essentially just a charger

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.580 
does and it's essentially just a charger
and<00:02:50.750> while<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.019> still<00:02:51.170> uses<00:02:51.410> wireless

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
and while it's still uses wireless

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.380 
and while it's still uses wireless
