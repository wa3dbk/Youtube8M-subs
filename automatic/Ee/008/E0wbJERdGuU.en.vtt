got my main power running down to the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.240 
got my main power running down to the
starter<00:02:20.750> there<00:02:21.020> see<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.710> lug<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.100> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
starter there see the lug on the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.800 
starter there see the lug on the
starters<00:02:22.730> actually<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> little<00:02:23.360> loose<00:02:23.540> I'm

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
starters actually a little loose I'm

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.900 
starters actually a little loose I'm
gonna<00:02:23.960> have<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.200> take<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.310> apart<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.790> get

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
gonna have to take that apart and get

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.060 
gonna have to take that apart and get
that<00:02:26.060> fixed<00:02:27.880> got<00:02:28.880> my<00:02:29.540> kill<00:02:29.810> wire<00:02:30.050> right<00:02:31.010> there

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
that fixed got my kill wire right there

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.210 
that fixed got my kill wire right there
connects<00:02:31.850> on<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> side<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.540> motor<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.220> I

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
connects on the side of the motor and I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.950 
connects on the side of the motor and I
just<00:02:34.580> got<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.940> hanging<00:02:35.330> right<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:35.900> I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
just got that hanging right here so I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.830 
just got that hanging right here so I
can<00:02:36.020> ground<00:02:36.440> out<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.950> Magneto<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.000> kill

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
can ground out the Magneto and and kill

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.480 
can ground out the Magneto and and kill
this<00:02:39.020> bugger<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.680> if<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.130> gets<00:02:40.250> out<00:02:40.460> of

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
this bugger and if it gets out of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.850 
this bugger and if it gets out of
control<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.150> don't<00:02:41.990> have<00:02:42.140> any<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.560> throttle

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
control I don't have any of the throttle

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.140 
control I don't have any of the throttle
cables<00:02:43.430> or<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.420> choke<00:02:44.840> cable<00:02:45.170> hooked<00:02:45.320> up<00:02:45.470> yet

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
cables or the choke cable hooked up yet

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.850 
cables or the choke cable hooked up yet
and<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.930> governor<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.350> still<00:02:48.440> hooked<00:02:48.650> in

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
and the governor is still hooked in

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.560 
and the governor is still hooked in
motor<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:49.340> you'll<00:02:49.520> notice<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.970> runs<00:02:50.210> kind<00:02:50.480> of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
motor so you'll notice this runs kind of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.740 
motor so you'll notice this runs kind of
kind<00:02:51.350> of<00:02:51.410> high<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:52.760> there<00:02:53.000> that's<00:02:53.180> that's

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
kind of high right there that's that's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.750 
kind of high right there that's that's
actually<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> little<00:02:54.800> home-built<00:02:55.190> muffler<00:02:55.700> I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
actually a little home-built muffler I

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.000 
actually a little home-built muffler I
threw<00:02:56.120> together<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.690> few<00:02:57.080> years<00:02:57.140> ago<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.710> just

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
threw together a few years ago it just

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.560 
threw together a few years ago it just
was<00:02:58.370> kind<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.700> messing<00:02:59.000> around<00:02:59.090> with<00:02:59.330> some

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
was kind of messing around with some

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.440 
was kind of messing around with some
muffler<00:02:59.900> designs<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:01.430> pretty<00:03:01.730> loud<00:03:01.940> it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
muffler designs and it's pretty loud it

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.270 
muffler designs and it's pretty loud it
really<00:03:02.810> doesn't<00:03:03.200> quiet<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.860> much<00:03:04.960> so

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
really doesn't quiet it all that much so

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.220 
really doesn't quiet it all that much so
all<00:03:07.280> right

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
all right

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.550 
all right
let's<00:03:09.230> let's<00:03:10.010> see<00:03:10.220> about<00:03:11.230> firing<00:03:12.230> this

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
let's let's see about firing this

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.670 
let's let's see about firing this
critter<00:03:12.860> up<00:03:13.100> here<00:03:13.400> we'll<00:03:13.970> take<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:15.380> wire

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
critter up here we'll take this wire

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.390 
critter up here we'll take this wire
here<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.750> little<00:03:18.470> alligator<00:03:18.800> clip<00:03:19.220> on

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
here with this little alligator clip on

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.790 
here with this little alligator clip on
here<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.240> I<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:20.660> should<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:21.620> feel<00:03:21.740> a

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
here and I just should just feel a

00:03:21.800 --> 00:04:03.110 
here and I just should just feel a
tapper<00:03:22.250> on<00:03:22.370> here

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.360 

well<00:04:04.120> there<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.480> is

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
well there it is

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.890 
well there it is
I'm<00:04:06.370> pretty<00:04:06.640> happy<00:04:06.879> it<00:04:07.180> doesn't<00:04:07.510> seem<00:04:07.659> to<00:04:07.780> move

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
I'm pretty happy it doesn't seem to move

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.750 
I'm pretty happy it doesn't seem to move
around<00:04:08.079> too<00:04:08.439> much<00:04:08.470> doesn't<00:04:09.010> transfer<00:04:09.549> a<00:04:09.579> lot

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
around too much doesn't transfer a lot

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.470 
around too much doesn't transfer a lot
of<00:04:09.909> vibration<00:04:10.030> into<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.840> body<00:04:11.590> at<00:04:11.799> all<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
of vibration into the body at all the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.720 
of vibration into the body at all the
rubber<00:04:13.480> mounts<00:04:13.930> seem<00:04:14.079> to<00:04:14.230> be<00:04:14.319> doing<00:04:14.560> their<00:04:14.680> job

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
rubber mounts seem to be doing their job

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.810 
rubber mounts seem to be doing their job
as<00:04:15.730> you<00:04:15.849> can<00:04:16.030> see<00:04:16.239> down<00:04:16.419> there<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.780> had<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.820> little

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
as you can see down there I had a little

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.729 
as you can see down there I had a little
spot<00:04:19.030> where<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.359> was<00:04:19.419> rubbing<00:04:19.900> there's<00:04:20.500> almost

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
spot where it was rubbing there's almost

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.550 
spot where it was rubbing there's almost
the<00:04:20.979> identical<00:04:21.039> spot<00:04:21.780> on<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.020> other<00:04:23.169> side

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
the identical spot on the other side

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.659 
the identical spot on the other side
here<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:25.600> not<00:04:25.750> quite<00:04:26.020> as<00:04:26.139> bad<00:04:26.350> no<00:04:27.220> it's

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
here it's not quite as bad no it's

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.000 
here it's not quite as bad no it's
pretty<00:04:27.789> hard<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.060> see<00:04:28.470> well<00:04:29.470> what<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.740> did<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.220> I

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
pretty hard to see well what I did is I

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.920 
pretty hard to see well what I did is I
took<00:04:33.010> some<00:04:33.580> sandpaper

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
took some sandpaper

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.080 
took some sandpaper
and<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.710> had<00:04:35.860> some<00:04:36.039> spray<00:04:36.340> adhesive<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:36.970> I

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
and I had some spray adhesive and I

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.290 
and I had some spray adhesive and I
sprayed<00:04:37.360> it<00:04:37.479> on<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.690> sandpaper<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.530> just

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
sprayed it on the sandpaper and I just

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.640 
sprayed it on the sandpaper and I just
put<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.419> on<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.660> side<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.139> wall<00:04:41.320> right

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
put it on the side of the wall right

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.390 
put it on the side of the wall right
here<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:43.050> also<00:04:44.050> on<00:04:44.380> on<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.889> side<00:04:45.100> over<00:04:45.280> here

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
here and also on on this side over here

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.040 
here and also on on this side over here
and<00:04:46.500> just<00:04:47.500> shave<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:48.280> done<00:04:48.970> off<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.780> tips

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
and just shave just done off of the tips

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.350 
and just shave just done off of the tips
to<00:04:50.949> where<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:52.620> shouldn't<00:04:53.620> have<00:04:53.860> too<00:04:54.550> much<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.270> a

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
to where I shouldn't have too much of a

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.520 
to where I shouldn't have too much of a
problem<00:04:55.630> with<00:04:56.199> strikes<00:04:56.710> I'd<00:04:57.280> say<00:04:57.610> oh<00:04:58.260> I<00:04:59.260> don't

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
problem with strikes I'd say oh I don't

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.110 
problem with strikes I'd say oh I don't
know<00:04:59.770> there's<00:05:00.039> maybe<00:05:00.280> an<00:05:00.460> eighth<00:05:00.639> of<00:05:00.850> an<00:05:00.970> inch

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
know there's maybe an eighth of an inch

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.089 
know there's maybe an eighth of an inch
there<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:04.660> does<00:05:04.870> open<00:05:05.229> up<00:05:05.349> a<00:05:05.500> little<00:05:05.800> bit<00:05:06.010> in

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
there it does open up a little bit in

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.950 
there it does open up a little bit in
the<00:05:06.190> back<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:07.180> duct<00:05:07.389> there's<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.720> little

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
the back the duct there's a little

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.270 
the back the duct there's a little
oblong<00:05:08.440> I'd<00:05:09.160> say<00:05:10.500> it's<00:05:11.500> kind<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.740> hard<00:05:11.919> to<00:05:11.979> see

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
oblong I'd say it's kind of hard to see

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:20.820 
oblong I'd say it's kind of hard to see
but<00:05:13.229> it's<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.380> little<00:05:14.530> deceiving<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:20.620> about<00:05:20.770> a

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
but it's a little deceiving it's about a

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.500 
but it's a little deceiving it's about a
quarter<00:05:21.220> inch<00:05:21.250> in<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.669> back<00:05:21.699> at<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:22.270> very

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
quarter inch in the back at that very

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.270 
quarter inch in the back at that very
back<00:05:22.780> point<00:05:23.050> there

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
back point there

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.640 
back point there
that's<00:05:24.849> the<00:05:25.030> worst<00:05:25.270> spot<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.930> can<00:05:26.199> live<00:05:26.500> with

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
that's the worst spot I can live with

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.270 
that's the worst spot I can live with
that<00:05:26.860> it's<00:05:27.639> not<00:05:27.820> going<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.030> be<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.180> big<00:05:28.479> deal<00:05:29.280> so

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
that it's not going to be a big deal so

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.000 
that it's not going to be a big deal so
my<00:05:30.460> next<00:05:30.520> project<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.530> there<00:05:32.530> I've<00:05:32.680> got<00:05:32.860> my
