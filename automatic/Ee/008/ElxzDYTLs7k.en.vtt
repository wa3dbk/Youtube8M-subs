potential<00:01:18.990> fans<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.189> part<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.490> what

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549

outside<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> underground<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.450> he

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
outside of the underground is that he

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380 
outside of the underground is that he
writes<00:01:24.900> his<00:01:25.200> songs<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.390> low-key

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
Chris's songs have plenty of hooks I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.460 
Chris's songs have plenty of hooks I

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
out there who made that sort of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.179 
out there who made that sort of
songwriting<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.110> they're<00:01:37.439> great<00:01:37.829> doing

I<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.560> Chris<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.159> eccentric<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I just think Chris is so eccentric that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.600 
I just think Chris is so eccentric that
he<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> potential<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.560> make<00:01:43.860> songs<00:01:44.189> that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
he has the potential to make songs that

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.210 
he has the potential to make songs that
