00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.750
 the cdh occupied the contractor 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.409
 dissatisfied with their work yeah 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.350
 honestly Yes 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.299
 in time 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.290
 we mean the gas n years now 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.730
 that tinkering a little 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.800
 I guess we would not have changed 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.800
 but no no no 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.070
 he 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.159
 a year ago or illicit and to change 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.350
 these machines one is 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.380
 I am told 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.759
 john deere the water yes that disturbing will 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.189
 regularly and agrees to you 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.460
 a cinoche in front of all profane works 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.020
 yeah that's that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.440
 I was extending you this office has 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440
 rowed voice 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.290
 he even had competition that 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.720
 finally arrived at the wheel at the drop of 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.800
 corbiÃ¨res doubling his park and then that 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.190
 continues to rotate 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.190
 Okay 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.119
 so he is flexible if you ask him 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.689
 silage with a gauge of 24 for 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.689
 to be discussed 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.220
 and parents 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.450
 thank you leuze 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.550
 yeah 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.260
 at the end of the construction, we get up because 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.450
 than 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 I am to ignore as sow 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.760
 yes it was he who was single it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.560
 he who puts tractors 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.930
 so that's a work overload 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.380
 in less and then probably a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.150
 constraint 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.200
 - good situation that's great visit 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.870
 it's not because we can not in 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 together 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.200
 m 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.520
 but it is necessary resales that it is a 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.520
 little 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.439
 obliged to be like that what 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.920
 so the sister state they are 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.480
 that they are well its benefits we come 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.390
 to have good your sister is always 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.569
 Priority 1 which made it a yes 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.110
 it's a good time would be my first 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.680
 tunes that are claimed by its inventors 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.950
 so here he says work the 49 55 I'm 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.600
 raise or so yes it's been a long time for 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.520
 connoisseurs 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.819
 at first it was a failure 1.40 manages it 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.170
 in lime with chargers on 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.750
 ticket problem so there he 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.720
 works from the g lab on their flight 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.910
 in front of pay no it works well on 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.830
 wii 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.780
 by front loaders oh yes I 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.720
 take a contract because he has become accustomed 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.550
 with 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.830
 Besides, it counts alone 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.290
 beyond the stability to laugh 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.640
 chargers if you have efforts 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.980
 in the other that imbalance of 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.180
 tractors what is a real job 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.230
 work with him on others 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.230
 yards are beet 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.069
 as possibly nationalist 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.340
 defect of pressing even a danger me 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.340
 Hamelle 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.550
 Simon 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.510
 the age tape for 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.600
 case could also lower and this 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.630
 avoid cigarette butts I have one 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.720

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.040
 go 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.230
 after 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.410
 the more we advance in full line more 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.140
 maybe a little bit 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.140
 I am not messi 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.660
 do not expect too much 3 those who 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.039
 believe in the first traders 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.039
 mechanics and 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.710
 we like it all the same there for 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.770
 pay is respected because for the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.030
 silo preparations then to have the 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.380
 staff and towers 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.650

 I try but not too much 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.230
 but a shot of iron against 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.969
 I used 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.240

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.240
 1950 also 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.880
 and after I on a good account the 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.289
 machinery 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.470
 what else are there islanders 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.440
 this team four teams 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.750
 that others I am obliged 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.020
 m 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.900
 nine hundred and fifty years 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.259
 he pulling the ships in 1960 and 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.259
 powerful 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.460
 so for you there 960 these two machines 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.390
 who works well 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.560
 going in the air 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.670
 your vision of rice farmers who is 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.880
 aubin 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:49.510
 the 961 okay but provided that 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:52.470
 bind two heaps serving time there the 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.470
 big he is well exploded 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.150
 it's a lot 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.150
 ecological of always yes 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.530
 I sought you find such 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.070
 seeking one who is not affected in 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.540
 all points of agreement 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.689
 but you had complete grains just 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.360
 meeting so many years 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:14.979
 so everything is exploded away but she 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.959
 could then visited open in two but 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.539
 big ones who do not have any causes of 

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.759
 death is therefore supposed to be a part of 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:23.529
 setting above are slaughtered all 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.509
 way of departure and I could have tried 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.939
 to examine a little bit that comes back in 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.639
 selection 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:32.499
 good very frankly that was ok I 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.049
 could not manage to find 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:36.819
 half grains and they ask if 

00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:38.889
 to know gilles savoie the redemption I like 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.689
 have been adapted to what I wanted but 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.110
 I had against the creators locates 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:44.820
 can squeeze a little 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.610
 on shots and made 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.560
 problem even though I asked for 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.910
 tighten a little 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.400
 I was even surprised I thought he 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.199
 did that with family or 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.199
 he promised he will go to criticism 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.740
 was not bothered with signs 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.320
 thaler all sexes esteem john deere he 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.060
 was regularly

 they will long avoid cdma in whom 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.659
 just as they had elsewhere 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.659
 the time 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.740
 flying the entrepreneur trade 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.220

 because he 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.220
 well installed the bo questions 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.700
 collected 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.700
 mr now 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.410
