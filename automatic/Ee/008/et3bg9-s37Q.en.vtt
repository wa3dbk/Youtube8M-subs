00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello, my name is Alina and today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.150
 I want to share with you how I went 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 to the intercharm show tell what 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.679
 I saw a new interesting for myself and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.210
 show your purchases at all intercharm 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.460
 this exhibition is the number one door 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.440
 beauty industry and at the moment she 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.100
 is the largest in all of Russia and 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.020
 cis 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.939
 she passes crocus expo and takes 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.220
 area of ​​almost 22 thousand square 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.900
 meters and so you understand its scale 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 if you were ever crocus expo 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 she is unusually large she takes not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.250
 one pavilion and as many as 4 4 huge 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.770
 pavilion which is simply unrealistic 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 get around in one day and see all 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.480
 products that participants offer but 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.550
 I think the most interesting thing is that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 really deserved my attention i 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.020
 saw for myself is actually very 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 A big plus is that all products are on display. 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.399
 at lower prices they are valid 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.410
 discounts of ten to thirty percent and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.449
 it is very profitable and some 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 producers also give carrion some 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 miniaturki probnichki 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.059
 it's naturally very nice on 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.620
 the exhibition comes from the seller from different 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.409
 countries so you can find for yourself 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.570
 something fundamentally new and interesting 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.570
 actually why did I go there 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.670
 The first thing I bought is a skin tonic 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.040
 head cypress extract from the company 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
 pampas lately i have been very strong 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 sweated on japanese and korean cosmetics 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 it seems to me that they put the right 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
 ingredients composition what their products 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.790
 really works and works better 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.259
 than other product at all I think that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.450
 I will soon have a separate 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.140
 box with favorites where will 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.790
 written from japan will apply tonic 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 is in such a beautiful package 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.380
 which also can not but rejoice the dark 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.450
 bottles into it a handy pump for 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 spraying I even had it once 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.070
 try it seemed to me a very effect 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.079
 interesting it is a little burning but 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.850
 It passes fast enough for now 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.040
 I really liked this tool and I hope 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.750
 I would like it to continue if 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.130
 she will be really cool then I 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.090
 I will tell you about him 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.040
 in more detail 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870
 Also at the exhibition were representatives 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.030
 companies or 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.880
 and no one I bought myself shampoo and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.410
 Air conditioning in a series of frangipani and I still 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.630
 did not have time to use these 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.760
 but I heard a lot about them 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 good these two means absolutely 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.650
 natural they do not contain sulfates 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 parabens and preservatives also they are not 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.060
 contains water thanks to what their for a long time 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.090
 enough I bought one from them 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.120
 product for the body is a natural gel 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.340
 for the body with the effect of losing weight 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.740
 ends my cream from the head I wanted 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.390
 decided to buy something to replace 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.100
 try such a remedy she also 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.130
 completely organic here is 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.080
 extracts of black pepper cucumber 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.400
 lemongrass aloe vera green tea 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.530
 In general, all all useful components 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.660
 which can be collected here 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.910
 that's why I drew attention to 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.950
 This gel and I hope that he will have 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.110
 as cool as his 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.670
 The composition also I bought a base for 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.760
 Mike in fact I have enough of them 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.250
 a lot but honestly I just could not 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.620
 do not buy this product because the effect 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.540
 As they say on the face when I am a girl 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.320
 put it on hand cream soaked 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.270
 instantly leaving behind such 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.920
 silky matte finish really 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.959
 skin levels very well 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.940
 she's so nice that topic 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.010
 fingers she wore products 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.290
 then I wanted to sit myself and smooth 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.510
 I am 1000 times convinced that really 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.030
 Products made in Japan possesses very 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.770
 good qualities and for now 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.900
 for me this is the best base in maikop 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.420
 which I tried on product 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.610
 which is one hundred percent everyone has already seen it 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.860
 dry shampoo alpha test this gave me 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.209
 as a gift when buying this tool so 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.160
 Now I do not know whether it is worth more 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.200
 dwell on these products because 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.630
 what seems to me to be just lazy and them 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.090
 not told it dry shampoos which 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.680
 helps to refresh your hair and postpone 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.110
 that day when you have to wash your hair 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.570
 a horse that for a while but put in order 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.700
 hair with this shampoo 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.800
 I bought for the first time but I tried a lot 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.570
 other dry shampoos and think that after 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.370
 its use I can make a conclusion 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.489
 really he is so good or not 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.560
 white and vitaminchiki from Kiwi firms 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.390
 si is also a japanese brand 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.610
 I heard a lot of good things about them 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.090
 vitamins and supplements so I decided 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.920
 try specifically 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.040
 these vitamins contain algae 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.350
 and I bought and for detoxification of the body 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.180
 to fill the gap in 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.590
 trace elements and vitamins and want 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.560
 try as far as these vitamins 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.750
 different from the usual ones i 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.910
 I used to take it of course I think that everything 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.620
 know that algae is Clarice 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.020
 biologically useful substances for 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.880
 but I think not everyone knows 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.889
 that of course and quality content 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.050
 these substances in algae 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.210
 resembles the composition of human blood as 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.060
 helps more correctly and 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.520
 balance the body 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.560
 human microelements and vitamins in 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.380
 overall so my choice fell on 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.020
 these vitamins I wanted to try them and 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.389
 if they have some super 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.400
 they do not have a gorgeous effect 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.590
 ordinary vitamins I about it to you 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.360
 I will definitely tell you the next product 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.310
 about which I want to tell me it seems 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.900
 very interesting it is such a treat 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.820
 filter bit which 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.130

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.139
 nozzles on the shower hose and she created 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.740

 filtering stages but i bought the most 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.289
 latest model 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.870
 this is due to these balls 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.479
 inside these balls help clear the water 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.729

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.010
