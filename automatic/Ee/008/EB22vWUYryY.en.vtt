00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
not necessarily a bad thing like if

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.889 
not necessarily a bad thing like if
you're<00:01:12.520> going<00:01:12.700> with<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:12.850> habit<00:01:13.450> if<00:01:13.750> you're

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
you're going with that habit if you're

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.149 
you're going with that habit if you're
going<00:01:14.049> on<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.229> mountain<00:01:14.560> road<00:01:14.710> you're<00:01:14.950> goin

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
down the mountain is it better just

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.110 
down the mountain is it better just
trying<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.110> get<00:01:17.229> in<00:01:17.350> neutral

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
trying to get in neutral

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.550 
trying to get in neutral
now<00:01:19.750> if<00:01:19.900> you're<00:01:19.990> going<00:01:20.140> downhill<00:01:20.290> you

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
now if you're going downhill you

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.780 
now if you're going downhill you
actually<00:01:20.830> want<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.040> engine<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.400> be<00:01:21.490> breaking

actually want the engine to be breaking
a<00:01:21.850> bit<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.150> it's<00:01:22.270> just<00:01:22.360> better<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.690> shift<00:01:23.050> down

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
a bit so it's just better to shift down

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.900 
a bit so it's just better to shift down
let<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.470> engine<00:01:23.710> engine<00:01:24.130> brake<00:01:24.400> and<00:01:24.730> your

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
let the engine engine brake and your

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.800 
let the engine engine brake and your

so you know and you're already breaking
with<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.570> rear<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.860> engine<00:01:57.190> braking

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
with the rear so the engine braking

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.460 
with the rear so the engine braking
might<00:01:57.670> account<00:01:57.940> for<00:01:58.120> like<00:01:58.360> point<00:01:58.690> zero<00:01:59.350> two

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
might account for like point zero two

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.460 
might account for like point zero two
five<00:02:00.120> percent<00:02:01.120> of<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.660> actual<00:02:01.990> breaking<00:02:02.380> an

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
five percent of the actual breaking an

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.900 
five percent of the actual breaking an
emergency<00:02:02.860> situation<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:03.550> it's<00:02:03.730> just

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
emergency situation like it's just

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.760 
emergency situation like it's just
ridiculous<00:02:04.600> because<00:02:05.200> all<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.380> break-ins<00:02:05.560> on

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
ridiculous because all the break-ins on

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.350 
ridiculous because all the break-ins on
the<00:02:05.860> front<00:02:06.040> tire<00:02:06.190> when<00:02:06.610> you're<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:07.060> an

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
the front tire when you're in an

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.210 
the front tire when you're in an
emergency<00:02:07.540> braking<00:02:07.990> situation<00:02:08.260> that<00:02:08.920> front

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
emergency braking situation that front

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.460 
emergency braking situation that front
brake<00:02:09.460> is<00:02:09.610> strong<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.420> they<00:02:10.899> say<00:02:11.050> like<00:02:11.080> in<00:02:11.380> an

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
brake is strong and they say like in an

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.900 
brake is strong and they say like in an
emergency<00:02:11.650> situation<00:02:11.830> you're<00:02:12.400> breaking<00:02:12.700> all

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
emergency situation you're breaking all

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.120 
emergency situation you're breaking all
with<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.360> front<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.260> if<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.650> break<00:02:14.860> with<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
with the front so if you break with the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.380 
with the front so if you break with the
rear<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.490> rear<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.730> barely<00:02:16.000> even<00:02:16.120> touched<00:02:16.300> on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
rear the rear is barely even touched on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.390 
rear the rear is barely even touched on
the<00:02:16.450> ground<00:02:16.660> anyways<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.070> break<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the ground anyways so if you break it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.650 
the ground anyways so if you break it
all<00:02:18.520> with<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.850> rear<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:19.120> Papi's<00:02:19.360> gonna<00:02:19.510> lock

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
all with the rear your Papi's gonna lock

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.240 
all with the rear your Papi's gonna lock
it<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:19.930> which<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.410> worse<00:02:21.630> yeah<00:02:23.250> anyways

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
it up which is worse yeah anyways

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.780
