00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:10.590
 for connecting this side seam 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.880
 need hook 3 on you here need 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.299
 will do the following 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.449
 to neatly connect do 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.800
 connection in this place will need 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.230
 pick out two pigtails on these two 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 details and make connections 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.730
 for loops that are next to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 watch out for those pigtails so that there is no 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 displacement then the seam will turn out exactly its 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.629
 almost not visible especially 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.700
 after you wash the thing and how 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.570
 it would be possible to even pat a little 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.520
 this seam has leveled so for a start to me 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.280
 you will need to select braids that is with 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.449
 one side here is my pigtail 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.430
 accordingly, I will touch here for 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.400
 these loops are on the other side a pigtail 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.520
 here and accordingly I have to touch 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 here for these loops and having decided on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.170
 loops now i will do 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:24.439
 connections and so I enter the hook into both 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.439
 connection loops fasten the thread and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 then we start to connect with 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.600
 polustolbikov that is the most important thing is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 do not stray from these eyelets that is, I 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 I insert the hook into the first loop then into 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:48.060
 second loop and pull the thread through 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.350
 all the resulting loops and so i need 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.210
 make until the end of this connection on 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.390
 the other side is such 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 seam if you don't collect 100 strictly 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 you get these two braids 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.810
 turn over from time to time 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.440
 work on the face and look not broken 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.330
 whether the sequence of the compound that is 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.900
 it turns out for two pigtails which you 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.900
 singled out 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.830
 so I finished the connection here is the front 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.180
 side that is if you stretch 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.370
 seam as it can be seen that the dice connection in 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.130
 normal stretched down state 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.500
 this seam is not visible the only thing 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.520
 it remains to do this fasten the thread 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.520
 there is a need to be here 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.890
 neatly 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.000
 You can knit a thread to fasten the thread and 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.000
 trim her
