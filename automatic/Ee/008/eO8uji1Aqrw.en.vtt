just<00:02:34.840> hope<00:02:35.080> they<00:02:35.290> don't<00:02:35.470> have<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.830> quickness

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
just hope they don't have the quickness

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.059 
just hope they don't have the quickness
to<00:02:36.610> match<00:02:36.819> their<00:02:37.090> size<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:38.440> how<00:02:38.739> are<00:02:38.950> we

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069
