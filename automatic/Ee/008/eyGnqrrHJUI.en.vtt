hip movements are really what's
generating<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.640> arm<00:02:29.850> movements<00:02:30.740> returning

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
generating the arm movements returning

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.060 
generating the arm movements returning
the<00:02:31.860> hips<00:02:32.070> sinking<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:33.500> raising<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> hip<00:02:34.830> and
