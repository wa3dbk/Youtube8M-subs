the<00:00:53.760> glue<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.960> drying<00:00:55.289> way<00:00:55.649> too<00:00:55.710> fast<00:00:56.100> by<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the glue is drying way too fast by the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.849 
the glue is drying way too fast by the
time<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.539> cap<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.649> like

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
time I put it on the cap it was like

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.990 
time I put it on the cap it was like
already<00:00:59.760> hard<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> had<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.129> pill<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.789> glue

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
already hard so I had to pill the glue

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.380 
already hard so I had to pill the glue
off<00:01:03.210> again<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.280> reshoot<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> glue<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
off again and reshoot the glue on the

that you can't take the glue gun and go
over<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> top<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> track<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
over it just at the top of the track and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.410 
over it just at the top of the track and
make<00:01:48.869> sure<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.470> secure<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.970> glue

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
make sure it's very secure but the glue

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.789 
make sure it's very secure but the glue
is<00:01:51.689> way<00:01:52.170> faster<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.590> know

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
is way faster you know you just know

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
is way faster you know you just know
what<00:01:55.890> you're<00:01:56.040> working<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.850> and

what you're working with you know and
you<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.439> work<00:01:58.799> way<00:01:59.219> faster<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> glue

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you just work way faster with the glue

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.819 
you just work way faster with the glue
um<00:02:02.149> like<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.270> said<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.509> will<00:02:03.899> try<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> glue<00:02:04.590> gun

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
um like I said I will try to glue gun

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.730 
um like I said I will try to glue gun
method<00:02:05.159> again<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.320> didn't<00:02:07.560> work<00:02:07.680> for

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
method again but it just didn't work for

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
method again but it just didn't work for
me<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> started<00:02:09.239> seeing<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.869> some

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
me and then I started seeing that some

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840 
me and then I started seeing that some
try<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.739> falling<00:02:11.280> like

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
try for falling like

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.880 
try for falling like
