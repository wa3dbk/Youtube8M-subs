00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.609
 good these attached to a new video 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.680
 well the truth I do not know if this justice 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.320
 real or false but good if it is false is 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.700
 very very very well made the truth good 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.050
 it seems that the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.070
 supposedly species are 4 slim in 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.210
 say that they have the picture of the Egyptian not 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.950
 he could put them on screen of what was said 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.050
 millions of times filtered things do not 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.970
 I can put them on the screen after 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.620
 ashton strike easily and has a lot 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.110
 pint of this be true yes that is 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.510
 true that the photoshop and many people 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.550
 he handled it like a motherfucker and these face 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.010
 can do perfectly but I do 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.980
 I have to play it I think it's 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.320
 quite realistic, I do not know if it will be 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.630
 true but that may be so in the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.300
 future because it has all the paint is not 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.530
 it 's pretty cool the size 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.450
 of the good console you have several 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.980
 pictures are worth several images in 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.200
 that you can see that as I say then 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.380
 removed quite part of the console and 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.360
 they have put the two buttons these of 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.060
 take out the disk 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.890
 and thus off because as I say it 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.150
 there they have saved themselves enough size 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.970
 has closed quite what I do not know very 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.280
 well where are the ports serene 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.190
 they will be behind or where they will be 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.500
 because you can not see any image 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.360
 behind but good as the usb ports 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.490
 they should also be out there I do not know I do not know 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.190
 in which part they are exactly but 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.530
 well just like that is a power fighter that is 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.170
 false and ximo but good as I say by the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.360
 size of consoles like twice of 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.900
 done there is an image showing the command 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.090
 from lahm 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.160
 of the play and it's basically like two 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.770
 controls of the play of great that is my 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.030
 seeing it is like two controls on the place 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.950
 put in this position one and the other 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.290
 as if I put all that big with 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.110
 which the size is quite small and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.840
 wide because I do not know if any image 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.630
 I'm looking right now wide 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.910
 could any one know how much wide they 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.290
 but well pretty reduced too 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.830
 seeing where the disk goes and 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.780
 other then almost half of reduction 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.300
 with which the size would fall quite 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.690
 supposedly it would be announced this 2015 in 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.520
 the e3 we will see to see what just happens and 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.929
 nothing to keep an eye on the images and 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.330
 tell me what you think seems to me very 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.250
 soon to assemble a slim console the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.780
 great seems very very soon and a little 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.970
 unnecessary in the case of precision 4 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.400
 because it 's pretty tiny but good 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.730
 nothing like emotion in the next video 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.730
 Boys
