it has a waterproof rating of ibx five

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.729 
it has a waterproof rating of ibx five
which<00:00:56.730> means<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.930> submersible

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
which means it's not it's submersible

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.580 
which means it's not it's submersible
but<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.940> take<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.539> steady<00:01:00.930> stream<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> water

thing<00:02:55.200> about<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:57.090> design

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
thing about this is the design

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.970 
thing about this is the design
physically<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.610> speaker<00:03:00.650> yeah<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:01.800> see

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
physically of this speaker yeah we see

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.100 
physically of this speaker yeah we see
it's<00:03:02.070> hard<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> tell<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.610> video<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:04.080> is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
it's hard to tell in the video but it is

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.560 
it's hard to tell in the video but it is
rock<00:03:04.680> solid<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.310> mean<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:05.610> really<00:03:06.120> really

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
rock solid I mean it is really really

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.460 
rock solid I mean it is really really
well<00:03:07.170> made<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:08.010> has<00:03:08.220> handles<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:09.209> both<00:03:09.470> ends

one<00:03:10.620> thing<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:10.950> about<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.700> could

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
one thing I like about that is you could

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.960 
one thing I like about that is you could
take<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:13.020> bungee<00:03:13.320> cord<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.010> strap<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.459> onto

an ATV or a kayak or just a bike or
anything<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:20.040> gonna<00:03:20.160> work<00:03:20.280> out<00:03:20.430> well

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
you can set it on its back like this and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.699 
you can set it on its back like this and
get<00:03:23.610> some<00:03:23.820> real<00:03:23.970> nice<00:03:24.290> 360-degree<00:03:25.290> sounds

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
get some real nice 360-degree sounds

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.740 
get some real nice 360-degree sounds
gonna<00:03:25.860> go<00:03:25.980> everywhere<00:03:26.160> or<00:03:26.820> if<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.480> want<00:03:27.660> a

more<00:03:27.870> focused<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.739> in<00:03:29.070> my<00:03:29.160> opinion<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.550> higher

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
more focused and in my opinion a higher

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.570 
more focused and in my opinion a higher
quality<00:03:30.330> sound<00:03:30.780> because<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.769> mean<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.010> shoots

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
quality sound because I mean it's shoots

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.370 
quality sound because I mean it's shoots
up<00:03:32.700> at<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.850> scene<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.180> any<00:03:33.330> any<00:03:33.720> speaker<00:03:34.140> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
up at the scene like any any speaker the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.990 
up at the scene like any any speaker the
sound<00:03:34.560> software<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:34.980> little<00:03:35.310> bit<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.910> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
sound software is a little bit but you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.080 
sound software is a little bit but you
can<00:03:36.030> still<00:03:36.300> hear<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.570> very<00:03:37.320> well<00:03:37.590> or<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.820> can

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
can still hear it very well or you can

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.710 
can still hear it very well or you can
flip<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.590> its<00:03:40.650> side<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.550> it's<00:03:42.239> it's<00:03:42.480> just

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
flip it on its side and it's it's just

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.330 
flip it on its side and it's it's just
fine<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.500> you're<00:03:44.040> gonna<00:03:44.130> get<00:03:44.280> a
