00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.600
 at the moment now as a dj 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.290
 good hello to all i am with 300 e 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.970
 how there is mum lasts especially 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.430
 watch it with its skin power 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 however we wanted to make this video 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:33.879
 because we have reached 2200 members 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.070
 so we wanted to do something 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.640
 special for the 2,200 cements 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.640
 obviously we left the scene 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.079
 commitments if I then have the maturity for 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.539
 example is therefore a mess anyway 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.860
 we wanted to do what's here because 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.050
 precisely the two thousand members are 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.170
 truly an important milestone i 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.910
 2,200 even more the 2,215 for the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.239
 precision that we have this now 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.700
 even more then or in the end 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.470
 all this introduction to tell me that 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:17.220
 we wanted to do a contest on 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 the first contest of the clippers now 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.790
 more questions 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.060
 requests what you win in this 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.909
 contest say it toubab you practice in 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.710
 contest will allow to do now 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.490
 we have yet to decide the mode 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.310
 however, either a video or more videos 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 let's take a series now how to structure it 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.289
 together not and therefore you subscribers 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.740
 could register with us 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.929
 the second question is how you can win 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.020
 this context 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.220
 then we have devised this method 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.619
 here 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.250
 in practice there is a page on youtube 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:04.299
 these see the writings of pin faces 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 that which are more involved in the la channel 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.709
 girl his gesture 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.569
 this is this here and the page where 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.810
 there are members of involved 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.190
 updated daily 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.959
 involvement as measured 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.709
 through i like it 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.650
 the comments described the descriptions 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.569
 video sharing and putting videos in 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.209
 favorite 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.360
 then after that after you enter 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.519
 in this list there are the first 87 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.700
 subscribers seems to me a title in general 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.480
 we will go to this page 40 a point 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.599
 org we will generate a number from 1 to 9 thousand e 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.900
 999 million then we will take the first one 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:49.230
 figure is not a complicated method though if 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.870
 i like to be complicated create the first one 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.230
 figure says then then let's go up 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.819
 this page and we will take the third 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.010
 written on this page 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.510
 in these things of the collapse therefore would have 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.530
 won lorenzo and box this is the method e 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.900
 or at least though it is completely intact 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.340
 random we do not risk doing politics like 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.410
 of the kind then once we will make the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.859
 video extraction point will be everything 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.799
 you'll probably have to live 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.720
 contact via message in Skype 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.930
 on the facebook page that we report about 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.850
 going to look for letters like let's put i 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.840
 our updates even when not 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.940
 we are active on the channel and therefore mi 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.750
 we will write there we will behave lire then 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.569
 we will decide the date of the exact date e 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.819
 also 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.930
 mode and could generally and then 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:52.129
 any payments 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 no no and so for this video I think 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.860
 let it all be played with us 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.909
 win, I recommend if all of you 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:08.209
 should win it at lucerna 500 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:15.500
 five hundred lemon-yellow abarths at 61 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:17.829
 at 37 c and e from her is everything even in the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.829
 world
