00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 I want to bring to your attention 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:10.860
 gas generator honda and q10 and let's 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.830
 let's see how it works top 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.960
 the station is the gas cap 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 well with the switch valve binding 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.359
 bucks atmosphere i mean when we 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.210
 transport the station in a car or 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.090
 somewhere else we turn off 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.630
 thereby completely seal 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.370
 station and excluding gas strait but 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.440
 when we need to start the station we 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:47.329
 switch the mode it further back 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.329
 stations are muffler openings 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:58.690
 one side suck to run in 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:02.370
 cold time self starter pen 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.370
 ignition on 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 at the front we see the outlet 220 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.060
 volt 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.430
 these two inputs are needed 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.170
 if you use two generators in a pair 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:24.550
 then they are combined through this input 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 this outlet for charging battery 12 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:33.510
 volt you have a maximum current of 8 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:36.060
 the vampire is the switch of the station 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.400
 that is, either quiet mode 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.280
 minimum turnovers and the station itself their 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.250
 increase by necessity either league 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 maximum station mode 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:53.040
 below are three LEDs 1 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 lights up green when starting and 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.619
 signals that everything is in order 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.410
 the station is running electricity 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:05.020
 the next LED is generated 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:07.140
 red color and so let's say 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.940
 Ignition speaks about some problems 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.360
 i.e. station overload or something 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.400
 also we are on this judging by 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.489
 icon should refer to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.769
 leadership and 3 last light bulb 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:25.840
 red color shows us about what 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:28.480
 oil level critical language with 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.200
 back side here basically nothing 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.440
 no 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.810
 there is only a cap through which 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.810
 we can access the candles 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.459
 ignition 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.330
 to promptly and and change 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.330
 respectively 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.750
 let's see how it starts 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.640
 that is, to run it translate 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.330
 the valve is in the position it is like ours 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.680
 here, in principle, not very cold choke 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:12.840
 touch will not turn on the switch 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.840
 and produce 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.760
 what stations work 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.520
 from see no you my payments 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.520
 no 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.410
 let's get a look 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.820
 how will the station lead when connected 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.330
 Bulgarians Bulgarian bosch 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.610
 900 watts 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.310
 as we see the grinder connection is not 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.410
 caused some problems at the station and 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.410
 the light is green 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:59.000
 let's go ahead and try 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:04.659
 connect another tool 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.659
 Well, for example grinding machine with park 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.050
 power 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.100
 1200 watts 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.580
 as we see with this task with this 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.580
 tasks station handled either
