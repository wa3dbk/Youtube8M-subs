thanks for playing now well I guess it's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.550 
thanks for playing now well I guess it's
actually<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.160> end<00:00:20.720> but<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.900> mean<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> guess<00:00:22.350> we

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
actually the end but I mean I guess we

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.990 
actually the end but I mean I guess we
check<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> source<00:00:23.100> code<00:00:23.279> real<00:00:23.430> quick<00:00:23.460> what's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
check the source code real quick what's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.279 
check the source code real quick what's
kinda<00:00:24.180> interesting<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> fact<00:00:25.019> that

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
kinda interesting here is the fact that

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.710 
kinda interesting here is the fact that
we<00:00:25.830> still<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.400> DLC<00:00:26.970> coming<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> he

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
we still have the DLC coming out and he

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.910 
we still have the DLC coming out and he
posted<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> end

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
posted the end

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.820 
posted the end
so<00:00:29.400> obviously<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> end<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.439> five<00:00:31.679> nights

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so obviously it's the end of five nights

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.610 
so obviously it's the end of five nights
at<00:00:32.040> freddys<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.430> guess<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.030> mean<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
at freddys I guess I mean if that is the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.350 
at freddys I guess I mean if that is the
case<00:00:34.770> though<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.219> what's<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> DLC<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.180> be

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
case though then what's the DLC gonna be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
case though then what's the DLC gonna be
you<00:00:36.630> know<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.870> kind<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> weird<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.190> guess

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you know it's kind of weird but I guess

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040 
you know it's kind of weird but I guess
we<00:00:38.579> try<00:00:38.670> saving<00:00:39.000> even<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.450> says<00:00:39.570> just

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
we try saving even see what it says just

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
we try saving even see what it says just
says<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> text<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.510> don't

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
says for as for the text I think I don't

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.150 
says for as for the text I think I don't
think<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> different<00:00:43.829> color<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.129> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
think this was a different color was it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.229 
think this was a different color was it
it<00:00:44.399> might<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.670> been<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.820> don't<00:00:44.910> actually

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it might have been I don't actually

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
it might have been I don't actually
remember<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.980> there's<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.190> much

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
remember but there's not really much

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.410 
remember but there's not really much
talking<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.329> just

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
talking about that on this one it just

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
talking about that on this one it just
simply<00:00:48.870> says<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> end<00:00:49.350> thanks<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:49.890> playing

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
simply says the end thanks for playing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340 
simply says the end thanks for playing
so<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.730> guess<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> end<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.020> five<00:00:52.199> nights

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so I guess it's the end of five nights

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.200 
so I guess it's the end of five nights
at<00:00:52.559> freddy's<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.969> said<00:00:54.030> before
