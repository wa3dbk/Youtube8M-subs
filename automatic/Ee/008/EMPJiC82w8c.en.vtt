00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.110 
I swear it ends up with a horrible like
it's<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.710> horrible<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.850> i<00:00:41.969> get

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it's just horrible and then if i get

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119 
it's just horrible and then if i get
like<00:00:42.270> priority<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.170> comes<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.649> perfectly

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
like priority it comes like perfectly

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.970 
like priority it comes like perfectly
fine<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:45.210> maybe<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.680> box

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
fine but maybe it's just because the box

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.510 
fine but maybe it's just because the box
isn't<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:48.079> as<00:00:49.079> big<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:49.980> probably<00:00:50.219> set

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
isn't like as big and they probably set

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
isn't like as big and they probably set
it<00:00:50.640> under<00:00:50.910> something<00:00:51.239> i<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.260> it's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.240 
things that can do it can be a lot of
things<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.149> back<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.939> now<00:02:02.939> here

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
things and then on the back it now here

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.780 
things and then on the back it now here
is<00:02:05.250> pretty<00:02:05.549> much

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
is pretty much

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.040 
is pretty much
what<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.840> can<00:02:07.990> do<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:10.000> there's<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:10.840> then

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
what it can do so there's that and then

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.460 
what it can do so there's that and then
it<00:02:11.170> shows<00:02:12.210> all<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.270> different<00:02:13.510> things<00:02:13.900> and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
not going to go over this too much but

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.210 
not going to go over this too much but
it<00:03:22.690> came<00:03:22.840> with<00:03:23.019> some<00:03:23.170> nice<00:03:23.350> instructions<00:03:23.950> and

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
it came with some nice instructions and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.270 
it came with some nice instructions and
that<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.790> very<00:03:24.820> good<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.690> then<00:03:26.380> here<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
that is very good and then here is the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.020 
that is very good and then here is the
programming<00:03:30.280> port<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:32.310> needed<00:03:33.310> to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
programming port so that is needed to

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.970 
programming port so that is needed to
install<00:03:34.239> everything<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:35.350> luckily<00:03:35.680> they

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
install everything so luckily they

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.610 
install everything so luckily they
included<00:03:36.549> that<00:03:36.820> I<00:03:37.090> did<00:03:37.660> not<00:03:37.690> get<00:03:38.019> one<00:03:38.049> with<00:03:38.410> my

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
included that I did not get one with my

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.970 
included that I did not get one with my
first<00:03:38.860> one<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:40.209> does<00:03:40.510> suck<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:40.810> at<00:03:41.709> least

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
first one so that does suck but at least

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.740 
first one so that does suck but at least
it<00:03:42.220> came<00:03:42.400> with<00:03:42.549> this<00:03:42.670> one<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.150> then<00:03:43.239> here<00:03:43.600> is

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
it came with this one and then here is

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.860 
it came with this one and then here is
the<00:03:43.989> newest<00:03:44.500> model<00:03:45.310> as<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:46.510> see<00:03:46.660> they

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the newest model as you can see they

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.979 
the newest model as you can see they
have<00:03:47.049> changed<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.010> logo<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.630> front<00:03:49.810> and

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
have changed the logo on the front and

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.210 
have changed the logo on the front and
then<00:03:50.140> they<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.440> also<00:03:50.950> changed<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:53.220> button

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
then they have also changed the button

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.850 
then they have also changed the button
it<00:03:54.400> is<00:03:54.519> clear<00:03:54.940> now<00:03:55.180> instead<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:55.989> by<00:03:56.799> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
it is clear now instead of by the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.000 
it is clear now instead of by the
matching<00:03:57.820> color<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.590> device<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:01.860> then<00:04:02.860> on

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
matching color of the device and then on

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.580 
matching color of the device and then on
the<00:04:03.130> back<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:05.769> have<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:07.030> website<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.410> then

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
the back you have the website and then

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:17.770 
the back you have the website and then
Cronus<00:04:09.070> max<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.880> then<00:04:10.470> there's<00:04:11.470> output

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.690 

alright<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:21.780> if<00:04:22.230> i<00:04:22.440> remember<00:04:22.770> correctly<00:04:23.370> they

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
alright so if i remember correctly they

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.700 
alright so if i remember correctly they
did<00:04:24.090> fix<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.630> usb<00:04:25.200> on<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.410> bottom<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:27.200> be<00:04:28.200> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
did fix the usb on the bottom to be the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.620 
did fix the usb on the bottom to be the
correct<00:04:29.040> way<00:04:29.400> now<00:04:29.610> instead<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.000> upside<00:04:30.240> down

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
correct way now instead of upside down

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.230 
correct way now instead of upside down
hopefully<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.590> correct<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:33.120> they

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
hopefully that is correct and then they

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.500 
hopefully that is correct and then they
have<00:04:33.450> their<00:04:33.750> little<00:04:33.960> cereal<00:04:34.590> sticker<00:04:35.010> now

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
have their little cereal sticker now

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.200 
have their little cereal sticker now
covering<00:04:36.510> up<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:38.330> seal<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.650> then<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:41.790> pc

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
covering up the seal and then the pc

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.680 
covering up the seal and then the pc
programming<00:04:42.960> port<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.090> for<00:04:45.300> the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
programming port so that is it for the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.110 
programming port so that is it for the
unboxing<00:04:45.870> video<00:04:46.740> i<00:04:46.800> am<00:04:47.100> going<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.400> be<00:04:47.580> doing<00:04:47.760> a
