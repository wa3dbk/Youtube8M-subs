00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
put a pan under catch it I just let it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.010 
put a pan under catch it I just let it
dip<00:02:26.070> down<00:02:26.250> there<00:02:26.490> it's<00:02:27.420> still<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> little<00:02:27.810> bit

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
dip down there it's still a little bit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.380 
dip down there it's still a little bit
now<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.380> another<00:02:28.680> day<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.150> worry
