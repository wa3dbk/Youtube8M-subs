and pigment in my brush and if I lay
that<00:01:22.940> into<00:01:23.510> this<00:01:28.689> you'll<00:01:29.689> notice<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.200> the

that into this you'll notice that the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.679 
that into this you'll notice that the

the<00:01:38.689> edge<00:01:38.810> becomes<00:01:39.259> raggedy<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.310> more<00:01:40.610> water

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
the edge becomes raggedy the more water

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.800 
the edge becomes raggedy the more water
you<00:01:41.090> add<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.229> risk<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.890> background<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:43.810> what

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
you add you risk a background and what

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.840 
you add you risk a background and what
happens<00:01:45.200> with<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.380> back<00:01:45.619> run<00:01:45.890> or<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> bloom<00:01:46.580> and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
happens with a back run or a bloom and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.910 
happens with a back run or a bloom and
that's<00:01:47.330> starting<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.810> occur<00:01:48.170> right<00:01:48.350> here<00:01:48.409> is

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that's starting to occur right here is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.429 
that's starting to occur right here is
that<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.340> carry<00:01:49.610> more<00:01:49.970> water<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.960> your<00:01:51.140> brush

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
that you carry more water in your brush

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.030 
that you carry more water in your brush
more<00:01:52.040> water<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.579> pigment<00:01:53.030> than<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:54.259> relative

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
more water and pigment than the relative

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.450 
more water and pigment than the relative
wetness<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.900> passage<00:01:57.409> of<00:01:57.590> pigment<00:01:58.310> that's

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
wetness of the passage of pigment that's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.120 
wetness of the passage of pigment that's
on<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.909> paper<00:01:59.259> I'm<00:02:00.259> talking<00:02:00.770> now<00:02:00.890> for<00:02:01.100> a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
little while and this quinacridone gold

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.219 
little while and this quinacridone gold
wash<00:02:03.740> has<00:02:03.979> had<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> chance<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.939> start<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> dry<00:02:05.689> as

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
wash has had a chance to start to dry as

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.810 
wash has had a chance to start to dry as
a<00:02:06.350> matter<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.649> fact<00:02:06.829> some<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> shine<00:02:07.610> is

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
a matter of fact some of the shine is

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.609 
a matter of fact some of the shine is
starting<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.299> disappear<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.959> this<00:02:09.079> area<00:02:09.440> right

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
starting to disappear in this area right

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.830 
starting to disappear in this area right
here<00:02:09.679> what<00:02:10.429> I'm<00:02:10.519> going<00:02:10.579> to<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:10.850> now<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.600> make

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
here what I'm going to do now is make

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.430 
here what I'm going to do now is make
another<00:02:12.260> passage<00:02:12.829> through<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.820> area<00:02:14.440> which

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
another passage through that area which

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.190 
another passage through that area which
should<00:02:15.739> appear<00:02:16.040> differently<00:02:16.459> I've<00:02:17.299> removed<00:02:17.930> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
should appear differently I've removed a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.660 
should appear differently I've removed a
lot<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.680> moisture<00:02:19.160> from<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.609> brush

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
lot of the moisture from this brush

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.480 
lot of the moisture from this brush
it's<00:02:21.819> no<00:02:22.030> longer<00:02:22.240> dripping<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.920> pigment

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
it's no longer dripping and the pigment

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.780 
it's no longer dripping and the pigment
load<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.940> picked<00:02:25.240> up<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.959> very<00:02:26.290> stiff<00:02:27.100> it

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
load that I picked up is very stiff it

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.780 
load that I picked up is very stiff it
doesn't<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.390> nearly<00:02:28.840> as<00:02:29.140> much<00:02:29.380> water

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
doesn't have nearly as much water

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.180 
doesn't have nearly as much water
carrying<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.910> pigment<00:02:31.330> as<00:02:31.450> these<00:02:32.200> shapes<00:02:32.770> do

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
carrying the pigment as these shapes do

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.610 
carrying the pigment as these shapes do
and<00:02:33.610> if<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.209> make<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> passage<00:02:35.020> through<00:02:35.380> this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
and if I make a passage through this

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.300 
and if I make a passage through this
area

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
area

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.390 
area
notice<00:02:37.090> how<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.569> edge<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.410> soft<00:02:38.740> but<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
notice how the edge is soft but the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.780 
notice how the edge is soft but the
stroke<00:02:39.900> retains<00:02:40.900> its<00:02:41.350> definition<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.250> this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
stroke retains its definition and this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.270 
stroke retains its definition and this
kind<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.510> moisture<00:02:43.959> control<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.740> something

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
kind of moisture control is something

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.760 
kind of moisture control is something
that<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.760> really<00:02:46.030> need<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.840> learn<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.560> able

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
that you really need to learn to be able

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.130 
that you really need to learn to be able
to<00:02:47.860> handle<00:02:48.250> wet<00:02:48.459> in<00:02:48.580> wet<00:02:48.730> passages<00:02:49.420> these

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
to handle wet in wet passages these

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.250 
to handle wet in wet passages these
shapes<00:02:50.950> look<00:02:51.819> very<00:02:52.209> nice<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> soft

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
shapes look very nice we have a soft

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.560 
shapes look very nice we have a soft
edge<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> little<00:02:54.370> harder<00:02:54.850> edge<00:02:55.030> here<00:02:55.420> when

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
edge here a little harder edge here when

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.510 
edge here a little harder edge here when
I<00:02:55.600> first<00:02:55.900> started<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.530> stroke<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.010> they

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
I first started the stroke and they

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.210 
I first started the stroke and they
retain<00:02:57.940> their<00:02:58.180> definition<00:02:58.810> when<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.590> carry<00:02:59.920> too

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
retain their definition when I carry too

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.460 
retain their definition when I carry too
much<00:03:00.430> water<00:03:00.730> notice<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> edge<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.260> quite

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
much water notice that the edge is quite

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.310 
much water notice that the edge is quite
raggedy<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.760> definition<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.540> not<00:03:04.570> very

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
raggedy and the definition is not very

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.320 
raggedy and the definition is not very
good<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.620> these<00:03:05.800> shapes

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
good in these shapes

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.390 
good in these shapes
