different team when Vic is not in the
game<00:02:23.160> absolutely<00:02:24.090> uh<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.140> there's<00:02:25.320> just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
so many less threats that a defense

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
so many less threats that a defense
would<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.040> cover<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:30.210> know<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
would have to cover as we know the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.240 
would have to cover as we know the
Giants<00:02:30.720> are<00:02:30.990> banged<00:02:31.290> up<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> back<00:02:31.950> end<00:02:32.190> of

Giants are banged up in the back end of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.210 
Giants are banged up in the back end of
the<00:02:32.310> secondary<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.320> are<00:02:34.320> very<00:02:34.500> weak<00:02:34.860> at<00:02:35.070> that

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
the secondary and are very weak at that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.090 
the secondary and are very weak at that
spot<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.240> if<00:02:36.480> Vic<00:02:36.930> does<00:02:37.140> not<00:02:37.320> play<00:02:37.650> are<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
spot but if Vic does not play are the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.770 
spot but if Vic does not play are the
Eagles<00:02:38.490> going<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:38.820> able<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.150> exploit<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
Eagles going to be able to exploit the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.840 
Eagles going to be able to exploit the
vertical<00:02:40.230> pass<00:02:40.440> routes<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.070> probably<00:02:41.490> think

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
vertical pass routes I probably think

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.080 
vertical pass routes I probably think
know<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.440> that's<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.040> game<00:02:44.310> where<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.820> think

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
know so that that's a game where I think

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.210 
know so that that's a game where I think
the<00:02:45.180> line<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.990> coming<00:02:46.680> interesting<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> see

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the line is coming interesting to see

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.680 
the line is coming interesting to see
what<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.460> line<00:02:47.760> does<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.330> must<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.630> been

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
what that line does that must have been

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.420 
what that line does that must have been
a<00:02:48.750> very<00:02:48.810> hard<00:02:49.200> line<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.590> come<00:02:49.770> up<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.160> by<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
a very hard line to come up with by the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.300 
a very hard line to come up with by the
oddsmakers<00:02:51.330> yeah<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.560> was<00:02:52.650> quite<00:02:52.890> honest<00:02:53.190> I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
oddsmakers yeah it was quite honest I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
oddsmakers yeah it was quite honest I
would<00:02:53.490> have<00:02:53.640> known<00:02:54.090> where<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.360> make<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.750> six<00:02:55.080> or

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
would have known where to make it six or

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.230 
point favorite at home against
Jacksonville<00:05:17.340> obviously<00:05:17.760> team<00:05:18.000> with<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> lot

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
Jacksonville obviously team with a lot

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
of problems and questions I think that

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.700 
of problems and questions I think that
might<00:05:20.220> be<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.400> good<00:05:20.460> bet<00:05:21.260> yeah<00:05:22.260> I<00:05:22.289> was<00:05:22.590> leaning

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
might be a good bet yeah I was leaning

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.770 
might be a good bet yeah I was leaning
on<00:05:22.889> Caroline<00:05:23.370> until<00:05:23.729> proven<00:05:24.060> wrong<00:05:24.240> well

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
on Caroline until proven wrong well

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.900 
on Caroline until proven wrong well
obviously<00:05:25.380> Cam<00:05:25.919> Newton's<00:05:26.220> rookie<00:05:26.580> he's<00:05:26.759> gonna

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
obviously Cam Newton's rookie he's gonna

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.100 
obviously Cam Newton's rookie he's gonna
have<00:05:27.120> one<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.330> those<00:05:27.389> games<00:05:27.630> where<00:05:27.810> he's<00:05:28.020> gonna

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
have one of those games where he's gonna

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.170 
have one of those games where he's gonna
throw<00:05:28.380> four<00:05:28.800> interceptions<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.610> then<00:05:29.880> it

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
throw four interceptions and then it

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.790 
throw four interceptions and then it
happens<00:05:30.599> to<00:05:30.720> every<00:05:30.900> single<00:05:31.050> rookie<00:05:31.440> who<00:05:31.500> ever

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800

couple<00:05:36.180> of<00:05:36.330> years<00:05:37.070> Jacksonville<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:38.340> know<00:05:38.400> is

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
couple of years Jacksonville you know is

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.600 
couple of years Jacksonville you know is
a<00:05:38.639> defensive<00:05:39.150> minded<00:05:39.510> team<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:41.190> could<00:05:41.370> cause

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
a defensive minded team that could cause

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.610 
a defensive minded team that could cause
some<00:05:41.639> problems<00:05:41.940> for<00:05:42.270> for<00:05:42.810> Newton<00:05:43.139> but<00:05:43.320> you

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
some problems for for Newton but you

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.140 
some problems for for Newton but you
know<00:05:43.680> quite<00:05:43.860> frankly<00:05:43.919> Newton's<00:05:44.699> been<00:05:44.880> able<00:05:45.060> to

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
know quite frankly Newton's been able to

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.529 
know quite frankly Newton's been able to
make<00:05:45.300> reads<00:05:45.659> and<00:05:46.550> defenses<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:48.180> thought

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
make reads and defenses that I thought

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.000 
make reads and defenses that I thought
were<00:05:48.720> remarkable<00:05:49.349> that<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:49.710> know<00:05:49.800> some

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
were remarkable that you know some

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.670 
were remarkable that you know some
quarterbacks<00:05:50.370> never<00:05:50.970> really<00:05:51.300> graphs<00:05:51.680> getting

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
them they look at the number one

them they look at the number one
receiver<00:06:14.789> and<00:06:15.090> then<00:06:15.180> they'll<00:06:15.330> check<00:06:15.570> down<00:06:15.780> it

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050

happens<00:06:16.289> in<00:06:16.380> college<00:06:16.770> too<00:06:16.979> but<00:06:17.270> Newton

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
happens in college too but Newton

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.080 
happens in college too but Newton
actually<00:06:18.690> surveys<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.500> field<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.070> and<00:06:20.880> I

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
actually surveys the field and and I

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.670 
actually surveys the field and and I
think<00:06:21.270> that's<00:06:21.479> one<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.870> most<00:06:22.110> incredible

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
think that's one of the most incredible

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.840 
think that's one of the most incredible
things<00:06:22.979> of<00:06:23.159> his<00:06:23.280> of<00:06:23.970> his<00:06:24.090> first<00:06:24.449> two<00:06:24.630> games
