00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.490 

let<00:00:06.029> me<00:00:06.150> show<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.390> how<00:00:06.600> we<00:00:06.660> can<00:00:06.930> use<00:00:07.170> elastic

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
let me show you how we can use elastic

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.980 
let me show you how we can use elastic
time<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.220> improve<00:00:08.610> or<00:00:08.910> correct<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.389> timing<00:00:09.900> of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
time to improve or correct the timing of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.410 
time to improve or correct the timing of
a<00:00:10.170> multitrack<00:00:10.650> drum<00:00:10.710> performance<00:00:11.090> now<00:00:12.090> there

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
a multitrack drum performance now there

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.180 
a multitrack drum performance now there
are<00:00:12.540> two<00:00:12.690> ways<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.590> could<00:00:13.799> simply

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
are two ways to do this we could simply

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.580 
are two ways to do this we could simply
quantize<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.120> entire<00:00:15.509> performance<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.350> one

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
quantize the entire performance in one

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.310 
quantize the entire performance in one
go<00:00:16.859> using<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> event<00:00:17.880> operations<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:19.080> we

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
go using the event operations or we

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.689 
go using the event operations or we
could<00:00:19.470> go<00:00:19.650> through<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.160> manually<00:00:20.580> adjust

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
could go through and manually adjust

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.970 
could go through and manually adjust
each<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.570> every<00:00:21.750> drum<00:00:21.990> head<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.619> gives<00:00:22.890> you

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
each and every drum head which gives you

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
each and every drum head which gives you
greater<00:00:23.250> control<00:00:23.369> over<00:00:23.910> your<00:00:24.150> editing<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.350> as

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
greater control over your editing now as

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
greater control over your editing now as
with<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.220> multitrack<00:00:26.760> drum<00:00:26.820> editing

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
with all multitrack drum editing

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.179 
with all multitrack drum editing
maintaining<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> phase<00:00:28.410> relationship

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
maintaining the phase relationship

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
maintaining the phase relationship
between<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.880> different<00:00:30.210> microphones<00:00:30.840> that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
between the different microphones that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
between the different microphones that
were<00:00:31.140> placed<00:00:31.410> around<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> kit<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.250> absolutely

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
were placed around the kit is absolutely

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.180 
were placed around the kit is absolutely
critical<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.020> we'll<00:00:34.290> talk<00:00:34.500> more<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
critical and we'll talk more about that

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.310 
critical and we'll talk more about that

that's<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:03.970> time<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.870> let's<00:02:05.080> hear<00:02:05.260> it<00:02:05.410> with<00:02:05.650> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
that's in time so let's hear it with the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:16.230 
that's in time so let's hear it with the
drums<00:02:06.100> yeah<00:02:13.560> he's<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.070> far<00:02:15.490> out<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:16.000> that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
drums yeah he's just so far out on that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.949 
drums yeah he's just so far out on that
drum<00:02:16.570> feel

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
drum feel

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.560 
drum feel
so<00:02:17.800> before<00:02:18.220> we<00:02:18.340> kinetic<00:02:18.760> we<00:02:18.880> need<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.209> turn<00:02:19.390> on

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
so before we kinetic we need to turn on

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.000 
so before we kinetic we need to turn on
the<00:02:19.690> elastic<00:02:20.110> time<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.650> going<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.830> choose

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
the elastic time so I'm going to choose

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.280 
the elastic time so I'm going to choose
rhythmic<00:02:21.490> as<00:02:21.640> an<00:02:21.910> algorithm<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.990> can<00:02:23.140> see

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
rhythmic as an algorithm and you can see

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.020 
rhythmic as an algorithm and you can see
the<00:02:23.410> files<00:02:23.650> go<00:02:23.920> offline<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:24.490> they're<00:02:24.850> being

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the files go offline as they're being

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.420 
the files go offline as they're being
analyzed<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.500> group<00:02:26.709> we<00:02:26.830> made<00:02:27.010> earlier

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
analyzed and the group we made earlier

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.550 
analyzed and the group we made earlier
lets<00:02:27.760> us<00:02:27.940> change<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.480> track<00:02:28.750> view<00:02:28.990> across<00:02:29.290> all

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
lets us change the track view across all

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.400 
lets us change the track view across all
tracks<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.250> his<00:02:30.459> analysis<00:02:31.090> view<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.570> his

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
tracks to his analysis view and his

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.050 
tracks to his analysis view and his
warped<00:02:32.770> view<00:02:32.980> which<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.370> where<00:02:33.550> I'm<00:02:33.790> going<00:02:33.970> to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
warped view which is where I'm going to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.600 
warped view which is where I'm going to
be<00:02:34.180> working<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.709> I'm<00:02:35.890> gonna<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.160> using<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
be working so I'm gonna be using the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.490 
be working so I'm gonna be using the
event<00:02:36.820> operations<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.840> turn<00:02:38.050> all<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.290> these

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
event operations to turn all of these

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.740 
event operations to turn all of these
event<00:02:38.920> markers<00:02:39.370> into<00:02:39.670> warp<00:02:39.970> markers<00:02:40.480> and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
event markers into warp markers and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.800 
event markers into warp markers and
quantize<00:02:41.440> them<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.740> agree<00:02:42.040> let<00:02:42.459> me<00:02:42.550> show<00:02:42.730> you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
quantize them to agree let me show you

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.180 
quantize them to agree let me show you
so<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.930> first<00:02:44.140> thing<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.350> do<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.740> make<00:02:45.130> a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
so the first thing I do is make a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.759 
so the first thing I do is make a
selection<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.910> zoom<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.900> now<00:02:47.080> I'm<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.709> to

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
selection and zoom in now I'm going to

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.890 
selection and zoom in now I'm going to
manually<00:02:48.190> insert<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> warp<00:02:48.940> marker<00:02:49.300> before<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
manually insert a warp marker before the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.590 
manually insert a warp marker before the
selection<00:02:50.230> by<00:02:50.530> ctrl-clicking<00:02:51.390> I'll<00:02:52.390> also

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
selection by ctrl-clicking I'll also

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.270 
selection by ctrl-clicking I'll also
place<00:02:52.959> one<00:02:52.989> at<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.530> end<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.070> selection

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
place one at the end of the selection

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.520 
place one at the end of the selection
now<00:02:55.209> I'm<00:02:55.540> doing<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.170> ensure<00:02:56.500> that

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
now I'm doing this to ensure that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.620 
now I'm doing this to ensure that
nothing<00:02:57.130> outside<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.820> selection<00:02:58.209> gets

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
nothing outside of that selection gets

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.930 
nothing outside of that selection gets
moved<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.800> just<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.130> precaution<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:00.760> it's

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
moved it's just a precaution but it's

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.790 
moved it's just a precaution but it's
one<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.120> do<00:03:01.269> like<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.750> take<00:03:01.989> when<00:03:02.410> I'm<00:03:02.560> doing

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
one I do like to take when I'm doing

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.330 
one I do like to take when I'm doing
this<00:03:02.890> type<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.280> multitrack<00:03:04.180> drum<00:03:04.239> editing<00:03:05.340> so

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
this type of multitrack drum editing so

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.160 
this type of multitrack drum editing so
let's<00:03:06.519> zoom<00:03:06.790> toggle<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.600> can<00:03:07.780> see<00:03:07.930> all<00:03:08.140> of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
let's zoom toggle and you can see all of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.140 
let's zoom toggle and you can see all of
the<00:03:08.410> event<00:03:08.709> markers<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.280> want<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.820> turn<00:03:09.970> these

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
the event markers I want to turn these

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.360 
the event markers I want to turn these
into<00:03:10.420> warp<00:03:10.840> markers<00:03:11.260> by<00:03:11.410> quantizing<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.280> I'm

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
into warp markers by quantizing so I'm

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.789 
into warp markers by quantizing so I'm
going<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:12.549> option<00:03:13.000> or<00:03:13.209> alt<00:03:13.480> zero<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:14.410> open<00:03:14.709> the

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
going to option or alt zero to open the

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.280 
going to option or alt zero to open the
event<00:03:14.890> operations<00:03:15.519> now<00:03:16.420> with<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.720> 16th<00:03:17.110> note

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
event operations now with the 16th note

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.110 
event operations now with the 16th note
values<00:03:17.620> selected<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.370> fix<00:03:18.580> all<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.970> these

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
values selected I can fix all of these

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.560 
values selected I can fix all of these
in<00:03:19.330> one<00:03:19.840> go<00:03:20.320> well<00:03:21.070> almost<00:03:21.340> everything<00:03:21.970> there's

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
in one go well almost everything there's

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.850 
in one go well almost everything there's
a<00:03:22.660> couple<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.989> items<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.470> we'll<00:03:23.620> need<00:03:23.799> to

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
a couple of items that we'll need to

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.180 
a couple of items that we'll need to
address<00:03:24.549> manually<00:03:25.560> now<00:03:26.560> there<00:03:26.950> are<00:03:27.040> any

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
address manually now there are any

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.070 
address manually now there are any
number<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.580> reasons<00:03:28.090> why<00:03:28.299> these<00:03:28.540> transients

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
number of reasons why these transients

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.140 
number of reasons why these transients
didn't<00:03:29.290> get<00:03:29.410> moved<00:03:29.709> or<00:03:30.040> quantized<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:30.970> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
didn't get moved or quantized to the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.820 
didn't get moved or quantized to the
correct<00:03:31.450> position<00:03:31.600> but<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.470> doesn't<00:03:32.739> really

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
correct position but it doesn't really

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.710 
correct position but it doesn't really
matter<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.549> does<00:03:33.790> matter<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.209> they<00:03:34.540> need

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
matter what does matter is they need

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.140 
matter what does matter is they need
fixing<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.350> I'm<00:03:35.530> gonna<00:03:35.680> do<00:03:35.860> that<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.910> I'm<00:03:37.000> just

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
fixing and I'm gonna do that so I'm just

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.570 
fixing and I'm gonna do that so I'm just
gonna<00:03:37.239> zoom<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:37.780> on<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.170> section<00:03:38.440> here<00:03:38.860> now

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
gonna zoom in on this section here now

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.490 
gonna zoom in on this section here now
this<00:03:39.850> wall<00:03:40.090> markers<00:03:40.540> should<00:03:40.690> actually<00:03:40.930> be<00:03:41.320> on

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
this wall markers should actually be on

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.560 
this wall markers should actually be on
the<00:03:41.769> snare<00:03:42.040> drum<00:03:42.100> however<00:03:42.940> something<00:03:43.239> on<00:03:43.450> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
the snare drum however something on the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.720 
the snare drum however something on the
higher<00:03:43.780> trunk<00:03:44.200> was<00:03:44.410> closer<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.250> quantize

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
higher trunk was closer to the quantize

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.940 
higher trunk was closer to the quantize
grid<00:03:46.030> well<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.750> not<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.959> problem<00:03:47.260> what<00:03:47.920> I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
grid well this is not a problem what I

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.949 
grid well this is not a problem what I
