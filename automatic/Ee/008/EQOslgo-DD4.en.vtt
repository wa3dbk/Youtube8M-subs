00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
before we do that let's make sure that

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.260 
before we do that let's make sure that
our<00:01:05.800> absent<00:01:06.310> artisan<00:01:06.730> is<00:01:06.880> up<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.150> running

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
our absent artisan is up and running

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.870 
our absent artisan is up and running
properly<00:01:07.900> here<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.680> maintenance<00:01:08.980> tab<00:01:09.430> you

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
properly here in the maintenance tab you

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.670 
properly here in the maintenance tab you
can<00:01:10.000> see<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.180> lot<00:01:10.420> of<00:01:10.450> different<00:01:10.840> options<00:01:11.020> and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
can see a lot of different options and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.990 
can see a lot of different options and
you'll<00:01:11.830> probably<00:01:12.010> want<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.550> start<00:01:12.760> off<00:01:12.970> by

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
you'll probably want to start off by

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.710 
you'll probably want to start off by
running<00:01:13.480> a<00:01:13.600> nozzle<00:01:14.050> check<00:01:18.240> doing<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.450> will

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
running a nozzle check doing this will

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.600 
running a nozzle check doing this will
give<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.200> test<00:01:20.710> pattern<00:01:21.040> that<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.430> can

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
give you a test pattern that you can

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.790 
give you a test pattern that you can
actually<00:01:21.850> compare<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.780> what<00:01:23.260> we're<00:01:23.410> seeing<00:01:23.620> on

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
actually compare to what we're seeing on

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.260 
actually compare to what we're seeing on
the<00:01:23.920> screen<00:01:24.040> here<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.910> there's<00:01:25.120> any

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
the screen here if there's any

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.030 
the screen here if there's any
discrepancies<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.410> might<00:01:26.620> want<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.890> run

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
discrepancies you might want to run

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.370 
discrepancies you might want to run
ahead<00:01:27.160> cleaning<00:01:27.820> but<00:01:28.420> if<00:01:28.510> it<00:01:28.600> matches<00:01:28.780> up<00:01:29.110> good

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
ahead cleaning but if it matches up good

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.710 
ahead cleaning but if it matches up good
that<00:01:30.220> means<00:01:30.400> your<00:01:30.550> Epson<00:01:30.880> Artisan<00:01:31.060> is<00:01:31.480> good

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
that means your Epson Artisan is good

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.870 
that means your Epson Artisan is good
and<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:33.310> good

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
and that's good

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.340 
and that's good
let<00:01:34.600> me<00:01:34.690> show<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.930> what<00:01:35.050> one<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.170> these<00:01:35.290> things

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
let me show you what one of these things

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.720 
let me show you what one of these things
looks<00:01:35.710> like<00:01:37.920> everything<00:01:38.920> looks<00:01:39.100> perfect

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
looks like everything looks perfect

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.480 
looks like everything looks perfect
so<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.420> know<00:01:40.600> I'm<00:01:40.840> good<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.110> go<00:01:41.140> no<00:01:42.070> need<00:01:42.220> for<00:01:42.460> a

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
so I know I'm good to go no need for a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
so I know I'm good to go no need for a
head<00:01:42.610> cleaning<00:01:42.970> if<00:01:43.800> we<00:01:44.800> really<00:01:45.130> wanted<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.610> we

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
head cleaning if we really wanted to we

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.080 
head cleaning if we really wanted to we
could<00:01:47.320> run<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> head<00:01:47.860> cleaning<00:01:48.280> right<00:01:48.700> here

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
could run the head cleaning right here

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.720 
could run the head cleaning right here
as<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.690> next<00:01:49.960> option<00:01:50.440> sometimes<00:01:51.370> you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
as it's the next option sometimes you

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.100 
as it's the next option sometimes you
might<00:01:51.880> need<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.210> run<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.510> printhead<00:01:53.020> alignment

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
might need to run a printhead alignment

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.230 
might need to run a printhead alignment
you'll<00:01:53.980> know<00:01:54.160> if<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.430> ever<00:01:54.460> need<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.790> do<00:01:55.030> this

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
you'll know if you ever need to do this

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.930 
you'll know if you ever need to do this
the<00:01:55.510> easiest<00:01:55.930> way<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.230> tell<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.860> if<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.610> text

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
the easiest way to tell is if the text

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.790 
the easiest way to tell is if the text
seems<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.240> little<00:01:58.330> bit<00:01:58.570> jagged<00:01:58.900> or<00:01:59.140> unclear

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
seems a little bit jagged or unclear

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.100 
seems a little bit jagged or unclear
there's<00:02:00.730> also<00:02:00.940> printer<00:02:01.480> and<00:02:01.660> option

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
there's also printer and option

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.160 
there's also printer and option
information<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:04.330> course<00:02:04.630> if<00:02:04.870> you're<00:02:05.140> not

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
information and of course if you're not

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.100 
information and of course if you're not
sure<00:02:05.770> but<00:02:06.340> you're<00:02:06.670> thinking<00:02:07.330> there<00:02:07.720> might<00:02:08.080> be
