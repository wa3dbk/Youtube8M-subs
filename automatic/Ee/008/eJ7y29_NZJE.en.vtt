relief from the conditions of that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.080 
relief from the conditions of that
endured<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:42.780> several<00:00:43.140> years<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.829> 46<00:00:44.430> 47<00:00:44.850> when

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
endured for several years in 46 47 when

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.060 
endured for several years in 46 47 when
England<00:00:45.360> came<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.780> he<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.559> reluctant

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to play again and I think he only played

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
to play again and I think he only played
again<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.360> he<00:00:51.570> felt<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
again then because he felt it was the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.740 
again then because he felt it was the
right<00:00:52.320> thing<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.920> cricket<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> then
