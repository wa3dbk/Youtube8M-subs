00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.730
 I wanted you from me in this video 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.599
 my review of the samsung multimedia 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.620
 show dock 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.020
 and have fun with this video 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.940
 scope of delivery with a price of around 50 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.100
 euro to the scope of delivery of the double 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.430
 of course once the dock itself 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.540
 normal power adapter from samsung in white 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.040
 a user manual and 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.620
 Caption everything was in it again 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.700
 is from the multimedia dock and then 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.310
 last still a white micro USB cable 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.200
 look and process the samsung 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.630
 Multimedia dock was actually for that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
 samsung galaxy note 2, however, designs 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.650
 You can do all sorts of things in this day 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.720
 Samsung devices are almost the same 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.460
 have the same thickness and size 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.489
 these are devices like for example 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.920
 the samsung galaxy s series samsung 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.610
 galaxy note a few others 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 equipment 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.810
 It is very well installed and appears 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.760
 with a very smart look it is in 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.590
 White is also kept so much that one 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.720
 the mobile phone can use it very well 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.880
 functions the dock has in any case 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.530
 more features than traditional jobs 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.360
 such as the apple dock for 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.490
 iphone or other devices 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.800
 it once has a micro-usb connection 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.720
 the whole thing to the pc or to the stream 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.120
 connect a sound output around 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.729
 a play music or similar 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.220
 normal hdmi connection to this later more 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.410
 three whole usb connections and to 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.780
 finalize a micro-usb connection 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.760
 a device stuck on the dock like 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.229
 just mentioned there is a hdmi 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.090
 connection and that is convenient 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.290
 there for the screen of the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.160
 smartphones on a monitor 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.440
 show 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.619
 that's how I think a really cool 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.110
 bauble and it's always fun 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.670
 to watch movies and yes it is easy 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.570
 hot 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.490
 There are also the three here 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.410
 USB ports are also very convenient 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.420
 are there you can then usb sticks 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.170
 put in it and that works 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.450
 pretty good 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.700
 Finally, there is a very good one 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.590
 function allows you to many 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.820
 devices with the dock can use 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.830
 she is at the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.259
 micro-usb connection because that is 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.320
 mobile and not solid as well 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.420
 It therefore still a bar after the man 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.430
 come down press what is the purpose 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.180
 if the connection of the device 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.030
 further down is or ends to 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.920
 for example, if you have a case or 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.260
 similar that one again that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.769
 Smartphone still stuck in the docks 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.480
 Can use to use the dock too 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.000
 can you need of course, first the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.130
 supplied usb cable that one then in 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.320
 put the docks then put the other one 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.870
 end of the cable either in the power supply 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.640
 or to the computer and close that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.350
 power supply then the power 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.000
 and to the conclusion you have then your 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.580
 gets into the docks stuck in my 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.500
 case is the samsung galaxy s3 in blue 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.870
 after that opens on the smartphone 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.180
 a window that only opens when the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.459
 doc is also connected to the stream around 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.440
 you have to use the hdmi function 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.019
 Of course, that's the first thing about the micro 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.019
 connect the USB cable to the power supply 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.730
 then you need a hdmi cable and 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.530
 of course a monitor 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.019
 if you shut that off you hdmi 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.120
 cable to the dock and on the other 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.160
 side to the tv or the monitor 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.590
 then you put the smartphone in the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.080
 job and you can already use the smartphone 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.760
 s.den monitor see if you then the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.709
 sleep button is pressed 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.170
 screen automatically has one too 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.569
 no connection anymore usb sticks or 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.209
 other storage devices also via usb 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.780
 Run only when the dock 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.090
 the current device gives enough power 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.890
 conclusion that samsung multimedia dock is 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.690
 just a really useful one 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.580
 and it is also legally helpful 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.739
 is very well built meets his 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.450
 purpose and has a good stand it has 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.280
 many functions such as the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.480
 Display from the smartphone on a monitor 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.599
 show 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.549
 connect usb sticks and so on for 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.829
 a price of just under 50 euros is everything 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.260
 delivered with what you need it is 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.250
 totally recommended so that's it 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.319

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.959
