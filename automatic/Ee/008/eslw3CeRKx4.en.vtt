00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
actually a target on to these balloons

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.740 
actually a target on to these balloons
here<00:04:16.320> creating<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:16.950> very<00:04:17.220> dangerous<00:04:17.630> point<00:04:18.630> in

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
here creating a very dangerous point in

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.969 
here creating a very dangerous point in
the<00:04:18.870> raid<00:04:19.049> right<00:04:19.260> now<00:04:19.410> because<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.739> wizard

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
the raid right now because that wizard

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.259 
the raid right now because that wizard
tower<00:04:20.100> could<00:04:20.280> easily<00:04:20.580> take<00:04:20.729> out<00:04:20.910> all<00:04:21.120> these

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
tower could easily take out all these

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.830 
tower could easily take out all these
puppies<00:04:21.660> but<00:04:22.350> just<00:04:23.160> just<00:04:24.000> enough<00:04:24.360> hit<00:04:24.510> points

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
puppies but just just enough hit points

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.020 
puppies but just just enough hit points
left<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.380> all<00:04:25.590> those<00:04:25.770> balloons<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.490> actually

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
left on all those balloons to actually

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.730 
left on all those balloons to actually
kill<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.330> wizard<00:04:27.660> tower<00:04:27.900> with<00:04:28.229> their<00:04:28.410> splash

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
kill the wizard tower with their splash

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.920 
kill the wizard tower with their splash
damage<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.729> can<00:04:29.880> see<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.120> it's<00:04:30.630> going<00:04:30.840> to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
damage so you can see that it's going to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.780 
damage so you can see that it's going to
be<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.140> three-star<00:04:31.620> attack<00:04:31.919> once<00:04:32.430> again

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
attacks using non max heroes and my

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.460 
attacks using non max heroes and my
question<00:04:56.789> my<00:04:57.300> answer<00:04:57.479> is<00:04:57.780> always<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.020> same<00:04:58.110> as

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
question my answer is always the same as

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.900 
question my answer is always the same as
it<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.620> with<00:04:58.830> every<00:04:59.039> strategy<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.669> it<00:04:59.759> really

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
it is with every strategy and it really

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.360 
it is with every strategy and it really
depends<00:05:00.449> on<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:01.410> level<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.889> base<00:05:02.099> that<00:05:02.280> you're

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
depends on the level of base that you're

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.430 
depends on the level of base that you're
going<00:05:02.669> against<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.300> would<00:05:03.900> not<00:05:04.080> advise

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
going against so I would not advise

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.129 
going against so I would not advise
tackling<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.280> max<00:05:05.550> base<00:05:05.880> with<00:05:06.270> non<00:05:06.479> max<00:05:06.780> heroes

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
tackling a max base with non max heroes

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.809 
tackling a max base with non max heroes
but<00:05:07.680> if<00:05:07.740> you're<00:05:07.919> attacking<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.280> base<00:05:08.430> like<00:05:08.610> this

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
but if you're attacking a base like this

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.939 
but if you're attacking a base like this
you<00:05:09.060> can<00:05:09.180> see<00:05:09.360> it's<00:05:09.479> a<00:05:09.630> relatively<00:05:10.080> newer<00:05:10.530> Town

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
you can see it's a relatively newer Town

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.999 
you can see it's a relatively newer Town
Hall<00:05:11.190> 10<00:05:11.720> it's<00:05:12.720> fine<00:05:12.930> going<00:05:13.289> in<00:05:13.440> with<00:05:13.590> non<00:05:13.740> max
