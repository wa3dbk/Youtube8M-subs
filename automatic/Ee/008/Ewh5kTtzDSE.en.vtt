were $25 they have a gamete seal lid and
I'm<00:00:51.340> gonna<00:00:51.460> open<00:00:54.630> now<00:00:55.630> you<00:00:55.989> can<00:00:56.530> see<00:00:56.770> I<00:00:57.100> mean<00:00:57.340> it

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
I'm gonna open now you can see I mean it

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.060 
I'm gonna open now you can see I mean it
comes<00:00:57.700> with<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.940> little<00:00:58.180> scoop<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.800> comes

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
comes with a little scoop to it comes

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.580 
comes with a little scoop to it comes
with<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.280> scooper<00:01:00.760> which<00:01:00.970> is<00:01:01.120> kinda<00:01:01.329> nice<00:01:01.590> but

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
with a scooper which is kinda nice but

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.770 
with a scooper which is kinda nice but
it<00:01:02.860> says<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.130> it<00:01:03.460> will<00:01:03.550> hold<00:01:03.730> 60<00:01:04.239> pounds<00:01:04.629> if

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
it says that it will hold 60 pounds if

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.569 
it says that it will hold 60 pounds if
there<00:01:04.930> are<00:01:05.019> 75<00:01:05.560> pounds<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.040> sugar<00:01:06.189> in<00:01:06.340> there

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
there are 75 pounds of sugar in there

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:07.200 
there are 75 pounds of sugar in there
right<00:01:06.759> now

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
right now

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.190 
right now
now<00:01:08.200> if<00:01:08.560> you<00:01:08.799> stack<00:01:09.100> them<00:01:09.659> coming<00:01:10.659> this<00:01:10.900> way

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
now if you stack them coming this way

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.170 
now if you stack them coming this way
they<00:01:11.680> can<00:01:11.830> stack<00:01:12.070> up<00:01:12.250> on<00:01:12.370> top<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.700> each<00:01:12.909> other

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
they can stack up on top of each other

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.230 
they can stack up on top of each other
and<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:14.080> would<00:01:14.440> be<00:01:14.860> harder<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.340> load<00:01:15.820> because

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
and it would be harder to load because

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.740 
and it would be harder to load because
this<00:01:16.840> part<00:01:17.530> would<00:01:17.830> be<00:01:18.040> down<00:01:18.580> here<00:01:18.610> pointing<00:01:19.570> up

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
this part would be down here pointing up

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.530 
this part would be down here pointing up
if<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.320> makes<00:01:20.560> sense<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.670> so<00:01:22.210> I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
if that makes sense to you and so I

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.620 
if that makes sense to you and so I
don't<00:01:23.049> know<00:01:23.260> how<00:01:23.470> easy<00:01:23.799> that<00:01:23.950> would<00:01:24.159> work

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
don't know how easy that would work

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.410 
don't know how easy that would work
I<00:01:25.659> didn't<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.500> try<00:01:26.680> well<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.400> started<00:01:27.909> out<00:01:28.180> like

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
I didn't I try well I started out like

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.030 
I didn't I try well I started out like
that<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.930> thought<00:01:29.110> it'd<00:01:29.290> be<00:01:29.320> hard<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.799> load

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
that and I thought it'd be hard to load

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.430 
that and I thought it'd be hard to load
up<00:01:30.250> your<00:01:30.610> stuff<00:01:31.330> would<00:01:31.510> be<00:01:31.630> at<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:31.750> slant<00:01:32.080> so<00:01:32.380> you

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
up your stuff would be at a slant so you

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.840 
up your stuff would be at a slant so you
could<00:01:32.650> never<00:01:32.799> fill<00:01:33.159> it<00:01:33.310> all<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.640> way<00:01:33.790> but

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
could never fill it all the way but

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
could never fill it all the way but
these<00:01:34.180> are<00:01:34.390> airtight<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:37.689> just<00:01:37.750> put

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
these are airtight and this I just put

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.789 
these are airtight and this I just put
50<00:01:41.140> pounds<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.530> flour<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:42.159> here<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.299> I<00:01:43.799> would

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
50 pounds of flour in here so I would

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.520 
50 pounds of flour in here so I would
guess<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.400> will<00:01:45.580> easily<00:01:46.210> I<00:01:46.299> mean<00:01:46.450> Italy<00:01:47.229> hold

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
guess this will easily I mean Italy hold

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.640 
guess this will easily I mean Italy hold
75<00:01:47.920> pounds<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.400> flour<00:01:48.580> but<00:01:49.200> dog<00:01:50.200> food

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
75 pounds of flour but dog food

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.890 
75 pounds of flour but dog food
something<00:01:51.159> like<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.580> yeah<00:01:51.970> probably<00:01:52.330> only

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
something like that yeah probably only

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.300 
something like that yeah probably only
60<00:01:53.350> pounds<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.860> says<00:01:54.100> 60<00:01:54.640> but<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:56.590> consider

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
60 pounds it says 60 but I was consider

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.360 
60 pounds it says 60 but I was consider
if<00:01:57.520> he's<00:01:57.700> got<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.090> extra<00:01:58.420> money

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
if he's got the extra money

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.740 
if he's got the extra money
these<00:02:01.370> are<00:02:01.550> pretty<00:02:01.700> versatile<00:02:02.180> they're

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
these are pretty versatile they're

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.310 
these are pretty versatile they're
really<00:02:02.960> tough<00:02:03.260> they<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.850> think<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.930> still

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
really tough they I think that still

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.850 
really tough they I think that still
keep<00:02:06.620> my<00:02:06.650> stuff<00:02:07.100> airtight<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.619> yes

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
keep my stuff airtight and yes

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.530 
keep my stuff airtight and yes
I'm<00:02:09.950> really<00:02:10.340> happy<00:02:10.700> with<00:02:10.820> him<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.240> just<00:02:11.450> thought

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
I'm really happy with him I just thought

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.710 
I'm really happy with him I just thought
I'd<00:02:11.690> do<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> review<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.610> know<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.790> waited<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.570> long

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
I'd do a review you know I waited a long

time<00:02:14.780> for<00:02:15.080> these<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.470> saw<00:02:15.800> him<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> couple<00:02:16.010> years

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
time for these I saw him a couple years

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.160 
time for these I saw him a couple years
ago<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.090> thought<00:02:17.300> here<00:02:17.600> they're<00:02:17.900> too<00:02:18.050> much

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
ago and I thought here they're too much

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.120 
ago and I thought here they're too much
money<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.300> truly<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:21.080> want<00:02:22.070> to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
money but really and truly I want to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.990 
money but really and truly I want to
throw<00:02:22.370> out<00:02:22.550> food<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:23.650> if<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:25.100> buy<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.430> now

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
throw out food so if I can buy it now

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.720 
throw out food so if I can buy it now
while<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:26.690> cheaper<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.590> keep<00:02:28.280> it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
while it's cheaper and keep it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.120
