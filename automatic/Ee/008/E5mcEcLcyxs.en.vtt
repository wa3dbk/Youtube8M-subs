00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.000
 evaluation after the presentation of the 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.180
 result of the resonance 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.770
 today but he did a muscle injury he is 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.190
 the proven entrepreneur starting 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.350
 in that one is a form of god that the 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.230
 return to normal work forecast 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.449
 of 400 years is a region the time 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.539
 reasonable recovery time for the 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.369
 of normal muscle damage, what is there is 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.020
 location by the size of the lesion 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.720
 people are giving this period of four 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.600
 weeks jd twitter is a reasonable time frame 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.670
 as a total block on the basis of problems 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.140
 on material to both knees 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.870
 he did a reinforcement job 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.610
 thigh muscle and got worse if I 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.890
 win just correct me this job now 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.280
 be reattached shall have served otherwise 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.300
 it's not going to work there's another problem 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.190
 muscular other leg part except 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.870
 of that region considering that thigh 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.150
 I think it's going to work normally 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.520
 from tomorrow probably 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.680
 during the morning by the factor that is most 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.270
 taking time out of an injury to the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.320
 knee is practically a year without playing 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.220
 soccer 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.680
 may have been a forcing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.020
 I seek differentiated training in muscle 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.760
 recovery from knee injury 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 I do not think there's any relation to it 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.490
 was released to the great works 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 normal 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.690
 He is a sprinter. People know this and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 this can happen in any game 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.040
 even if not related to us 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.430
 let's change horizon 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.190
 this injury in the possession of a human being 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.290
 something natural a pre-season 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.150
 or she's just looking for 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.970
 differentiated pre-season that the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.340
 made this year a competition soon in the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.619
 start and then I went through a sequence of 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 long trips helps you follow 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.540
 football has already had this injury until in pre- 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.390
 season we go out can happen 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.660
 at any moment you can not explain 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.280
 what is the kind of work that 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.590
 unfortunately we do not 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.830
 Expect me to be my partner. 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.320
 It's sad, right, and it looks like it was catching on. 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.750
 pace of play beginning to blend into the 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.090
 players in that year when this injury is 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.940
 unfortunately but now I'm waiting 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.160
 to do as fast as possible already 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.100
 I have gone from much worse problems 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.500
 here you will not mess up on my 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.030
 career where the injury was felt to be 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.910
 thought it would be more or less that 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.570
 time to stand still but I already had this 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.710
 type of injury already four years 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.120
 I played here the pain is the same is similar 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.480
 at the time I knew it had happened 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.340
 something does not know the gravity 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 I thought it might be a little less than 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.970
 which was already could have been another one 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.940
 channel 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.120
 The term itabom I hope it can release 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.890
 but now it's psychologically more 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.040
 calm for those who have suffered injuries 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.590
 much more serious than it seems in 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 pool but on the other hand it's a bad guess 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.390
 that returning to my two injuries 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.370
 knee and now it's dropping me so much more 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.260
 more pace of play and already has this injury 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.870
 interrupts from noah 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.660
 It's sad but it's part of football when 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.660
 the will of the subject to happen
