00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.760
 next we look at installing hard 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:13.160
 drive and connect it 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.369
 motherboard here we have a hard disk 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:23.029
 western digital 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:25.980
 form factor connect go 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:31.880
 connector interface 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.880
 cable and times and place to connect 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.880
 power supply 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.270
 the housing has a seat for 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:57.120
 hard drive installation 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.120
 here it is covered here with a saber and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 we twist 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:33.250
 hard drive bolted with two 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:38.829
 parties so we started and took off 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 the body two covers twisted with one 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.909
 side of this come in my group 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.909
 parties 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.610
 then 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:25.340
 did not go anywhere to connect 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.820
 motherboard 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.630
 used wide 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:40.560
 cable gi connecting motherboard 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:47.340
 its too hard to confuse because 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.640
 the connector itself has made some 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.640
 ledges 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:03.269
 exactly the same notches 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.319
 there are both on the hard disk and in place 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.890
 connect the motherboard here is the place 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:17.989
 to connect a motherboard such 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.989
 wide and then over there to connect 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.670
 Chile 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:42.319
 there is also a small tip on the train 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:45.810
 there is one red wire this wire 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:51.959
 should be when connected hard 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:56.810
 drive is facing the power connector on 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.810
 hard drive that is like this 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:12.970
 put an extra right ahead of time 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:16.290
 they do not interfere with the interface 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.290
 on hooked up 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.290
 Now we connect the power 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.800
 power cable for connection 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.800
 Russian disco here and so looks 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.310
 and it connects too hard to confuse 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:51.270
 because his form is specially what not 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.270
 confuse 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.880
 On this 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.260
 installation and connection of a hard disk 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
 completed
