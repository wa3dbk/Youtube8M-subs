00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
side today we're talking about bracing

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.440 
side today we're talking about bracing
Corin<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.870> spine<00:00:04.529> so<00:00:05.339> it's<00:00:05.819> really<00:00:06.029> important

Corin and spine so it's really important
to<00:00:06.509> know<00:00:06.629> how<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:06.960> these<00:00:07.109> for<00:00:07.919> us<00:00:08.189> because

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
to know how to do these for us because

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.850 
to know how to do these for us because
we're<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.790> gym<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.809> deadlift<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.530> squat

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
we're in the gym we deadlift we squat

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.980 
we're in the gym we deadlift we squat
and<00:00:11.250> press<00:00:11.460> things<00:00:11.730> over<00:00:12.030> our<00:00:12.150> head<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.809> we

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and press things over our head and we

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.369 
and press things over our head and we
need<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> know<00:00:13.559> how<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:13.980> race<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.170> can

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
need to know how to race so that we can

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.000 
need to know how to race so that we can
prevent<00:00:16.619> injury<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> also<00:00:18.090> perform<00:00:18.660> better

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
prevent injury and also perform better

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.730 
prevent injury and also perform better
so<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:21.060> important<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.630> things<00:00:22.350> outside<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
so is it important for things outside of

positions so the whole reason we're

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
positions so the whole reason we're
bracing<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> spine<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.250> are

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430

so there's some really easy quick tips
to<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.160> fixing<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.820> problems<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to go about fixing these problems and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.430 
to go about fixing these problems and
learning<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> brace<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.190> first<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
learning how to brace so first one is

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.799 
learning how to brace so first one is
engaging<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.739> glutes<00:01:02.120> now<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.539> back

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
engaging the glutes now you can go back

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
engaging the glutes now you can go back
and<00:01:03.989> look<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.530> whole<00:01:04.920> bunch<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> other

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and look at a whole bunch of other

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.280 
and look at a whole bunch of other
videos<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:06.030> ours<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.479> always<00:01:06.750> talk<00:01:06.930> about<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
videos of ours we always talk about the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.640 
videos of ours we always talk about the
glutes

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
glutes

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.000 
glutes
they<00:01:08.750> basically<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.200> point<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> engaging<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
they basically the point of engaging the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.429 
they basically the point of engaging the
glutes<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.970> pulls<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.750> pulls<00:01:13.170> us<00:01:13.290> out

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
glutes is that pulls up pulls us out

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
glutes is that pulls up pulls us out
over<00:01:13.590> extension<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.360> bra

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
over extension so we don't get this bra

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.240 
over extension so we don't get this bra
brownlow<00:01:16.290> back<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.030> also<00:01:18.350> our<00:01:19.350> glutes<00:01:19.920> our

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
brownlow back and also our glutes our

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.880 
brownlow back and also our glutes our
most<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.600> weight-bearing<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
most are much more weight-bearing you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
most are much more weight-bearing you
know<00:01:23.100> our<00:01:23.220> hips<00:01:23.520> than<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.330> spine<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.350> we

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
know our hips than our spine so when we

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.350 
know our hips than our spine so when we
go<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> lift<00:01:25.979> something<00:01:26.310> off<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> floor<00:01:26.850> it's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
go to lift something off the floor it's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
go to lift something off the floor it's
these<00:01:27.659> muscles<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.770> pulling<00:01:28.979> us

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
these muscles that are pulling us

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.999 
these muscles that are pulling us
upright<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.939> our<00:01:30.119> back<00:01:30.270> muscles<00:01:30.299> okay<00:01:31.229> very

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
upright not our back muscles okay very

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.999 
upright not our back muscles okay very
important<00:01:32.600> for<00:01:33.600> basically<00:01:33.990> overall<00:01:34.710> health

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
important for basically overall health

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.600 
important for basically overall health
and<00:01:35.189> also<00:01:35.310> performance<00:01:35.909> second<00:01:37.310> we're<00:01:38.310> trying

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and also performance second we're trying

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.740 
and also performance second we're trying
to<00:01:38.700> prevent<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:39.869> happening<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.750> what

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to prevent this from happening so what

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
to prevent this from happening so what
we're<00:01:42.869> gonna<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.680> pull<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> shoulder

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
we're gonna do is pull the shoulder

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
we're gonna do is pull the shoulder
blades<00:01:44.340> down<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.200> pull<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> ribs

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
blades down and back and pull the ribs

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.850 
blades down and back and pull the ribs
down<00:01:47.280> straight<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> floor

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.280 

okay<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.369> we're<00:01:55.090> not<00:01:55.240> getting<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.020> we're

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
okay so we're not getting this and we're
