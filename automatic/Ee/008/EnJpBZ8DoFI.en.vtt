00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello how welcome are you to reality 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.730
 paranormal 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.680
 this is a short video where they 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.279
 will warn about supposed evidence 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.920
 UFO that within these days will present 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.350
 a Mexican settler inside his channel 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 youtube but before that happens 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.099
 I want to present the opinion of my 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.859
 research team that conducted the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.449
 analysis of that video my name is the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.449
 Castro we started 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.410
 do not tell me 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.390
 yesterday, super one of my 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.580
 comrades warned me about an evidence 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.190
 UFO that they had presented on television 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.980
 and which at first glance I could know 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.460
 what it was about next 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.460
 original video 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 web 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.200
 do not 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.030
 all right 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.000
 it is said that the video was obtained by 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.760
 a girl of 12 years in ohio usa in the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.520
 video we can see an ovoid shape with 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.880
 the extensions up down and in one of 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.880
 its sides 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.870
 and 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.680
 by instability of filming not 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.260
 we can clearly see the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.270
 actual movement of the object but 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.270
 we get to see some reflections of the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.410
 sun on its surface and it makes us see a 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.410
 metallic texture 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.129
 however my partner super what 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.100
 identified as a balloon to control in 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.410
 shark shape 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.520
 on that basis we gave ourselves to the task of 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.520
 compare objects 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.470
 my partner iron garcÃ­a presents us 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.170
 this image to compare the global 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.290
 control and the supposed UFO 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.959
 as we see is very similar and the one that does not 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.930
 see the fins in the image of the part 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.420
 superior is for the blur and the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.150
 distance from the affirmation in these 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.520
 images we can clearly see that 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.520
 it is effectively the same design 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.020
 this frame is very important 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.140
 since we can see a reddish color 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.849
 at the tip of the object and if we go to 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.980
 the reference of the globe 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.830
 we discovered that he also has that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.050
 red color at the tip and that is the 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.050
 drawing of shark mouth 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.240
 in this overlay we can see that no 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.220
 there is doubt the same object seems to 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.180
 next we will see a shark balloon in 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.609
 action compared to the supposed UFO 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.880
 so that you yourselves have your own 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.880
 criterion 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.190
 for my research team and for 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.220
 a server is clear that it would be about 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.039
 a shark balloon I find it curious that 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.960
 with this already be three flying animals 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.900
 within the investigations of this one 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.410
 Mexican forum remember your successes 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.979
 past that would be the flying horse and 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:40.009
 the famous flying penguin in this 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.530
 case will present this video as a UFO 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:45.680
 that in reality it would be a 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:50.259
 flying shark my name is Castro Island 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.259
 we will continue investigating until next time 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.550
 schleck 

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.459
 transmitting 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.680
 I 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.680
 or not
