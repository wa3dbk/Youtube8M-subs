and then I'll get the studio lights in

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.580 
and then I'll get the studio lights in
the<00:04:32.979> way<00:04:33.130> on<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.479> we<00:04:34.630> brought<00:04:34.870> over<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.349> this

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
the way on that we brought over to this

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.020 
the way on that we brought over to this
side<00:04:35.860> which<00:04:36.099> looks<00:04:36.340> exactly<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.970> same

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
side which looks exactly the same

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.059 
side which looks exactly the same
without<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.720> switch<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.560> bottom<00:04:38.889> has

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
without the switch but the bottom has

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.670 
without the switch but the bottom has
the<00:04:39.280> microphone<00:04:39.840> microphone<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.259> headphone

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
the microphone microphone the headphone

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.210 
the microphone microphone the headphone
input<00:04:41.949> but<00:04:42.849> this<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.240> where<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:44.220> batteries

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
input but this is where the batteries

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.420 
input but this is where the batteries
are<00:04:45.460> stored<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.349> device<00:04:47.380> so<00:04:47.919> basically

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
are stored on the device so basically

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.550 
are stored on the device so basically
all<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.729> do<00:04:48.910> is<00:04:49.090> give<00:04:49.509> it<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:49.720> quick<00:04:49.960> little<00:04:50.229> I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
all you do is give it a quick little I

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.850 
all you do is give it a quick little I
mean<00:04:51.550> all<00:04:51.669> sixteenth<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:52.509> twist<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:53.620> feel

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
mean all sixteenth of a twist you feel

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.219 
mean all sixteenth of a twist you feel
unclick<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:54.880> then<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:55.479> just<00:04:55.630> pick<00:04:55.870> out<00:04:55.990> this

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
unclick and then you just pick out this

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.589 
unclick and then you just pick out this
or<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.560> can<00:04:56.680> tip<00:04:56.889> it<00:04:57.039> and<00:04:57.250> these<00:04:57.880> are<00:04:57.940> active

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
or you can tip it and these are active

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.800 
or you can tip it and these are active
noise<00:04:58.900> cancellation<00:04:59.500> but<00:05:00.430> they<00:05:01.150> rely<00:05:01.539> on

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
noise cancellation but they rely on

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.890 
noise cancellation but they rely on
battery<00:05:02.199> power<00:05:02.229> to<00:05:02.710> actually<00:05:03.599> let<00:05:04.599> you<00:05:04.720> listen

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
battery power to actually let you listen

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.010 
battery power to actually let you listen
to<00:05:05.080> music<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:06.220> that<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:06.669> one<00:05:06.909> downfall<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:07.750> far

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
to music so that is one downfall so far

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.740 
to music so that is one downfall so far
but<00:05:08.560> we'll<00:05:09.370> have<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.550> see<00:05:09.669> exactly<00:05:09.940> how<00:05:10.449> long

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
but we'll have to see exactly how long

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.689 
but we'll have to see exactly how long
these<00:05:10.960> last<00:05:11.319> on<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.620> pair<00:05:11.919> of<00:05:12.069> triple-a

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
these last on a pair of triple-a

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.559 
these last on a pair of triple-a
batteries<00:05:13.150> so<00:05:13.650> just<00:05:14.650> clip<00:05:14.889> that<00:05:15.069> up<00:05:15.449> let's<00:05:16.449> get

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
batteries so just clip that up let's get

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.300 
batteries so just clip that up let's get
on<00:05:16.720> to<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:16.930> earcups<00:05:17.440> real<00:05:17.800> quick<00:05:18.039> they<00:05:18.280> are

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
on to the earcups real quick they are

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.010 
on to the earcups real quick they are
soft<00:05:18.960> soft<00:05:19.960> soft<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:21.580> just<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.150> just<00:05:22.419> learned

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
soft soft soft I just I just learned

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.899 
soft soft soft I just I just learned
just<00:05:23.440> soft<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.990> headband<00:05:26.500> is<00:05:26.909> relatively

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
just soft and the headband is relatively

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.779 
just soft and the headband is relatively
soft<00:05:28.389> it<00:05:28.720> has<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.110> little<00:05:29.380> bit<00:05:29.560> of<00:05:29.789> resilience

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
soft it has a little bit of resilience

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.600 
soft it has a little bit of resilience
to<00:05:31.030> it<00:05:31.180> but<00:05:31.449> I<00:05:31.750> think<00:05:32.740> that's<00:05:32.889> actually<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.400> good

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
to it but I think that's actually a good

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.310 
to it but I think that's actually a good
thing<00:05:33.669> because<00:05:34.449> you<00:05:34.750> don't<00:05:34.900> want<00:05:35.020> your<00:05:35.110> head

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
thing because you don't want your head

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.709 
thing because you don't want your head
