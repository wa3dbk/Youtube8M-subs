00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
look look so actually it takes a lot of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.280 
look look so actually it takes a lot of
force<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> take<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> off<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:37.110> have

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
bottom right here to take it off you can

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639 
bottom right here to take it off you can
actually<00:01:41.549> hear<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> noises<00:01:42.200> how<00:01:43.200> long<00:01:43.409> how

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
actually hear the noises how long how

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.929 
actually hear the noises how long how
how<00:01:44.130> strong<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> suction<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.520> i<00:01:47.640> clamp

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
how strong the suction is and if i clamp

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.109 
how strong the suction is and if i clamp
it<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:49.460> there's<00:01:50.460> no<00:01:50.579> way<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> coming

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it down there's no way this is coming

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.320 
it down there's no way this is coming
off<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.600> pretty<00:01:51.810> tough

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330 

so<00:01:58.330> really<00:01:58.690> really<00:01:59.050> strong<00:01:59.290> no<00:01:59.800> surprises

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
so really really strong no surprises

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.040 
so really really strong no surprises
patency<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.940> really<00:02:01.180> strong<00:02:01.390> suction<00:02:01.690> and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
patency is a really strong suction and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.470 
patency is a really strong suction and
you<00:02:03.040> have<00:02:03.190> your<00:02:03.340> little<00:02:03.520> rotation<00:02:03.880> dog<00:02:04.240> right
