00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
I thought this was

I thought this was
shorter<00:02:09.800> but<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.460> a<00:02:10.490> perfect<00:02:11.360> length

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
shorter but this is a perfect length

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.410 
shorter but this is a perfect length
because<00:02:12.260> they<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.190> mean<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.640> looks<00:02:13.820> bigger<00:02:14.180> than

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
because they I mean it looks bigger than
