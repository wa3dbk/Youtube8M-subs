00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:12.200
 Here we put the workpiece now on the table 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:17.550
 turn on the button and the machine stand in work 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.539
 we take a wooden clamp homemade he 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.560
 lightly on the grater 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 paraffin in order to better slid 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:37.129
 on the tape and press down to evenly and his 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:42.170
 in preparation and always 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:47.750
 we move the table to the benefit of you on the rollers and 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.750
 moves rides easily enough 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.910
 move it to tape 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.910
 I did not cut the billet with my edges 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.850
 otherwise she spoils us all 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.880
 and so we move the clamp and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.820
 move the trunk back to 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.240
 the result is a very polishing 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:24.920
 quality is much easier and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:30.110
 faster and cheaper than 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:35.420
 my manual sander for the reason that 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.510
 Firstly, the tape area is much larger. 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.070
 than a scientific grinder 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:47.500
 plus there each tape is worth the money and 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:53.300
 here you just need to buy 5 meters 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:59.990
 sandpaper cut it to width 10 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:06.550
 centimeters and glue the tape 88 glue 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.550
 ring and all please blind 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.820
 plus 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.930
 there is nothing to break in relation to 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.930
 compared to the grinder 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.470
 therefore each therefore and 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.460
 the cost of polishing us 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.460
 irisha 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.640
 Now you see how the dust flies under 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.190
 drummer idea 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.510
 snail fan catches 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.660
 this is the final part of her flies roma but 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.319
 no machine works buy about a hundred 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.319
 percent
