00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.130
 750 cc and a motorcycle born in these 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 last times 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.410
 and the walls 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.260
 official on this circuit 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.510
 specialty two laps at the end 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.890
 dad giancarlo 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:27.070
 jesi ancona supported by many fans 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.470
 present here at the santamonica faces 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.470
 this his final 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.260
 and it seems to us that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.550
 accounts are not able to shorten the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.960
 albeit small distance 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.000
 and it looks like it 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.210
 tread you see that comments authority 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 appears on the last curves 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.450
 in this santa circuit 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.990
 the project 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.990
 I do not know 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.010
 the championship races of 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.410
 in Italy 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.270
 among the Italians but also valuable for 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.219
 the lever among young bikers 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.219
 often napolano this 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.130
 remember the traditions of the motorcyclist 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.210
 or not a round at the end always in 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.130
 head but lamp carlo 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.979
 of bimota later by mountains of ducats 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.980
 while he definitely lost ground tar 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.130
 totti 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.360
 he has lost his riding guide at this time 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.690
 the ranking of the Italian championship 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.300
 followed by tardozzi and then we'll see the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.430
 position of falappa to which it remains 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.010
 always the fastest lap established though 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.750
 the 25th lap ie a few moments ago 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.090
 at 153 km average 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.330
 the runners are about to arrive on 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.180
 the goal and the gait of falappa is 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.870
 increasingly authoritative, ever more decisive 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.770
 does not give up mountains but is forced to 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.770
 to stalk 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.770
 here he is a baby bird that double an opponent 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 the mount attack 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.320
 but it is not surprising fall fall i 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.880
 monti it seemed to us to get a little long 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.880
 and was forced to suffer 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.910
 here we see the reinforcement 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.930
 the position of worlds 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.170
 still worlds in the foreground 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.709
 and here we are 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.090
 dad who wins this first run e 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.260
 of the third round of the championship 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.700
 Italian superbike formula is al 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.040
 second place mounts to the third tardozzi 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.549
 monti was posted at 304 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.220
 cents gave up gave in 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.780
 final now let's review the replay is 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.520
 the last sprint 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.740
 he relented I told you in the last laps 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.750
 tar totti that after heeled he sees 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.750
 about 23 laps of the race
