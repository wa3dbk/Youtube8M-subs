00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
the ceiling and we used a popcorn spray

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
the ceiling and we used a popcorn spray
when<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.079> did<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.559> found<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.059> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
when we did that we found that the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.990 
when we did that we found that the
contractor<00:00:42.870> shot<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> original<00:00:44.040> popcorn

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
contractor shot the original popcorn

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.440 
contractor shot the original popcorn
without<00:00:45.210> cleaning<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.410> drywall<00:00:47.180> that's<00:00:48.180> fine

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
without cleaning the drywall that's fine

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.000 
without cleaning the drywall that's fine
if<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.840> nothing<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.500> afterwards

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
if you have nothing to do afterwards

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.959 
if you have nothing to do afterwards
it's<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:51.000> fine<00:00:51.390> though<00:00:51.660> actually<00:00:52.969> because

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it's not fine though actually because

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.139 
it's not fine though actually because
when<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.360> sprayed<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> popcorn<00:00:55.940> another<00:00:56.940> area

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
when we sprayed the popcorn another area

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.500 
when we sprayed the popcorn another area
came<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:58.280> that's<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.969> applied

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
came down that's because they applied

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.060 
came down that's because they applied
the<00:01:00.739> popcorn<00:01:02.120> over<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> dusty<00:01:03.899> dirty<00:01:04.409> drywall

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the popcorn over a dusty dirty drywall

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.260 
the popcorn over a dusty dirty drywall
so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> used<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.700> different<00:01:09.060> type<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so I used a different type of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
so I used a different type of
application<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> popcorn<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.220> blend<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
application for the popcorn to blend it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
application for the popcorn to blend it
in<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:14.360> there's<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.080> roll<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in and there's no way we can roll the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.789 
in and there's no way we can roll the
paint<00:01:16.920> without<00:01:18.020> sections<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> popcorn

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
paint without sections of the popcorn

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.300 
paint without sections of the popcorn
ceiling<00:01:20.009> coming<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:21.380> risking<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
ceiling coming off or risking that so I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
ceiling coming off or risking that so I
taped<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> walls<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.330> plastic<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.140> known
