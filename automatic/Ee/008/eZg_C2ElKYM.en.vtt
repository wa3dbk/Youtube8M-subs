00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
as well but mostly I just really wanted

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.160 
as well but mostly I just really wanted
to<00:00:16.379> test<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.090> post<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:18.840> stuff<00:00:18.960> on

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to test it just to post some stuff on

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.160 
to test it just to post some stuff on
the<00:00:19.289> channel<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.880> that'll<00:00:20.880> be<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.060> soon<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.810> um

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the channel so that'll be up soon but um

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.810 
the channel so that'll be up soon but um
I<00:00:23.420> was<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> test<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:26.099> lens<00:00:26.400> but

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
I was about to test it on this lens but

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.900 
I was about to test it on this lens but
I<00:00:26.849> couldn't<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.859> ringer<00:00:29.189> need<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
I couldn't because the ringer need to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.049 
I couldn't because the ringer need to
test<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.130> adapter<00:00:32.790> ring<00:00:32.940> was

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
test it with this this adapter ring was

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.840 
test it with this this adapter ring was
stuck<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.440> CPL<00:00:34.920> filter<00:00:35.130> by<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.670> way<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
stuck on this CPL filter by the way I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.790 
stuck on this CPL filter by the way I
use<00:00:36.680> 77<00:00:37.680> millimeter<00:00:38.010> Cpl<00:00:38.809> some<00:00:39.809> 77<00:00:40.469> millimeter

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
use 77 millimeter Cpl some 77 millimeter

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.060 
use 77 millimeter Cpl some 77 millimeter
filters<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:42.059> everything<00:00:42.719> most<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.710> my<00:00:43.739> round

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
filters for everything most of my round

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.369 
filters for everything most of my round
filters<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.579> 77<00:00:45.000> millimeter<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.050> they

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
filters and 77 millimeter so that I they

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
filters and 77 millimeter so that I they
can<00:00:46.530> work<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:46.980> lenses<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.969> using

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
can work on all my lenses just using

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.889 
can work on all my lenses just using
these<00:00:48.360> step-up<00:00:48.780> rings<00:00:48.980> or<00:00:49.980> step-down<00:00:50.610> rings

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.910 

but<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.140> stuck<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> tried<00:00:57.859> as<00:00:58.859> hard

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
but it was stuck and so I tried as hard

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.049 
but it was stuck and so I tried as hard
as<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.550> hands<00:00:59.760> my<00:01:00.000> fingers

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
as I could of my hands my fingers

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
as I could of my hands my fingers
whatever<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:01.140> wouldn't<00:01:01.350> work<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.559> tried<00:01:01.770> this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
whatever that wouldn't work I tried this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.340 
whatever that wouldn't work I tried this
jar<00:01:02.550> opener<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.270> mean<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.870> might<00:01:04.170> work

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
jar opener thing I mean that might work

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.640 
jar opener thing I mean that might work
for<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.589> cases<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:07.049> problem

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
for some cases but not here the problem

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.730 
for some cases but not here the problem
was<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.360> because<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.600> plastic<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.380> inner

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
was that because it's plastic this inner

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.210 
was that because it's plastic this inner
ring<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> thread<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
ring the one with the thread on it is

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.929 
ring the one with the thread on it is
plastic<00:01:14.299> this<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.740> here<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:19.220> was<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.759> soon

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
plastic this one here that was as soon

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.160 
plastic this one here that was as soon
as<00:01:21.090> I'm<00:01:21.210> trying<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> press<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.080> my

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
as I'm trying to press it with my

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.460 
as I'm trying to press it with my
fingers<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:23.130> warping<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> plastic<00:01:24.119> allel

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
fingers it's warping the plastic allel

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.499 
fingers it's warping the plastic allel
which<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> creating<00:01:26.040> pressure<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:27.060> against

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
which is creating pressure up against

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.910 
which is creating pressure up against
this<00:01:27.659> metal<00:01:28.229> adapter<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.939> wouldn't

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
this metal adapter and it just wouldn't

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.789 
this metal adapter and it just wouldn't
just<00:01:31.920> could<00:01:32.100> take<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> off<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.880> what<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> did<00:01:36.799> by

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
just could take it off so what it did by

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.249 
just could take it off so what it did by
taking<00:01:38.130> some<00:01:38.280> string<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.790> putting<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
taking some string and putting that

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.010 
taking some string and putting that
around<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> won<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.540> creating

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
around here you won you're not creating

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.940 
around here you won you're not creating
that<00:01:43.460> area<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.670> pressure<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.590> plastic

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that area of pressure on the plastic

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
that area of pressure on the plastic
ring<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.240> pressure<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.780> are

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
ring and to the pressure that you are

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
ring and to the pressure that you are
putting<00:01:49.140> because<00:01:49.500> there's<00:01:49.649> more<00:01:49.770> surface

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
putting because there's more surface

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.139 
putting because there's more surface
area<00:01:50.369> between<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.570> string<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> adapter

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
area between the string and the adapter

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.510 
area between the string and the adapter
there's<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> evens<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
there's a it so it evens out that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
there's a it so it evens out that
pressure<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.140> gets<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.380> grip<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> as

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
pressure and gets a better grip on it as

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.280 
pressure and gets a better grip on it as
well<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.479> basically<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.630> scrap<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.110> like

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
well so basically just scrap it like

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.789 
well so basically just scrap it like
that<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:03.509> will<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> most

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that and that will it's the most

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.670 
that and that will it's the most
effective<00:02:05.250> method<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.579> found<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.780> unscrewing

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
effective method I found for unscrewing

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.390 
effective method I found for unscrewing
a<00:02:07.770> filter<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:11.330> stuff<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.599> that's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
a filter and stuff like this that's

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.339 
a filter and stuff like this that's
stuck<00:02:13.640> together<00:02:13.810> anyways<00:02:14.810> guys<00:02:14.959> hope<00:02:15.230> that

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
stuck together anyways guys hope that
