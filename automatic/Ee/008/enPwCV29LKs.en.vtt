00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:19.039
 and it's a sport scene who speaks 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.130
 today we have here the game fifa 14 of 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.990
 isport the 14th edition of the series of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.359
 games are in doubt by the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.669
 ue and canada games for pc and consoles 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.500
 with various portals for android irs 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.930
 in this new version of fifa justifies the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.760
 physical change of the game players that go 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.890
 choose various ways to shape with 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.270
 Ball coming to us and I 'm going to play 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.469
 different and unique 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.539
 so the game got much less 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.370
 predictable and more exciting I do not see 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.579
 that you can not always predict the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.199
 which the player will execute 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.280
 in this version for android there are two 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.109
 control types 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.370
 the controls to the sides on the screen and 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.140
 classic control 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.179
 I preferred a business because it was more 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 practice for you to use 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.809
 when and by slides on the screen 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.089
 especially here on the tablet screen 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 you need to make larger movements 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.530
 and this ends up hampering a little bit 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.659
 so if you like the covenant is 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.610
 most common to see the classic is an option 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.020
 but you lose this type of content 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.700
 in the dem settings 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.770
 the players did not move anymore 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.990
 near the ball becomes easier 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.100
 to steal and put even you is certain that 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.509
 so when you're playing with 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.560
 great players like the Messi or 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.180
 Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.049
 see you get the ball and neither do the players 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.119
 nor the defender can reach 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.490
 speeds on stealing the ball but off 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.290
 these cases are much more 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.159
 realistic about the stealing game 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.000
 the ball 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.710
 the player runs those things like that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.969
 One thing I also really liked about the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.469
 stationary balls 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.780
 we are not animated by the 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.610
 players hit the miss the goalkeeper is 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.100
 in the belly of things like this 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.469
 You'll get an angle here that goes. 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.969
 appear to you on the screen and slide 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.549
 make the kick according to your 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.560
 slide at the time were not stronger or 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.409
 weaker to make a kick with 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.789
 a deal with 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.670
 What you will do slide on the screen 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.379
 both in the corner and in the fault as 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.599
 in the consoles and pc version 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.340
 the performance of goalkeepers improved them 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.420
 are massages with more reflexes 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.950
 mobility 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.959
 the graphics are very good especially 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.180
 when we talk about the fact that the game 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.700
 has only 1.3 debts and has 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.790
 more than 600 films being 21 brazilians 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.920
 33 books among the most famous 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.590
 Spanish and Italian linked the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.140
 around the world and over 16 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.060
 players then compaction into a 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.870
 great work done by the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.670
 ignis here the narration in English not in 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.190
 Portuguese how not to be twisted to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.319
 as it traverses where the narration made 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.599
 by tiago leifert and caio ribeiro 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.890
 but it's a good quality ration 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.030
 narrator and knew well our 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.099
 players 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.200
 he is very convinced in his lines and 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.970
 has no speech so very strange or 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.829
 a wrong thing such 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.870
 so it's cool, it 's a shame it does not have 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.310
 future we do not know the sex will 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.079
 launch an update that brings a 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.420
 narration in other languages ​​with the 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:10.209
 Brazilian Portuguese but only the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.739
 narration in English is already great and the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.940
 people in the end the crowd also deserves 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.829
 Spotlight 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.750
 the songs are very famous in your 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.639
 great quality that in my opinion has 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.419
 to gain more prominence by appearing in 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.010
 June 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.099
 it also has several modes of 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.440
 play and show a little of the main 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.489
 the way you are handling team coach and 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 your choice 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.750
 and you can buy players who 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.359
 do custom searches for 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.220
 comparabilidades are sources player 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.769
 their cast and make a proposal of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.359
 loan transfers the options 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.340
 for the content of the team but were 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.079
 replacements and select 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.540
 diverse backgrounds of the shots hit the 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.319
 July and in standards for standing balls 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.180
 things like that so you're going to play 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.390
 here according to the standard calendar 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.430
 of the island of excellence 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.340
 I had my car here, I'm 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.030
 making fashion maggi pr stayed then it will already 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.520
 referendum with the facop branch championship o 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.660
 English so it's pretty cool this way 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.920
 play five sets for those who enjoy kind of 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.050
 transfer and negotiation thing if 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.480
 you can not be just the money that 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.209
 could have seven continents 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.130
 bringing democracy sell players 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.609
 players to renew contracts for the 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.609
 stuff like that 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.850
 already in the tournament it is possible to select a 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.040
 of the 135 kingdom to play the championship 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.350
 Entire contest the title campaign of the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.580
 selected team is a very similar way 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.980
 with the church 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.770
 The difference here is that you're only going to play 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.020
 their matches will hold the matches 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.300
 and according to the calendar you can 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.100
 consult the table also verify that 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.940
 the top scorers the next games of the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.030
 season 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.850
 so it's also a pretty cool way 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.860
 the game is organized by jim and despite 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.930
 do not allow games to air in real time 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.610
 He had to save his progress here. 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.560
 your data online 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.720
 Another high point of the game is 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.070
 ultimate team in which the player in his 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.270
 own team participates in campaigns 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.680
 online 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.570
 players are represented by 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.880
 Breeds that you listen to one of their 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.440
 friends to win with her to exchange 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.440
 for new players and who gives voice to players 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.150
 the fifa 14 also offers a blow 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.650
 called games of the week in which the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.479
 user may have at a party in the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.229
 matches of championships as he would 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.229
 play the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.190
 usoc in custom bar is possible 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.410
 make changes and controls in the 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.030
 video settings and here in the 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.830
 where we can still make a 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.330
 narration in English French Spanish 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.560
 German and Italian 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.990
