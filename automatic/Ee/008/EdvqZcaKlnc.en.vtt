00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
dust jacket and actually on the the

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.830

board's<00:00:55.980> themselves<00:00:56.670> beneath<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.629> dust

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
board's themselves beneath the dust

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
board's themselves beneath the dust
jacket<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.379> wanted<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> look<00:00:59.129> kind<00:00:59.910> of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
jacket so I wanted this to look kind of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.610 
jacket so I wanted this to look kind of
similar<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.870> very<00:01:00.899> clean<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
similar to that and be very clean and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.359 
similar to that and be very clean and
simple<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.629> I<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.899> used<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.470> standard<00:01:04.739> black

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
simple and I just used a standard black

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.960 
simple and I just used a standard black
buckram<00:01:06.060> cover<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.310> cheaper<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
buckram cover it was cheaper to do that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
buckram cover it was cheaper to do that
because<00:01:09.439> they<00:01:10.439> charge<00:01:10.740> extra<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.159> different

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
because they charge extra for different

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.070 
because they charge extra for different
colors<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.000> different<00:01:12.240> finishes<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
colors and different finishes and it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
colors and different finishes and it
just<00:01:13.229> looked<00:01:13.680> good<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.070> simple<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> clean<00:01:14.729> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
just looked good and simple and clean so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.200 
just looked good and simple and clean so
I<00:01:15.600> went<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.700> too<00:01:17.880> expensive

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I went with it it was not too expensive

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
I went with it it was not too expensive
overall<00:01:18.780> I'll<00:01:19.140> talk<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.650> maybe<00:01:20.009> I'll

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
overall I'll talk about that maybe I'll

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
overall I'll talk about that maybe I'll
put<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.700> info<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> description

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
includes white papers but I felt that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550 
includes white papers but I felt that
the<00:01:29.549> black<00:01:30.079> looked<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> little<00:01:31.350> more

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
with this this collects the first 25

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.790 
with this this collects the first 25
issues<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:26.970> series<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:28.080> could<00:02:28.560> have<00:02:28.650> gone

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
issues of the series I could have gone

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.710 
issues of the series I could have gone
with<00:02:29.370> more<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.060> didn't<00:02:30.360> want<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.569> get

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
with more but I didn't want it to get

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.440 
with more but I didn't want it to get
too<00:02:31.019> thick<00:02:31.400> because<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.549> makes<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.849> little

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
too thick because that makes a little

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.150 
too thick because that makes a little
bit<00:02:33.569> more<00:02:33.720> difficult<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.440> get<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.709> good<00:02:34.860> bind

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
bit more difficult to get a good bind

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.850 
bit more difficult to get a good bind
and<00:02:36.090> again<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.870> said<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.170> sown<00:02:37.410> binding

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and again like I said it's sown binding

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.390 
and again like I said it's sown binding
so<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.879> opens<00:02:39.180> nice<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.569> flat<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.400> there's

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
so it opens nice and flat and there's

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.360 
so it opens nice and flat and there's
minimal<00:02:41.640> gutter<00:02:42.060> loss<00:02:42.299> if<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.810> look<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:44.280> can

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
minimal gutter loss if you look you can

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.850 
minimal gutter loss if you look you can
see<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.640> I'm<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:45.780> losing<00:02:46.319> any<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
see that I'm not losing any of the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.190 
see that I'm not losing any of the
panels<00:02:47.340> or<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.760> words<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.510> dialogues<00:02:48.989> all

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
panels or the words the dialogues all

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.110 
panels or the words the dialogues all
there<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.329> one<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.480> advantages<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.170> using

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
there and one of the advantages to using

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.120 
there and one of the advantages to using
these<00:02:54.120> books<00:02:54.870> from<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.230> 80s<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:55.890> course

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
these books from the 80s and of course

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.119 
these books from the 80s and of course
even<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.579> 70s<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.540> older<00:02:57.780> etc<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.829> the

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
even the 70s and older etc is that the

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.470 
even the 70s and older etc is that the
panels<00:03:00.110> tend<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.590> be<00:03:02.549> kind<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:02.940> defined<00:03:03.299> by

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
panels tend to be kind of defined by

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.559 
panels tend to be kind of defined by
this<00:03:03.629> white<00:03:03.840> border<00:03:04.290> they're<00:03:04.950> separated<00:03:05.670> from

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
this white border they're separated from

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.509 
this white border they're separated from
the<00:03:06.720> ends<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.200> page<00:03:07.470> whereas<00:03:08.099> today<00:03:08.459> you

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
the ends of the page whereas today you

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.089 
the ends of the page whereas today you
get<00:03:08.879> these<00:03:09.239> full-bleed<00:03:09.930> pages<00:03:10.620> where<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
get these full-bleed pages where the

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.619 
get these full-bleed pages where the
colors<00:03:11.430> everything<00:03:11.819> goes<00:03:12.030> right<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> edge

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
colors everything goes right to the edge

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.479 
colors everything goes right to the edge
of<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> page<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.349> so<00:03:13.470> when<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.799> bind<00:03:14.069> stuff

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
of the page and so when you bind stuff

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.920 
of the page and so when you bind stuff
it<00:03:14.670> would<00:03:14.760> make<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.090> very<00:03:15.120> difficult<00:03:15.540> you're

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
it would make it very difficult you're

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.020 
it would make it very difficult you're
gonna<00:03:16.019> get<00:03:16.200> Gutter<00:03:16.410> loss<00:03:16.709> but<00:03:17.609> that's<00:03:17.790> not<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
gonna get Gutter loss but that's not the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.940 
gonna get Gutter loss but that's not the
case<00:03:18.180> with<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.510> older<00:03:18.810> stuff<00:03:19.079> as<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.920> can

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
case with this older stuff as you can

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.690 
case with this older stuff as you can
see<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.670> panels<00:03:21.440> basically<00:03:22.440> end<00:03:22.650> where<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
see the panels basically end where the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.610 
see the panels basically end where the
gutter<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.450> haven't<00:03:24.750> lost<00:03:24.870> anything<00:03:25.260> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
gutter is so I haven't lost anything and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.550 
gutter is so I haven't lost anything and
it<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:25.950> really<00:03:26.130> makes<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.459> easy<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.790> read

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
it and it really makes it easy to read

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.099 
it and it really makes it easy to read
so<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:29.010> use<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.180> kind<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.540> stuff<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
so if you can use this kind of stuff the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.039 
so if you can use this kind of stuff the
trade<00:03:31.319> paperbacks<00:03:31.799> or<00:03:32.069> older<00:03:32.340> issues<00:03:33.049> yeah
