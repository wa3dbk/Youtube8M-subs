 Y 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.680
 at 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.460
 or the goal on this occasion we will see the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.830
 osaka model of pt reliability 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 experience and economy summarized in a 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.770
 bs 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.050
 it is simply a digital thermostat 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.410
 for cooling with an input of 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 plc min etc probe and an output relay 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:53.250
 by mutated from 16 ap in panel format 32 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.980
 x 74 and 230 volt alternating power 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.150
 50-60 most commonly used examples for 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.100
 the temperature control in 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.589
 applications of cold heat with stool 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.659
 canches by the compressor thanks 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.299
 to its wide reading range in the 50's 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.280
 plus 150 degrees per decimal point 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.390
 configurable in the cold range 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.930
 between about 19.9 and 19 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.930
 l 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.799
 the model of mind is very simple 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.710
 connect on terminals 1 and 2 will 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.500
 will connect the power to the terminals 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.920
 10 and 11 we will connect the other pdc 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.200
 they can efe and at terminals 4 and 6 they 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.009
 connects the control phase to the compressor 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 or resistance 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.630
 it simply has parameters for 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.429
 configure the regulation of being by the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.189
 type of probe the regulation of 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.079
 temperature the discard control the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.210
 compressor protection and delays 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.700
 boot and configuration of the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.299
 keyboard alarms 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.299
 in him 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.080
 next we will see the parameters 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.470
 essential for proper functioning 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.580
 of equipment we will first access 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.120
 the configuration of parameters 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.090
 pressing the key for 5 seconds 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.280
 acronym ls on the display will indicate us in 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.260
 day we are inside the paracos 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.490
 display 0 enter the number of 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.710
 password and press p 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.030
 with the arrows we will pass the parameters 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.069
 until we reach the one we want to configure 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.100
 the first one where we're going to see is the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.100
 s &amp; p whose function is to configure the type 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.870
 to release we press the rule but to 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.670
 the treatment of the parameter and with the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.400
 arrow keys we select the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.130
 type of probe we want pp for pérez 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.080
 pérez d for him etc 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.540
 Once selected, press again 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.590
 to confirm 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.969
 the next is his when they will serve 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.450
 to set the differential of 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.890
 regulation press the key p and with 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.319
 the arrows we set the value that 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.410
 want to confirm to press 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.440
 usually 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.020
 then we have the parameter h c 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.660
 that will help us to configure the mode 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.610
 of working the heat or cold to 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.980
 configure it we do the same process 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.050
 we press matter and by the arrows 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.990
 we configure the value that interests us 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.920
 for our application h and for the 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.430
 Heat pulls for cold once 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.230
 selected press pei to confirm 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.940
 If our application is cold we can 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.420
 set the interior with 3 escarches 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.060
 with the parameter of y programmed by 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.250
 defect in six hours we press the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.450
 rule p and with the arrows we configure 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.370
 the time that we want for once 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.140
 indicated we press the rule to 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.700
 confirm 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.370
 the next parallel that we will see is that of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.610
 used to set the time 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.610
 programmed by default 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.770
 the same process pressured by the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.390
 arrows we set the right value and 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.360
 confirm by pressing the p key again 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.310
 finally today we will see the parameter efe 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.740
 that will help us to put the 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.710
 operation of the key 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.209
 we enter pressing and then if 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.980
 we want to activate the shutdown function and 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.160
 lit with the betas we compared the 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.140
 value 1 if on the contrary we want 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.340
 deactivate we will leave your value 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.510
 default in confirm by pressing 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.220
 again 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.230
 once we have all the parameters 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.210
 configured press the key 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.060
 go down for two seconds to go back to 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.520
 the important main visualization 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.860
 there is a version available by network of 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.540
 great power for compressors up to 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.260
 two horses 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.510
 the model depends 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.890
 and up to here the model of 20 as 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.890
 it's always a pleasure until
