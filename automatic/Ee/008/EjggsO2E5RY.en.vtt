00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:03.939
 so just as taken to buy this common point I will show you a 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:06.070
 functionality 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 very very useful the connection sharing 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:10.859
 so the man 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.659
 I get lost I enjoy my connection 3g a good internet network 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.329
 and for a young Swiss in August signed by a laptop a tablet 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.739
 or other device and its internet access 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.349
 so I share my collection 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.519
 and I do not need to hook it up by cabu is moved emerges then deported 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.179
 left for the tablet 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.449
 I do enjoy so less reception 3g janssen enjoy in russia 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.190
 So I do not think I have multiple devices at the same time 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.190
 so be it's for action 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 with this string that make 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.090
 me I can beforehand moutier the name of the router 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 rte which will appear on appointment on the tablet 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.620
 choose it 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.390
 security mode the password 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 and the number of users that will be able to connect 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 lay down you were five years old 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.860
 in Guadeloupe 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.450
 in duplicate wpa2 payers 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 but no security 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.890
 I modify so 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 leaves to appear this Tuesday all of the film 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 limited the connection to 22 devices that up to eight users 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.590
 structure 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.910
 it's very useful 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.000
 for those who have touch pads and who does not want to be burdened with a 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.910
 second package so he uses their smartphones as at 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.980
 counter 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.000
 are part of their collections so the pit of the stomach the eventual what I 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 know steadily he's completely unlocking when we 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.620
 compare affected by operators 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.620
 so not limit the functions what he did on 100 th on the desire that 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.810
 I had a desire to break 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.890
 the mdm had left the crowd of features 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.150
 but for 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.820
 unworthy best practices I share my connection with a tablet 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.730
 but not with a laptop 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.010
 a portable dandy so they had limited us this function 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.780
 these guys I have no problem with this version so completely 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.579
 unblock 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.789
 and that's what was committed to hands 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.249
 very very useful especially - and in the tablet era that a lot of 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.909
 people a tablet and a smartphone 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.099
 I think the packages today reaches its are very expensive at 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.309
 the ladies the operators hope besides that they will send their 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.519
 girlfriends 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.849
 since we are not all ready to accumulate packages like 5% 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.989
 vivendi 40 euros a month in June a public debt of ottawa with nothing of 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.119
 more 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.429
 so 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.279
 the wifi access point 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.359
 which is very useful then after five years operator who detects when we 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.609
 serves as the router of his counter 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.479
 and that if there were indeed that one must count the strengths not to sink 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.049
 sovereign rake will be made the most precarious 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.219
 vox the operator over five days 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:54.949
 that was the case
