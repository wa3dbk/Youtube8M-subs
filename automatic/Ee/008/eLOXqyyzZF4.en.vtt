00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.160
 registering a new sheet 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.800
 Now let's go to the materials we are going to register 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 a new material to see how it works 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.099
 from the start 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.570
 How are you watching the show? 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.489
 suggests a code 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.669
 if you prefer another number for your 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.590
 The plate is just to change, but in the case, let's go. 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.250
 accept this suggestion 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.140
 So just give it ok, we give you a name now. 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.820
 for our plate that can be of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.490
 any acrylic glass material wood 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.810
 steel or styrofoam anything we go 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.480
 put for example mdf and 15 minutes 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.310
 For now let's leave aside the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 other two fields that are not 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.940
 required 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.250
 We'll go back to them later, we 'll go now. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.200
 this water to set the properties 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.110
 of this material 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.120
 as you see it is just open and the alert is 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.759
 blinking to warn you that if you have 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 questions or any item to the button at 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.570
 side with explanation 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.570
 for example in this first item 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.700
 thickness used for cutting 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.940
 if even with the illustration you do not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.010
 To understand, just press this 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.770
 information that was there and here it is 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.810
 thickness in the saw so that the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.479
 loss of material due to the cut is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.290
 considered to be materials whose value is 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.540
 such as clarified video 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 this again click the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.979
 information to close a message that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.869
 as our saw-cut material 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.080
 Let's put a thick beach here. 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.390
 for example 4 millimeters 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.460
 the item below is for the configuration of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 a minimum size for the works 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.470
 let 10 it is possible to happen 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.820
 some surplus so small as to be smaller 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.909
 that the thickness of the saw 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.640
 this leftover is next to the saw will have to 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.220
 pass partially off the plate 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.380
 this is only for the internal force between 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.590
 two pieces in the hotel serra nor can 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.539
 cutting maps with leftovers as 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.330
 small ones are fast but this can 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.220
 even for those who cut glass in 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.310
 that in the thickness of saw a leftover 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.130
 too narrow may make it difficult for 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.170
 Ideally, leave at least one leftover 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.550
 with the thickness of the saw 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.010
 but some users prefer 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.739
 try to leave will be to try the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.690
 best possible use in our 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.019
 example we will leave the same thickness 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.230
 from the sane and now we come to the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.349
 configuration of the retail flap to the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.390
 right body is the leverage she used 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.780
 represented in the cutting plane by the color 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.910
 yellow and leftover is the loss that is 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.549
 represented by the color blue 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.500
 here we will indicate to the program which 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.450
 is the minimum usable size 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 for example 20 by 20 centimeters as the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.590
 program only works with millimeters 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.690
 we type 200 and 201 means that smaller 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.500
 that this cut right will understand that it is 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.230
 loss 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.269
 if you prefer you can also opt for 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.280
 use a minimum area in square meters 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.700
 instead of height and width 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.610
 the next item margin of safety for 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.570
 plate is useful for anyone who needs a squad 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.000
 already the plate before or to clean 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.459
 edges that may have been damaged in the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.570
 transport but we will leave all 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.209
 generated sides 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.310
 now let's go to the first item on the other 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.160
 side that can be very important for 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.140
 who will cut 1 wood for example and 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.930
 want to maintain the direction of the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.209
 parts the same as in other materials 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.780
 corrugated glass to prevent some 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.430
 parts 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.120
 the windows are horizontal 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.400
 in others vertically what we are going to do 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.660
 here is to prevent the plate from being generated 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.260
 at the time of calculation 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.120
 then the allowed quotation does not 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.970
 penultimate item of physical properties 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.040
 material will only be used if you 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.530
 want the program cut the pieces one 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.780
 slightly larger than the digital size for 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.540
 compensate for the costs of sandpaper for example 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.180
 or to steal a little smaller 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.280
 if applied at the edge of one piece 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.539
 tape or a component that will increase the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.419
 your size 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.150
 only enter a negative value or 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.240
 positive but we will stop being there like 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.500
 state and last exclusive item for those who 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.780
 works with some kind of 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.760
 material cut with Chinese corn if the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.010
 plate has one of the higher input sides 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.230
 routine the program will always do 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.360
 first cut to be cut by the 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.670
 lower side of the plate 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.310
 in general how you are seeing 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.260
 drawings help to refresh the memory 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.090
 but if there is doubt about bad it is only 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.910
 press an info button 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.630
 This done we give the ok to close the 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.570
 window 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.670
 then click on plates to dictate 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.440
 our stock of this material 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.260
 let's put in the first column a 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.110
 any amount whatsoever without plates 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.220
 the winter to change column and we 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.220
 in the width of 2,750 millimeters and in 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.260
 height 1830 mm 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.840
 remember that the right cut always uses 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.510
 millimeters as default in description 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.510
 Let's enroll standard plate. 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.169
 if you have any other plate of the same 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.210
 material but with different dimensions is 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.210
 just hit enter to open a new line 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.440
 anyway this work you will only have one 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.540
 for each material 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.700
 after you have registered you will hardly 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.390
 need to change something 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.390
 be the quantity
