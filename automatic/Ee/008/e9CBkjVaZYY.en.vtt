make a homemade solar heater with two
very<00:00:07.529> easy<00:00:07.770> things<00:00:08.420> first<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.200> a

very easy things first is going to be a
black<00:00:10.740> trash<00:00:11.070> bag<00:00:11.750> reason<00:00:12.750> we<00:00:12.840> use<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> black

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
black trash bag reason we use a black

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.620 
black trash bag reason we use a black
trash<00:00:13.740> bag<00:00:13.980> because<00:00:14.400> black<00:00:14.790> will<00:00:15.150> absorb<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
trash bag because black will absorb the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.410 
trash bag because black will absorb the
heat<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.139> will<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.350> let<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> heat<00:00:16.590> go<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
heat and it will not let the heat go and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.849 
heat and it will not let the heat go and
you<00:00:18.420> can<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> Dollar<00:00:18.990> Tree<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.590> just

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
you can go to the Dollar Tree and just

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.490 
you can go to the Dollar Tree and just
get<00:00:20.010> any<00:00:20.270> hula-hoop<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.539> bigger<00:00:21.810> ones<00:00:22.050> look

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
get any hula-hoop the bigger ones look

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.019 
get any hula-hoop the bigger ones look
better<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.039> they<00:00:23.130> fill<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> bag<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
better because they fill up the bag and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.950 
better because they fill up the bag and
make<00:00:24.199> more<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> surface<00:00:25.590> area<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.220> cover<00:00:26.960> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
make more of a surface area to cover and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.700 
make more of a surface area to cover and
then<00:00:28.140> you'll<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> trash<00:00:28.800> bag<00:00:36.620> open<00:00:37.620> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
then you'll take the trash bag open it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
then you'll take the trash bag open it

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.920 

take<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:58.190> ends<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.670> trash<00:00:58.879> bag<00:00:59.149> it<00:00:59.629> works

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
take the ends of the trash bag it works

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.479 
take the ends of the trash bag it works
better<00:01:00.140> if<00:01:00.350> they<00:01:00.440> have<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.680> flat<00:01:00.890> type<00:01:01.159> so<00:01:01.399> you

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
better if they have the flat type so you

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.069 
better if they have the flat type so you
can<00:01:01.670> tie<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:01.909> or<00:01:02.180> if<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:02.690> can<00:01:02.780> get<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:02.899> long

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
can tie it or if you can get a long

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.229 
can tie it or if you can get a long
enough<00:01:03.140> one<00:01:03.589> with<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.489> twist<00:01:04.759> ties<00:01:04.970> that

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
enough one with the twist ties that

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.300 
enough one with the twist ties that
convert<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.780> either<00:01:06.200> one<00:01:08.680> tie<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.740> up<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:10.130> so

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
convert to either one tie it up like so

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.300 
convert to either one tie it up like so
it<00:01:13.310> doesn't<00:01:13.759> matter<00:01:13.940> if<00:01:14.649> there's<00:01:15.649> a<00:01:15.740> hole<00:01:16.039> in

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
it doesn't matter if there's a hole in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.980 
it doesn't matter if there's a hole in
it<00:01:16.430> because<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.119> hula<00:01:17.299> hoop<00:01:17.509> is<00:01:17.690> what's<00:01:17.869> going

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
it because the hula hoop is what's going

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:26.109 
it because the hula hoop is what's going
to<00:01:18.049> make<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.289> float<00:01:23.679> and<00:01:24.909> then<00:01:25.909> you're<00:01:26.030> going

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
to make it float and then you're going

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.730 
to make it float and then you're going
to<00:01:26.179> take<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:26.960> you're<00:01:27.409> just<00:01:27.530> going<00:01:27.679> to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
to take this and you're just going to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.800 
to take this and you're just going to
throw<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.369> in<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.580> pool<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:29.300> more<00:01:29.539> that<00:01:29.690> you

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
throw it in the pool the more that you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.620 
throw it in the pool the more that you
have<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.229> better<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:31.490> more<00:01:32.000> surface<00:01:32.330> area

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
have the better the more surface area

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.149 
have the better the more surface area
that<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.960> can<00:01:33.140> cover<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.740> more<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:34.009> it's

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
that you can cover the more that it's

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.559 
that you can cover the more that it's
going<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.399> heat<00:01:34.550> up<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.060> black<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.479> going

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
going to heat up and the black is going

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.809 
going to heat up and the black is going
to<00:01:35.630> enable<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.229> water<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.649> be<00:01:36.770> able<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:37.159> stay

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
to enable the water to be able to stay

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.100 
to enable the water to be able to stay
warm<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.300> it's<00:01:38.390> going<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.539> hold<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.869> heat<00:01:39.080> in

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
warm and it's going to hold the heat in

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.080 
warm and it's going to hold the heat in
once<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.649> heats<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:39.950> up<00:01:40.100> now<00:01:40.610> let's<00:01:40.789> go<00:01:40.940> over<00:01:40.970> to

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
once it heats it up now let's go over to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.919 
once it heats it up now let's go over to
the<00:01:41.270> pool<00:01:45.520> okay<00:01:46.520> here's<00:01:46.819> the<00:01:47.450> kids<00:01:47.690> in<00:01:47.840> the

have<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.729> floats<00:01:52.969> on<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:53.390> now<00:01:53.509> we<00:01:53.570> take

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
have the floats on it right now we take

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:54.999 
have the floats on it right now we take
them<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.079> set<00:01:54.229> them<00:01:54.289> to<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.500> side<00:01:54.590> whenever

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
them and set them to the side whenever

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.109 
them and set them to the side whenever
