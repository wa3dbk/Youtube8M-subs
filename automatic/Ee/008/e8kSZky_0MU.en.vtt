00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
first build of a truck I've undertaken

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.369 
first build of a truck I've undertaken
since<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.950> was<00:00:37.940> a<00:00:38.030> teenager<00:00:38.300> which<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:39.019> a<00:00:39.050> long

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
since I was a teenager which is a long

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.040 
since I was a teenager which is a long
time<00:00:39.410> ago<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.820> bit<00:00:41.390> rough<00:00:41.600> around<00:00:41.749> the<00:00:41.989> edges

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
time ago so a bit rough around the edges

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.040 
time ago so a bit rough around the edges
a<00:00:42.649> bit<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:43.309> a<00:00:43.370> learning<00:00:43.730> process<00:00:44.050> but

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
a bit of a learning process but

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.770 
a bit of a learning process but
nonetheless<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.859> found<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.699> kit<00:00:46.879> quite<00:00:47.449> good<00:00:47.749> I

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
nonetheless I found the kit quite good I

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.770 
nonetheless I found the kit quite good I
found<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.260> instructions<00:00:48.620> quite<00:00:49.609> good<00:00:49.879> a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
found the instructions quite good a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.569 
found the instructions quite good a
couple<00:00:51.199> of<00:00:51.409> little<00:00:51.559> points<00:00:51.829> with<00:00:52.129> vague<00:00:52.339> you

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
couple of little points with vague you

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.970 
couple of little points with vague you
had<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:52.969> try<00:00:53.839> and<00:00:53.870> work<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.230> out<00:00:54.319> for<00:00:54.499> yourself

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
had to try and work it out for yourself

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.739 
had to try and work it out for yourself
but<00:00:55.249> generally<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.940> general<00:00:56.239> thrust<00:00:56.390> of<00:00:56.629> it

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
but generally the general thrust of it

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.009 
but generally the general thrust of it
was<00:00:56.899> quite<00:00:57.140> clear<00:00:58.059> some<00:00:59.059> nice<00:00:59.239> box<00:00:59.569> out<00:00:59.780> there

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
was quite clear some nice box out there

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:07.780 
was quite clear some nice box out there
you<00:01:00.079> get<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.229> nice<00:01:00.409> box<00:01:02.920> see<00:01:03.920> there<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:07.580> truck

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
you get a nice box see there the truck

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.980 
you get a nice box see there the truck
itself<00:01:09.759> decals<00:01:10.759> went<00:01:10.939> on<00:01:11.060> well<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:11.689> forth

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
nice lot of chrome bits on it the tip

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.440 
nice lot of chrome bits on it the tip
out<00:01:17.299> actually<00:01:17.540> moves<00:01:18.350> up<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.939> moves<00:01:20.210> up

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
out actually moves up that that moves up

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.510 
out actually moves up that that moves up
and<00:01:21.049> some<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:21.770> can<00:01:21.890> see<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.219> can<00:01:22.340> put

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
and some of it you can see you can put

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.850 
and some of it you can see you can put
it<00:01:22.610> up<00:01:22.729> at<00:01:22.850> different<00:01:23.000> angles<00:01:23.710> in<00:01:24.710> the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
it up at different angles in the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.480 
it up at different angles in the
someone's<00:01:25.250> are<00:01:25.369> they<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:27.799> front<00:01:28.039> wheels<00:01:28.340> you

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
someone's are they the front wheels you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.190 
someone's are they the front wheels you
can<00:01:28.520> make<00:01:28.969> to<00:01:29.240> turn<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.820> actual<00:01:32.210> sprues<00:01:32.990> it

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
can make to turn the actual sprues it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.459 
can make to turn the actual sprues it
was<00:01:33.289> about<00:01:33.500> five<00:01:33.710> six<00:01:33.920> screws<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.549> found<00:01:35.469> the

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
was about five six screws I found the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.340 
was about five six screws I found the
tie<00:01:37.369> rods<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.119> forth<00:01:38.390> all<00:01:38.600> very<00:01:39.079> very

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
tie rods and so forth all very very

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.109 
tie rods and so forth all very very
micro<00:01:39.920> thinner<00:01:40.159> but<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.520> suppose<00:01:40.820> they're<00:01:41.030> in

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
micro thinner but I suppose they're in

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.840 
micro thinner but I suppose they're in
scale<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:41.930> did<00:01:42.229> snap<00:01:42.469> one<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.829> them<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.219> just

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
scale and I did snap one of them so just

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.219 
scale and I did snap one of them so just
be<00:01:44.060> warned<00:01:44.390> if<00:01:44.450> you're<00:01:44.539> going<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:44.840> attempt

layout<00:01:48.409> here<00:01:49.299> instructions<00:01:53.859> there's<00:01:55.179> folds

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
layout here instructions there's folds

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.100 
layout here instructions there's folds
right<00:01:56.390> out<00:01:56.630> here

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.360 

right<00:02:00.110> through<00:02:01.780> seven<00:02:02.780> steps<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:03.560> you

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
right through seven steps and then you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.020 
right through seven steps and then you
reverse<00:02:04.670> over<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.540> rear<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.040> 14<00:02:07.730> step

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
reverse over to the rear it's a 14 step

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.850 
reverse over to the rear it's a 14 step
procedure<00:02:08.450> according<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.260> instructions
