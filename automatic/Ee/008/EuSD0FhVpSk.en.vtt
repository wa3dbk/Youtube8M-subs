00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 yes hello people what is going on and warm 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.960
 Welcome to the first update of the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.960
 splash miss winter event server aastra 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 james bond the first we have everything 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.119
 already seen and I wanted you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.500
 Just a little in this video 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.090
 update of the plots give the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.230
 I am now here around the tree 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 Of course, not everyone can show it because of it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.830
 really some are already and it is genuine 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.269
 I'll give you some nice ones 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.220
 Of course, first wants to show and after 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.150
 I would be off if a few prag for 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.610
 you come in and a few more 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.600
 Announcements make but first 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 look a bit the plots 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.170
 I've noticed many things 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.700
 have just terra from operated on 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 the plot of the have simply per 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.260
 hand , they have this easy 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.879
 mountains hingebaut or something yeah so I 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.320
 In any case, partly from what the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.239
 people have made a nice too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.219
 idea splash all the way to writing here 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.660
 a little christmas tree behind 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.579
 I really liked that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.520
 the house there what we see again 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.840
 made again terraforming here 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 So I'm pretty nice anyway 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.350
 the replica or not until you do not 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.149
 but are of course nachgucken 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 before we evaluate here the whole 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.420
 power is now only the third day 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 and finally are average beliefs 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.100
 about 40 people on it like that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 clock-year 42 is the start of each 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.150
 case a nice thing on the release so 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 At the start of the event was also 60 believe 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.600
 I have the highest number even at the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.619
 maximum slot number reached as mcs 24 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.759
 has seen that all so well 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.960
 Once they have arrived we have said 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.640
 put another gigabyte on it 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.170
 so that's not here anyway 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.570
 server problems comes and that of course 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.860
 then always enough ram on the status in cell 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.170
 See you down here again 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 terraforming operated here one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 Yeah, I put down a nice Christmas tree 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 of course, as I said, not everything 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.070
 Show here a snowman looks made 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.420
 in any case also right opportunities arising from 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.180
 but show us what we do 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 I think it was true that I had a gamble 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 girl julia started a reindeer too 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.500
 to build 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.329
 Looks definitely from the house that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.159
 I think in the direction but there 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.409
 we'll get the same number up here 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.390
 right at the beginning is cool it too 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.869
 So you have to build on the idea first 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.909
 come 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.619
 where will go where gigantic 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.090
 Christmas tree built if I sometimes 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.530
 curious what the end looks like here 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.960
 also really nicely done stand 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.500
 landscape easy with water and the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.150
 line and then so fast 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 Definitely a nice thing and 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.680
 Just stop by right mountain 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.840
 hand-crafted people we were looking for 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.160
 partly real through and that makes me happy 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.510
 just huge I have already heard 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.620
 many do not make it just stop now 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.330
 just at the beginning of his wise easy 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.250
 Huge fun in the event we have what we 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.320
 Of course, it's also great to hear here 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.270
 I think a huge turngau times 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.040
 as I say the whole situation now 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.810
 Here's what I like very well 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.730
 liked this cut is here 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.890
 who is also very nice, especially 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.590
 from the front in the nice face like that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.150
 here so smiling face and there 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.739
 so be sure to have one 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.630
 nice thing 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.640
 What will happen here will be that 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.680
 finally show an advent wreath here 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.180
 In any case, you have to go first 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.860
 come 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.600
 here, too, has built a great many 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.720
 ask how to get there at no cost 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.430
 I can easily tell you that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.350
 Let's go to the start 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.520
 there is a jump'n'run there for 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.220
 those who have not noticed 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.930
 if you mastered that then get 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 one at 16 otherwise one can once on 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.580
 make day and get there 16 how to 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.920
 this country from the limited artworks around 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.330
 a nice designer then gets power 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.170
 16 volos just such a small one 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.370
 So play practically already 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.260
 make a customized job so this will be 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.850
 reindeer built that is really a ne idea there 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.989
 you have to come first if really 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.799
 beautifully designed 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.060
 Of course, I do not believe so yet 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.290
 finish call open here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.269
 there will be something to look at 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.400
 come out here in presents 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.440
 Christmas trees burn quite often 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.090
 made somehow something to see 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.489
 so of course everything comes out now 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.630
 not really ready answered the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.070
 busters As for keeping up to date 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.320
 Of course, I can not do it all 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.459
 land show but could have the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.630
 as you can already see easily 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.700
 yourself on the server on it comes to you 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.230
 but look around and then just 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.459
 Let's see what you like so much 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.400
 and get a few inspirations 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.400
 Of course, do not copy one to one 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.750
 14 students also cut very nicely 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.090
 everything done with the trees outside 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.430
 such a small house on the mountain so 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.010
 Real reforms were also carried out here 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.239
 I just think so or exactly what 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.170
 just one more thing is still me 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.570
 want to clarify 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.710
 many people build up to several a year 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.300
 a plot 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.250
 and that is now against Japan of 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.900
 or not a few questions come 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.250
 So that's the price 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.300
 You know how it works when it does 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.350
 not anymore then I would have to someday 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.300
 watch the information game 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.770
 The prices are yes per plot 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.210
 that is not the player who distributes that 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.410
 is called now five people on the 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.420
 building land will somehow be that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.920
 first place because not get any just 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.810
 they still get a price effect 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.520
 quite normally a price from the first 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.980
 winning class 1 from the second so that 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.140
 is quite normal that remains so and that 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.240
 will not change otherwise that 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.370
 all year minimal unfair I say now 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.290
 That's the way it is, and that's why I have it that way 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.120
 So distributed prices per plot so 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.830
 I also have many buildings per building 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.360
 asked how rated the jury on 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.700
 in the end we will all be in the standard 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.470
 Textures package rate the buildings 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.550
 maybe I'll use the shader 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.900
 in which I'm going in there too 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.100
 but maybe not, I think the 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.600
 do not make such a big difference 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.700
 I think it's important just that 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.890
 use resistance pack that looks like that 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.360
 all the same user just equated that yes 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.800
 the most important thing in the evaluation of the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.060
 Furthermore, have him much about it 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.640
 complains that it's so hard 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.310
 Items on rare items complicate from the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.690
 hell in what kind of weather or do I say 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.130
 Generally, items are generally easy to use 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.500
 hard to find such as jimmy 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.570
 chalepo world somehow very little air 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.800
 to give in cocoa beans very much 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.080
 hard to get something because of that 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.940
 what made us think a bit 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.260
 it also helped on the desktop 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.090
 service in action if you have a video 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.590
 then you got the money 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.820
 on the server we have something there 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.560
 similar thought and that if you 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.820
 make a youtube video over the server 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:35.410
 one receives 20 16 cocoa beans in 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.860
 recycled recycling 16 without sound 26 white 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.550
 wool 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.900
 Two sheep ponies and 20 sponge it though 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.210
 to make a video about the server 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.920
 whole action is unique that means one 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.060
 video or you can of course 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.740
 make several videos but you get 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.210
 stop synonymous if you make a video 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.590
 this bonus if this is still extended 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.690
 let's take a look 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.950
 I get on it because some of me 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.360
 German im written that here 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.460
 would like to make videoserver if you 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.840
 that are allowed and allowed you are 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.740
 really like to do it and get it now 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.780
 she even has something for it 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.130
 so definitely something for everyone 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.080
 when out when you for example 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.180
 twitter post makes just where just says 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.640
 Here are people that are the event I think 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.340
 I am also cool and so on 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.639
 you get 10 level rac1 day wool 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.900
 and 10 monasteries 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.610
 Now maybe I'll wait like 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.560
 Are you experiencing that because then I'm like that 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.360
 a video via twitter post the whole 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.909
 just simply under this video the
