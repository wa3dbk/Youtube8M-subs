00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
it should show up last on your screen I

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.680 
it should show up last on your screen I

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
had to come back here at a later time so

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.029 
had to come back here at a later time so
that's<00:05:45.840> why<00:05:45.990> it's<00:05:46.169> a<00:05:46.320> little<00:05:46.830> bit<00:05:46.919> out<00:05:47.009> of

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
that's why it's a little bit out of

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.999 
that's why it's a little bit out of
order<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.580> then<00:05:48.300> from<00:05:48.659> that<00:05:48.810> we<00:05:49.139> can<00:05:49.169> see<00:05:49.380> a

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.920 
interact with that we'll start the
cinematic<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.000> the<00:06:09.210> level<00:06:09.449> is<00:06:09.570> a<00:06:09.599> stack<00:06:09.900> of

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
cinematic and the level is a stack of

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.990 
cinematic and the level is a stack of
papers<00:06:10.440> that's<00:06:10.770> really<00:06:11.400> all<00:06:11.520> I'm<00:06:11.610> gonna<00:06:11.699> say

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
papers that's really all I'm gonna say

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.469 
papers that's really all I'm gonna say
it's<00:06:12.960> pretty<00:06:13.229> random<00:06:13.500> because<00:06:14.240> it's<00:06:15.240> not

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
it's pretty random because it's not

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.029 
it's pretty random because it's not
really<00:06:15.750> you<00:06:16.139> don't<00:06:16.289> end<00:06:16.440> up<00:06:16.500> finding<00:06:16.830> anything

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
really you don't end up finding anything

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.010 
really you don't end up finding anything
and<00:06:17.400> it<00:06:17.490> just<00:06:17.760> it<00:06:17.940> just<00:06:18.090> randomly<00:06:18.570> triggers

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
and it just it just randomly triggers

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.709 
and it just it just randomly triggers
the<00:06:19.169> end<00:06:19.320> of<00:06:19.500> this<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.539> level<00:06:21.539> so<00:06:21.570> just

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
the end of this of the level so just

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:22.030 
the end of this of the level so just
make

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
make

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.890
