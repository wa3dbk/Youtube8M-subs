hello this Eagle 11 and this is the
fourth<00:00:03.510> part<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.899> my<00:00:04.020> tutorial<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.740> making<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
fourth part of my tutorial and making a

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230 
fourth part of my tutorial and making a
simple<00:00:05.310> iphone<00:00:05.759> game<00:00:06.620> today<00:00:07.620> I'm<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.519> go

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240

through<00:00:10.700> making<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.730> ball<00:00:11.940> bounced<00:00:12.269> off<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
through making the ball bounced off the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.609 
through making the ball bounced off the
platforms<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.820> getting<00:00:14.820> touch<00:00:15.750> control

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
platforms and getting touch control

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.800 
platforms and getting touch control
working<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> first<00:00:18.390> thing<00:00:18.510> we're<00:00:18.720> going

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
working so the first thing we're going

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.380 
working so the first thing we're going
to<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.890> set<00:00:20.130> up<00:00:20.160> an<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.520> statement<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:21.240> each

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
to do is set up an if statement for each

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
to do is set up an if statement for each
platform<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.320> we're<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:23.210> CG

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210

rack<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:35.510> use<00:00:36.510> ball<00:00:36.870> frame<00:00:38.780> for<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:39.960> argument

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
rack and use ball frame for one argument

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.160 
rack and use ball frame for one argument
and<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.430> other<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.820> platform<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:43.309> frame

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
and the other will be platform one frame

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.979 
and the other will be platform one frame
those<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.520> frames<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.510> images<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
those are the frames of the images that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.450 
those are the frames of the images that
we<00:00:49.170> used<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.399> return<00:00:53.699> true<00:00:54.210> if

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
we used and so this will return true if

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
we used and so this will return true if
those<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:56.879> images<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.480> overlapping<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.620> then

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
those two images are overlapping so then

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
those two images are overlapping so then
if<00:00:59.039> they're<00:00:59.190> overlapping<00:00:59.550> next<00:01:00.120> thing<00:01:00.239> we

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
if they're overlapping next thing we

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.520 
if they're overlapping next thing we
want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:02.899> kind<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.320> they're

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
want to see is kind of where they're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.080 
want to see is kind of where they're
overlapping<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
overlapping because we don't want it to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.289 
overlapping because we don't want it to
be<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:07.200> where<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.830> ball<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.100> hitting<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
be to where the ball is hitting the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.600 
be to where the ball is hitting the
bottom<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> platform<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.340> want<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
bottom of the platform we don't want it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.770 
bottom of the platform we don't want it
to<00:01:11.700> bounce<00:01:11.850> off<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.360> case<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:14.330> save<00:01:15.330> ball

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
to bounce off in that case so save ball

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.370 
to bounce off in that case so save ball

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
continue on and say we want to make sure

that<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> ball<00:01:40.189> velocity<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:42.110> greater<00:01:43.110> than

that the ball velocity is greater than
zero<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> means<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.490> falling<00:01:45.740> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
zero because that means it's falling and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.090 
zero because that means it's falling and

if it is involve velocity equal negative
ok<00:01:56.149> jump<00:01:57.149> power<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.820> show<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.570> but

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
ok jump power and and show you this but

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.700 
ok jump power and and show you this but
I<00:02:00.899> defined<00:02:01.439> k<00:02:01.799> jump<00:02:02.070> power<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.869> just

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
I defined k jump power just for just

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.709 
I defined k jump power just for just
make<00:02:04.950> easy<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.460> edit<00:02:05.579> later<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.509> want<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
make easy to edit later if we want to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.230 
make easy to edit later if we want to
edit<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.049> jump<00:02:07.259> power<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:09.929> nine

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
edit the jump power and so that's nine

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.430 
edit the jump power and so that's nine
now<00:02:12.780> closed<00:02:13.230> off<00:02:13.440> these<00:02:13.710> brackets<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.220> and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:21.110 

two<00:03:10.440> warriors<00:03:12.350> do<00:03:18.680> all<00:03:19.680> right<00:03:19.880> hopefully<00:03:20.880> to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
two warriors do all right hopefully to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.310 
two warriors do all right hopefully to
work<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:21.420> one<00:03:21.630> there<00:03:22.080> we<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:23.000> um<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.200> it's

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
work this one there we go um so it's

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.720 
work this one there we go um so it's
bouncing<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:27.710> looks<00:03:28.710> pretty<00:03:28.920> good<00:03:29.100> now<00:03:29.670> we

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
bouncing and looks pretty good now we

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.150 
bouncing and looks pretty good now we
have<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.090> work<00:03:30.540> on<00:03:30.750> movement<00:03:33.050> right<00:03:34.050> as<00:03:34.890> you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
have to work on movement right as you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.890 
have to work on movement right as you
can<00:03:35.280> see<00:03:35.490> I<00:03:35.520> already<00:03:35.640> began<00:03:36.240> working<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.720> that

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
can see I already began working on that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.820 
can see I already began working on that
just<00:03:37.830> because<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.610> time<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.440> I'm<00:03:40.530> going<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.710> go

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
just because of time so I'm going to go

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.560 
just because of time so I'm going to go
through<00:03:41.010> what's<00:03:41.250> happening<00:03:41.730> here<00:03:43.040> first<00:03:44.570> over

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
through what's happening here first over

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.260 
through what's happening here first over
here<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.440> made<00:03:47.430> another<00:03:48.090> NSA<00:03:48.960> I<00:03:49.320> integer<00:03:50.270> which

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
here I made another NSA I integer which

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.960 
here I made another NSA I integer which
is<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> touch<00:03:52.260> state<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.430> kind<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.820> going

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
is a touch state and it's kind of going

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.990 
is a touch state and it's kind of going
to<00:03:54.060> work<00:03:54.210> like<00:03:54.450> game<00:03:54.870> state<00:03:55.520> because<00:03:56.520> I<00:03:56.790> made

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
to work like game state because I made

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.900 
to work like game state because I made
some<00:03:57.360> defines<00:03:57.990> for<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.640> we<00:03:59.760> would

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
some defines for it so that we would

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.390 
some defines for it so that we would
know<00:04:00.060> whether<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.690> left<00:04:00.930> right<00:04:01.470> whether

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
know whether the left right whether

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.950 
know whether the left right whether
someone's<00:04:02.790> touching<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.360> left<00:04:03.540> side<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
someone's touching on the left side the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.710 
someone's touching on the left side the
right<00:04:04.080> side<00:04:04.140> or<00:04:04.710> all<00:04:05.490> touches<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:06.000> ended<00:04:06.300> and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.540 

right<00:04:09.720> here<00:04:10.050> as<00:04:10.260> types<00:04:10.560> ended<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.190> it's<00:04:11.430> going

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
right here as types ended and it's going

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.160 
right here as types ended and it's going
to<00:04:11.610> set<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.940> touch<00:04:12.120> state<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.510> touch<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.720> ended

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
to set the touch state to touch it ended

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.360 
to set the touch state to touch it ended
so<00:04:14.030> I'll<00:04:15.030> go<00:04:15.150> through<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:15.450> now<00:04:15.950> first<00:04:16.950> checks

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so I'll go through this now first checks

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.530 
so I'll go through this now first checks
to<00:04:17.520> make<00:04:17.790> sure<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:18.420> in<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.660> running<00:04:18.989> state

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
to make sure it's in the running state

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.260 
to make sure it's in the running state
this<00:04:22.010> gets<00:04:23.010> all<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.310> touches<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:24.060> gets

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
this gets all the touches and that gets

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.660 
this gets all the touches and that gets
the<00:04:24.419> location<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.140> time

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
the location of the time

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.890 
the location of the time
we<00:04:27.670> check<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:27.970> see<00:04:28.300> if<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.630> location<00:04:29.440> X<00:04:29.710> is

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
we check to see if the location X is

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.740 
we check to see if the location X is
less<00:04:31.900> than<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.800> center<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.310> screen<00:04:33.520> if<00:04:34.330> it

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
less than the center of the screen if it

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.130 
less than the center of the screen if it
is<00:04:34.900> then<00:04:35.770> we<00:04:35.890> set<00:04:36.190> it<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.600> left<00:04:37.840> down

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
is then we set it to the left down

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.010 
is then we set it to the left down
because<00:04:39.240> somebody<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.300> tapped<00:04:40.630> on<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.810> left

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
because somebody is tapped on the left

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.680 
because somebody is tapped on the left
side<00:04:41.170> of<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.290> screen<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.820> we<00:04:42.820> subtract<00:04:43.360> some

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
side of the screen and we subtract some

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.720 
side of the screen and we subtract some
from<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.890> ball<00:04:45.550> X<00:04:46.210> velocity<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:47.190> then<00:04:48.190> if

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
from the ball X velocity and then if

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.490 
from the ball X velocity and then if
it's<00:04:49.390> not<00:04:49.570> on<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.900> left<00:04:50.110> side<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.440> screen

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
it's not on the left side of the screen

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.200 
it's not on the left side of the screen
we<00:04:50.680> know<00:04:50.890> it's<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.190> right<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.670> we<00:04:51.790> say<00:04:52.030> it's

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
we know it's on the right so we say it's

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.900 
we know it's on the right so we say it's
right<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.780> rights<00:04:52.990> down<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:54.310> add<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.760> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
right the rights down and we add to the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.700 
right the rights down and we add to the
X<00:04:55.240> velocity<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:57.750> now<00:04:58.750> what<00:04:58.900> we<00:04:59.050> need<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.320> do<00:04:59.470> is

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
X velocity so now what we need to do is

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.030 
X velocity so now what we need to do is
we<00:05:00.100> need<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.370> make<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:00.820> that<00:05:00.940> every<00:05:01.390> frame

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
we need to make it so that every frame

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.500 
we need to make it so that every frame
while<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.490> touch<00:05:03.730> is<00:05:03.970> down<00:05:05.940> we're<00:05:06.940> adding<00:05:07.180> or

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
while the touch is down we're adding or

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.160 
while the touch is down we're adding or
subtracting<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.380> velocity<00:05:09.930> so<00:05:10.930> then<00:05:11.080> we

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
subtracting to the velocity so then we

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.230 
subtracting to the velocity so then we
need<00:05:11.320> to<00:05:11.380> go<00:05:11.530> up<00:05:11.620> here<00:05:11.920> say<00:05:13.350> if<00:05:16.080> touch<00:05:17.080> state

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
need to go up here say if touch state

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:30.110 
need to go up here say if touch state
equals<00:05:19.240> K<00:05:20.130> left<00:05:21.130> down<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:24.090> ball<00:05:28.680> velocity<00:05:29.680> dot

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
equals K left down and ball velocity dot

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:42.740 
equals K left down and ball velocity dot
X<00:05:32.070> minus<00:05:33.070> equals<00:05:33.700> zero<00:05:34.630> point<00:05:34.900> two<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:39.840> if

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
X minus equals zero point two and if

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:52.010 
X minus equals zero point two and if
touch<00:05:43.750> state<00:05:44.080> equals<00:05:45.360> K<00:05:46.360> right<00:05:46.780> down<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:49.170> all

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
touch state equals K right down and all

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.900 
touch state equals K right down and all
velocity<00:05:53.340> X<00:05:56.340> plus<00:05:57.340> equals<00:05:57.820> zero<00:05:58.720> point<00:05:59.020> two

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
velocity X plus equals zero point two

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:07.650 
velocity X plus equals zero point two
and<00:06:00.910> I<00:06:01.890> put<00:06:02.890> these<00:06:03.010> in<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.280> wrong<00:06:03.400> spots<00:06:06.660> want

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
and I put these in the wrong spots want

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.440 
and I put these in the wrong spots want
to<00:06:07.750> put<00:06:07.870> them<00:06:08.020> up<00:06:08.170> here<00:06:08.940> because<00:06:09.940> we<00:06:10.240> want<00:06:10.390> to

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
to put them up here because we want to

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.210 
to put them up here because we want to
put<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:10.750> before<00:06:10.900> we<00:06:11.260> actually<00:06:11.500> position<00:06:12.130> the

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
put it before we actually position the

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.350 
put it before we actually position the
ball<00:06:13.050> and<00:06:14.050> we'll<00:06:14.290> try<00:06:14.470> to<00:06:14.530> run<00:06:14.710> that<00:06:14.830> quick<00:06:18.360> all

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
ball and we'll try to run that quick all

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.570 
ball and we'll try to run that quick all
right<00:06:19.510> and<00:06:19.690> so<00:06:20.230> the<00:06:20.410> ball<00:06:20.590> is<00:06:20.800> moving<00:06:20.830> back<00:06:21.400> and

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
right and so the ball is moving back and

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.320 
right and so the ball is moving back and
forth<00:06:21.780> as<00:06:23.280> we<00:06:24.280> push<00:06:24.520> on<00:06:24.640> either<00:06:24.790> side<00:06:25.090> and

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
forth as we push on either side and

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.620 
forth as we push on either side and
it'll<00:06:25.750> get<00:06:25.870> faster<00:06:26.380> as<00:06:26.530> you<00:06:26.560> hold<00:06:26.920> down<00:06:27.630> on

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
it'll get faster as you hold down on

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.840 
it'll get faster as you hold down on
either<00:06:28.750> side<00:06:30.720> but<00:06:32.220> still<00:06:33.220> it<00:06:33.490> doesn't<00:06:33.670> do

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
either side but still it doesn't do

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.810 
either side but still it doesn't do
anything<00:06:34.030> when<00:06:34.270> the<00:06:34.360> ball<00:06:34.480> falls<00:06:35.520> it<00:06:36.520> doesn't

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
anything when the ball falls it doesn't

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.850 
anything when the ball falls it doesn't
do<00:06:36.910> anything<00:06:37.180> when<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.420> ball<00:06:37.600> goes<00:06:37.780> up

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
do anything when the ball goes up

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.320 
do anything when the ball goes up
screen<00:06:39.069> or<00:06:39.310> when<00:06:39.490> it<00:06:39.580> goes<00:06:39.729> over<00:06:39.879> to<00:06:40.030> the<00:06:40.120> sides

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
screen or when it goes over to the sides

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.499 
screen or when it goes over to the sides
so<00:06:41.139> we'll<00:06:41.530> work<00:06:41.680> on<00:06:41.860> all<00:06:42.099> that<00:06:42.460> in<00:06:42.669> the<00:06:43.389> next

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
so we'll work on all that in the next

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.849 
so we'll work on all that in the next
tutorial<00:06:44.849> goodbye
