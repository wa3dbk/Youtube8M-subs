 coaches and business consultants for 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.520
 identify and combine the values 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.200
 fundamental interests and skills 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.330
 a person and linked with the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.100
 ideal business opportunities and 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.440
 experts who can help start 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.270
 those businesses are not only the first 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.860
 in developing this concept but that 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.780
 let's do the only service of this 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.400
 type in the market we believe that a 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.440
 service like this of global impact and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 attractive must have a method to 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.640
 spread your message on an equal scale 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.380
 or greater so instead of following the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.060
 traditional route of spending millions of 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.190
 dollars in advertising and marketing or 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.360
 pay google yahoo and bing to attract 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.310
 traffic to our website 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.290
 we decided to spend our budget 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.150
 marketing to incentivize and reward them 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.070
 you the first to believe in 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.930
 us to help us run the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.460
 voice are you aware of the impact that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.320
 have when I recommend restaurants 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.120
 movies applications games or 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.260
 Any other product that you can 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.000
 think that only a few people 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.640
 are interested in your recommendation 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.230
 but the reality is very different those 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.390
 people will probably tell you 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.340
 others and so on their impact 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.170
 indirect could go far beyond his 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.300
 imagination this mouth marketing to 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.370
 mouth is what we 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.050
 at your marketing reach and it's the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.580
 responsible for attracting thousands of new 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.260
 customers to businesses and the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.720
 generation of millions of dollars for 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.280
 them but what about you I imagined that 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.290
 the next time you get excited about a 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.030
 website a book or service tells you 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.040
 to six people if those six people 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.320
 just tell it to six others 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.600
 they could quickly become 36 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.860
 when the 36 tell you each of 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.380
 them to 6 other people 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.330
 the recommendation would reach 216 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.980
 people and if that pattern continues two 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.750
 levels plus your recommendation could 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.280
 reach more than seven thousand people from 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.990
 indirectly see how fast a 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.990
 handful of people can become
