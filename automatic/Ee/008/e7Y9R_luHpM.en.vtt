our<00:00:11.639> rotation<00:00:12.150> strategy<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.259> year<00:00:13.559> in

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
our rotation strategy is one year in

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.829 
our rotation strategy is one year in
high<00:00:14.009> value<00:00:14.400> vegetables<00:00:14.910> or<00:00:15.059> small<00:00:15.330> fruit<00:00:15.660> in

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
high value vegetables or small fruit in

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.779 
high value vegetables or small fruit in
our<00:00:16.020> case<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.500> strawberries<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.310> then<00:00:17.640> it's

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
our case it's strawberries and then it's

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.370 
our case it's strawberries and then it's
going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.060> followed<00:00:18.420> by<00:00:18.570> three<00:00:18.900> sometimes

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
going to be followed by three sometimes

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
going to be followed by three sometimes
four<00:00:19.500> years<00:00:19.980> where<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> ground<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.520> rotated

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
four years where the ground is rotated

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.150 
four years where the ground is rotated
out<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.260> effect<00:00:22.380> we're<00:00:22.769> only<00:00:22.890> farming

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
out so in effect we're only farming

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.400 
out so in effect we're only farming
about<00:00:23.519> twenty<00:00:23.910> percent<00:00:23.939> each<00:00:24.660> year<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.260> our

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
about twenty percent each year of our

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.150 
about twenty percent each year of our
total<00:00:25.680> 80<00:00:26.189> acres<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:28.099> implemented<00:00:29.099> this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
total 80 acres I implemented this

rotation<00:00:29.760> back<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.230> 1987<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.679> at<00:00:31.949> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
rotation back in 1987 and I know at that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
rotation back in 1987 and I know at that
time<00:00:32.130> some<00:00:32.640> farmers<00:00:33.120> thought<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.450> was<00:00:33.600> crazy

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
time some farmers thought it was crazy

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
time some farmers thought it was crazy
to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.410> resting<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.070> much<00:00:35.340> ground<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.180> an

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to be resting that much ground in an

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.389 
to be resting that much ground in an
area<00:00:36.480> where<00:00:36.750> there's<00:00:36.960> high<00:00:36.989> land<00:00:37.410> values<00:00:37.829> but

area where there's high land values but
over<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> years<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.969> realized<00:00:39.420> some<00:00:39.600> real

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
over the years I realized some real

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.500 
over the years I realized some real
benefits<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:41.040> pest<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.149> disease

benefits we see pest and disease

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
benefits we see pest and disease
pressure<00:00:43.079> remain<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> manageable<00:00:44.190> levels<00:00:44.610> the

pressure remain in manageable levels the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
pressure remain in manageable levels the
soil<00:00:45.390> fertility<00:00:45.690> has<00:00:45.930> gone<00:00:46.140> way<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.860> stuff

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
soil fertility has gone way up and stuff

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.160

grows<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:48.000> better<00:00:48.239> simply<00:00:48.719> by<00:00:48.840> prepping

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
grows a lot better simply by prepping

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
grows a lot better simply by prepping
that<00:00:49.469> ground<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.010> between<00:00:50.430> those<00:00:50.610> high<00:00:50.789> value

that ground in between those high value

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750 
that ground in between those high value
crops<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:52.010> think<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.160> important<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> note

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
crops I think it's important to note

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
crops I think it's important to note
that<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.000> eighty<00:00:54.300> percent<00:00:54.390> its<00:00:54.989> setting

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that that eighty percent its setting

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.350 
that that eighty percent its setting
foul<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.309> laying<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:56.910> idly

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
foul is not just laying out there idly

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
foul is not just laying out there idly
growing<00:00:57.690> weeds<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.350> being<00:00:58.800> rested<00:00:59.370> by

growing weeds it's being rested by

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.729 
growing weeds it's being rested by

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
make the ground in much better shape so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.760 
make the ground in much better shape so
it's<00:01:09.720> easier<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> grow<00:01:10.260> bigger<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.619> better

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it's easier to grow bigger and better

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's easier to grow bigger and better
crops<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.430> each<00:01:11.610> passing<00:01:12.030> year<00:01:12.830> for<00:01:13.830> us

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
crops which each passing year for us

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340 
crops which each passing year for us
when<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> vegetable<00:01:15.150> crop<00:01:15.390> comes<00:01:15.750> out<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.110> small

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
when a vegetable crop comes out or small

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
when a vegetable crop comes out or small
fruit<00:01:16.650> crop<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.490> immediately<00:01:17.820> thinking

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
fruit crop I'm immediately thinking

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.179 
fruit crop I'm immediately thinking
three<00:01:18.869> four<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.259> five<00:01:19.439> years<00:01:19.470> down<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.159> road

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
three four or five years down the road

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.580 
three four or five years down the road
and<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> try<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> implement<00:01:22.290> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and what I try to do is implement that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
and what I try to do is implement that
rotation<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.580> ground<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.509> much

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
rotation so that ground will be in much

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.499 
rotation so that ground will be in much
better<00:01:24.720> condition<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.920> starts<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
better condition it starts by when the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.780 
better condition it starts by when the
crop<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.900> finished<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.409> simply<00:01:29.070> leaf<00:01:29.310> mulching

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
crop is finished is simply leaf mulching

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.999 
crop is finished is simply leaf mulching
