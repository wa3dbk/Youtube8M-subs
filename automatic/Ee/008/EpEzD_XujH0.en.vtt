00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.330
 well we're all here Kim Jong 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.090
 craig and we're going to bring the changes that 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.999
 they are going to put in the good pp they are already 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.669
 inside and that they are going to leave the server in 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.160
 I live today when they take out to trace the new 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.230
 champion you know well let's go with evelyn 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.690
 that he has touched several things the most 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.290
 fucked in the ultimate but let's go 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.670
 part evelyn before had life base 462 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.860
 more 82 then levels and now it's going to have 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.469
 470 plus 90 per level as you see there says 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.769
 Well, it has a little more life 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:38.839
 afterwards yes and apart they have undone the baby 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:43.070
 ugly that they did to the one who was 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:45.260
 climbing to do 45 dea ida and what 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.829
 they put to 0.4 well again now it's 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.800
 at 0 with 45 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.620
 the ugly the last you the last you now 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.810
 does not hurt in percentage to life 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.480
 maximum 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:02.180
 but in percentage to current life it is worth 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.809
 So, that's a good day, but 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.809
 does not go na 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.890
 we have the catarina here another champion 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.380
 that is going to be retouched that you have downloaded 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.380
 the movement speed instead of 350 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.780
 is going to have 345 and has over here we have 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.970
 change 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.950
 and is that the w will now give less 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.010
 Movement speed when you hit 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.050
 someone 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.390
 before it gave 12 20 28 36 44% the truth 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.600
 that there is a lot is another out of doubt and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.620
 now 15 20 25 30 35 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.980
 it's acceptable and it's still pretty 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.950
 we go with the following 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.670
 the next one is 3 the new champion who 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 they have taken out 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.650
 They have made the change out of you 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.899
 have made a plan that they have 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.970
 out of anxiety because before I had to 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.400
 life regeneration nine every five 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.050
 seconds that's pretty 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.390
 but it was that I had regeneration of 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.910
 mana 8.5 is worth another mission quite and 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.020
 is that now will have regeneration 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.700
 of life 6 in 20 9 and so 5 instead 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.380
 of 8 with a 5 or as you see 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.060
 they put the numbers the tonton and says 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.180
 well we will adapt it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.040
 and it has because more change the w of 3 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.710
 before it lasted six seconds when 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.140
 when he had the shield 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.350
 but now now lasts 4 seconds on 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.000
 shield 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 I'm second the truth is that it was 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.520
 pretty but good 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.680
 they have also changed the last t 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.720
 and is that the last I pull three in 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.610
 time to paste 450 berbegal 550 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.760
 let's go with the next champion that 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.910
 is a nor did they retouch the shield 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.650
 a month or so more or less and now what 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.450
 what they are going to do is that the average shield 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.220
 lasts six seconds lasts five times 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.140
 the truth that the shields that last longer 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.750
 five seconds france 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.340
 he does not see but they are above what 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.620
 normal 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.080
 it is the only change an and we go with corky 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.540
 and is that now the core that was going to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.240
 cost less bad thing that I think 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.490
 well because 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.290
 between the cv and the 'my mother' any 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.359
 it mana ruins 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:34.250
 and it cost him 60 70 80 90 and 100 mana and 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.920
 now it will cost 60 65 70 75 and 80 of 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.520
 way 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.110
 as you see systems life, it would cost you 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.400
 rather less handling 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.849
 let's go with the next 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.290
 is morgan and morgan now they have made a 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.690
 retouch that I do not like because 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.380
 because it's not worth 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.660
 basically before when 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.720
 of this nothing when I left you 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.520
 incapacitated if he was rank one was a 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.340
 second to the range of a second and a half and 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.510
 now not 32 then now to all the rank 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.510
 it's a second and a half 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800
 and we are going with rice that are changing 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.519
 looking for things 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:23.050
 removing others and we have the q in the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.900
 how much was climbing to demand 5.5 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.630
 root maximum and now it will be 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.630
 scaled to 6.5 percent let's 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.300
 but now the w instead of being scale 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.449
 25 percent maximum is not going to be 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.689
 scaled to 4.5 percent 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.710
 and instead of being scaled to 0 with 4 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.589
 coffee will be scaled steel with 35 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.510
 as you see and if they look for something 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:54.840
 keep trying to keep the balance 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.320
 Well I hope you have been helpful and 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.570
 good the utility 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.300
 this data about what they are going to put 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.390
 prontito and nothing because there is favorite 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.430
 all those things that help a lot and we 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.430
 we see soon now
