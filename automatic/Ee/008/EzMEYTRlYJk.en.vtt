floor

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610

but<00:00:38.430> today<00:00:39.000> we're<00:00:39.150> gonna<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.390> looking<00:00:39.750> at<00:00:40.019> what

but today we're gonna be looking at what

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.430 
but today we're gonna be looking at what
I<00:00:40.650> think<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.220> be<00:00:41.339> the<00:00:41.370> selling<00:00:42.120> point<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I think to be the selling point and the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
I think to be the selling point and the
reason<00:00:43.769> to<00:00:43.829> pick<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.159> this<00:00:44.339> set<00:00:44.640> we're<00:00:45.239> going

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
reason to pick up this set we're going

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.410 
reason to pick up this set we're going
to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.480> looking<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:46.100> ventriloquist<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
to be looking at ventriloquist and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.729 
to be looking at ventriloquist and
Scarface<00:00:50.120> very<00:00:51.120> neat<00:00:51.329> figure<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.960> would<00:00:52.500> say

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
Scarface very neat figure I would say

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.609 
Scarface very neat figure I would say
the<00:00:52.949> ventriloquist<00:00:53.460> stayed<00:00:54.269> pretty<00:00:54.540> close<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
the ventriloquist stayed pretty close to

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.390 
the ventriloquist stayed pretty close to
the<00:00:55.890> Batman<00:00:56.430> animated<00:00:56.670> series<00:00:57.420> cartoon

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
the Batman animated series cartoon

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.939 
the Batman animated series cartoon
version<00:00:59.400> of<00:00:59.489> him<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.839> ventriloquist<00:01:01.290> pretty

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
version of him the ventriloquist pretty

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.060 
version of him the ventriloquist pretty
much<00:01:02.839> pretty<00:01:03.839> much<00:01:04.049> looks<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> same<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.920> mean

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
much pretty much looks the same I mean

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.280 
much pretty much looks the same I mean
it's<00:01:05.460> got<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.670> ease<00:01:06.060> bawling<00:01:06.689> he's<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it's got the ease bawling he's got the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.940 
it's got the ease bawling he's got the
glasses

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
glasses

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.460 
glasses
obviously<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:09.000> ventriloquist<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> little

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
obviously this ventriloquist is a little

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.789 
obviously this ventriloquist is a little
more<00:01:11.150> stylized<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.600> think<00:01:12.930> than<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.259> animated

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
more stylized I think than the animated

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.359 
more stylized I think than the animated
series<00:01:15.380> voice<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.950> same<00:01:17.159> though<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
series voice is about the same though I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
series voice is about the same though I
don't<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.790> don't<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.570> actors<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
don't I don't know the actors that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.670 
don't I don't know the actors that
portrayed<00:01:19.860> them<00:01:23.630> yeah<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
portrayed them yeah I think what do I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.120 
portrayed them yeah I think what do I
think<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.659> guy<00:01:27.840> from<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.260> re-animator

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
think it's the guy from the re-animator

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
think it's the guy from the re-animator
that<00:01:29.520> did<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> voice<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:31.020> animated

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that did the voice in the animated

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
that did the voice in the animated
series<00:01:31.620> I<00:01:32.100> don't<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.850> name<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.300> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
series I don't know the name the the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.810 
series I don't know the name the the
actor<00:01:34.140> who<00:01:34.290> did<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> voice<00:01:34.590> event<00:01:35.310> well<00:01:35.490> quest

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
actor who did the voice event well quest

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.390 
actor who did the voice event well quest
in<00:01:36.090> Batman<00:01:36.720> though<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> Batman

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
in Batman though or in the Batman

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.360 
in Batman though or in the Batman
cartoon<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
cartoon but I think the I think the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.160 
cartoon but I think the I think the
figure<00:01:41.700> does<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.940> good<00:01:42.150> job<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:43.490> representing

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
figure does a good job of representing

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.360 
figure does a good job of representing
you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.260> representing<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> ventriloquist

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
you know representing the ventriloquist

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.190 
you know representing the ventriloquist
dude<00:01:47.760> he<00:01:47.940> does<00:01:48.150> look<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
dude he does look a lot like the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.130 
dude he does look a lot like the
character<00:01:49.590> from<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.010> cartoon<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:51.630> think

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
character from the cartoon I think

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440 
character from the cartoon I think
Scarface<00:01:52.620> looks<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.130> lot<00:01:53.400> like<00:01:53.670> Scarface<00:01:54.060> as

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
Scarface looks a lot like Scarface as

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.370 
Scarface looks a lot like Scarface as
well<00:01:54.650> that<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.010> problem<00:01:56.370> I<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.760> with

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
well that the one problem I have with

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.090 
well that the one problem I have with
this<00:01:58.380> figure<00:01:59.240> and<00:02:00.240> I'll<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.570> take<00:02:01.100> Scarface

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this figure and I'll just take Scarface

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
this figure and I'll just take Scarface
off<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.850> Scarface<00:02:03.360> has<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
off as you can see Scarface has just a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.289 
off as you can see Scarface has just a
hole<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.290> his<00:02:04.440> back<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.940> ventriloquist

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
hole in his back and the ventriloquist

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.889 
hole in his back and the ventriloquist
doesn't<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> hand<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:07.830> just<00:02:07.860> has<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> peg

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
doesn't have a hand but just has a peg

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.899 
doesn't have a hand but just has a peg
so<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.019> downside<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.799> can<00:02:10.979> take<00:02:11.670> off

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
so the downside is you can take off

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.600 
so the downside is you can take off
Scarface<00:02:12.810> but<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.769> you're<00:02:13.920> gonna<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.340> old

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
Scarface but then you're gonna have old

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.339 
Scarface but then you're gonna have old
peg<00:02:15.030> arm<00:02:15.269> then<00:02:15.690> ventriloquist<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:18.349> think

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
peg arm then ventriloquist here I think

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.960 
peg arm then ventriloquist here I think
the<00:02:19.439> one<00:02:19.470> problem<00:02:20.189> I<00:02:20.280> had<00:02:21.439> with<00:02:22.439> the<00:02:23.129> Scarface

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the one problem I had with the Scarface

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.920 
the one problem I had with the Scarface
from<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.420> Batman<00:02:24.810> cartoon<00:02:25.110> rather<00:02:26.040> than<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
from the Batman cartoon rather than the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.280 
from the Batman cartoon rather than the
actually<00:02:27.930> laying<00:02:28.110> down<00:02:28.379> here

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
actually laying down here

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.290 
actually laying down here
with<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:30.070> cartoon<00:02:30.400> rather<00:02:30.910> than<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
with this cartoon rather than the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.770 
with this cartoon rather than the
animated<00:02:31.750> series<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:33.060> wasn't<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.120> big<00:02:34.330> fan<00:02:34.360> of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
animated series I wasn't a big fan of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.260 
animated series I wasn't a big fan of
this<00:02:35.260> particular<00:02:35.680> look<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.430> Scarface<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.120> mean

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
this particular look of Scarface I mean

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.200 
this particular look of Scarface I mean
clearly<00:02:37.630> they're<00:02:38.470> trying<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:38.980> with<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.580> Al

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
clearly they're trying to go with the Al

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
almost see whenever I think of Scarface

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.860 
almost see whenever I think of Scarface
I<00:02:55.750> always<00:02:55.900> think<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:57.280> mob<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.030> know

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
I always think of the the mob you know

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.310 
I always think of the the mob you know
the<00:02:59.200> old<00:02:59.410> 30s<00:02:59.980> look<00:03:00.790> mob<00:03:01.540> boss<00:03:01.840> kind<00:03:02.170> of

the old 30s look mob boss kind of

Scarface<00:03:02.770> from<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.070> animated<00:03:03.460> series<00:03:03.640> line<00:03:04.060> I

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
Scarface from the animated series line I

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.990 
Scarface from the animated series line I
found<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.650> scarf<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.220> little<00:03:06.610> harder<00:03:06.910> to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
found this scarf is a little harder to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.990 
found this scarf is a little harder to
get<00:03:07.090> used<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:08.950> it's<00:03:09.280> just<00:03:09.610> my<00:03:09.760> own

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
get used to but it's it's just my own

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.020 
get used to but it's it's just my own
preference<00:03:10.330> really<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:12.040> we'll<00:03:12.160> put<00:03:12.430> we'll

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
preference really but we'll put we'll

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.760 
preference really but we'll put we'll
put<00:03:13.380> Scarface<00:03:14.380> back<00:03:14.650> into<00:03:15.640> his<00:03:15.760> hand<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.770> the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
put Scarface back into his hand here the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.790 
put Scarface back into his hand here the
one<00:03:17.920> downside<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:18.730> find<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:20.320> haven't<00:03:20.680> had

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
one downside to I find and I haven't had

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.950 
one downside to I find and I haven't had
this<00:03:20.980> figure<00:03:21.250> out<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.640> often<00:03:22.240> I<00:03:22.390> took<00:03:22.840> him

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
this figure out very often I took him

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.590 
this figure out very often I took him
out<00:03:23.080> once<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.710> kind<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:23.950> look<00:03:24.130> at<00:03:24.310> him<00:03:24.600> but

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
out once just to kind of look at him but

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.260 
out once just to kind of look at him but
I<00:03:25.630> find<00:03:25.990> his<00:03:26.200> elbow<00:03:26.740> is<00:03:27.010> getting<00:03:27.790> really<00:03:28.030> loose

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
I find his elbow is getting really loose

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.540 
I find his elbow is getting really loose
and<00:03:28.660> it's<00:03:28.960> just<00:03:29.140> because<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.680> fact<00:03:30.280> he<00:03:30.400> has

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
and it's just because of the fact he has

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.890 
and it's just because of the fact he has
to<00:03:30.730> hold<00:03:31.030> up<00:03:31.270> Scarface

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
to hold up Scarface
