00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
other than the style it's quite faded so
you<00:00:25.859> know<00:00:26.189> after<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.029> two<00:00:27.240> months<00:00:27.510> of

you know after kind of two months of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.810 
you know after kind of two months of
wearing<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.470> does<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:29.070> very<00:00:29.340> kind<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
wearing it it does go very kind of a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479 
wearing it it does go very kind of a
lightish<00:00:30.359> rose<00:00:31.199> color<00:00:31.619> which<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.099> think<00:00:32.309> can

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
lightish rose color which I think can

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
lightish rose color which I think can
look<00:00:32.669> quite<00:00:32.870> unprofessional<00:00:33.870> because<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
look quite unprofessional because it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380 
look quite unprofessional because it
looks<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.680> uniform<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> worn<00:00:35.670> out

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
looks like your uniform is worn out

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.619 
looks like your uniform is worn out
I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.230> durability<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.340> concern<00:00:38.850> at

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
I think the durability is a concern at

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.260 
I think the durability is a concern at
times<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.489> uniforms<00:00:41.489> washing<00:00:41.879> day-in

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
right up on the side so the problem with

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
right up on the side so the problem with
the<00:01:16.080> current<00:01:16.259> red<00:01:16.619> uniform<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the current red uniform would be the the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
the current red uniform would be the the
color<00:01:18.479> obviously<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> also<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.070> not

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
color obviously and also that it's not

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
color obviously and also that it's not
made<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.670> fit<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.090> body<00:01:21.270> shapes<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:22.500> the
