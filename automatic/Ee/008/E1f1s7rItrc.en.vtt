obviously the track record he has and it
was<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> kind<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.790> like<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:10.940> no-brainer<00:02:11.090> where<00:02:11.570> we

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
was a kind of like a no-brainer where we

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.080 
was a kind of like a no-brainer where we
wanted<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.960> go<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.500> as<00:02:13.040> long<00:02:13.550> as<00:02:13.640> they<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:13.940> get
