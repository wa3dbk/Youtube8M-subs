00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello dear and so constantly new video of me what the here on one 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.840
 Channel Bastian Moore's like humor, so to speak, of videos that are easy on the 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.459
 Point you can touch us 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.469
 and delivers awoke wishing to present Elton 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.279
 Here it goes as the title says to a quarter of a million of my first 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.199
 Movie role Mio and it goes in the movie "Harry Potter and the sanctuaries 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.409
 of death 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.800
 So who has not seen this movie yet 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520
 and would like to have no information on these cases, which should be on 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.110
 best shut down because percent no longer fell to the overall profit of the movie 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 I liked it a lot 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.800
 and in the year so 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.020
 switch off now if you do not want that you want or just 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.380
 stay tuned if you are interested in how to find 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.640
 Of course I have the book "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.780
 to the film also read here at 7 a very very exciting book I find and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.970
 I have to say that Harry Potter is accompanying me with a delay 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.940
 so all together i'm kind of growing up with Hey this is very very cool because 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.940
 the whole thing has been dating for more than ten years and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.590
 I have to say that we are part 1 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.450
 from the seventh for the very much liked it was very exciting Harry 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.260
 Potter has nothing to do with children anymore and Dr 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.320
 It was partly really scary I have to say 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 So I was really very good 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.200
 From time to time you could relax a bit because there was a bit 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.530
 quieter are there 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.440
 Sewage was particularly noticed 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.130
 how are the landscapes in this movie Dr madness 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.979
 For example, Vincenco's table was shot around with it really 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.689
 impressed the filming locations are the super selected and also the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.990
 Prince William soon so far that they got the ministry right the league exactly like that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.650
 presented a bit on 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.619
 and there were some scenes where I was very scared 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 which surprised me a bit 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 that, for example, the silver wedding 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.800
 which was given in Schmela percent indicated in Schwerin where mine 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.790
 betvictor com and Hans 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.370
 that this scene does not occur in the first part comes the first in the 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.800
 second part 4 I can not imagine because the wedding celebration on 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.209
 first part of volume 7 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.979
 and for the 7 and around 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.979
 that's 700 we feel that way either 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.809
 I misunderstood something 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.419
 which was also funny when I was in the movie, there was no break 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.989
 the Cablecom short form 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.409
 Good things went so fast, says one 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.409
 and around 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.940
 also the scene was from 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.400
 Hermione was conjured unrecognizable and so receives this swollen face 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.949
 that was very cool that made 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.619
 Pregnant scenes where the seven Harry's make changes to 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.420
 House of 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.900
 Policies to get to the Burrow I liked that very much 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.089
 I am already looking forward to the second part of the movie, which will take place in the summer 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.580
 Will be released in 2011 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.680
 and of course I'll buy the Blue when the movie comes out now 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.480
 Guess wild too big then comes out 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.789
 but that must surprise 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.879
 So all in all she has said with this movie very much Harry Potter 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.879
 and the Order of the Phoenix was my favorite movie the first three parts 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.309
 the FIFA fan is not so good 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:21.999
 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince "was also very good, but this tendency must be 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.619
 I really liked it 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.809
 It is a pity that Professor Dahmen Tor 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.749
 Jean Todt is it is so she learns me a lot this movie I have to say 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.839
 around 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.049
 the figure of this type father replacement betrays 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.919
 Classic and you realize it's no kid anymore and that's all now 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.829
 just got very very mature 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.849
 Hermione is also playing this beautiful movie I really like it 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.820
 very cool the scenes between her and pipes 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.110
 when you were cut off again so came with this general 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.989
 All in all a very dark movie very exciting 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.839
 sometimes also shopping and lingering really a few 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.589
 10 are where you are easy 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.379
 very scares meetings at least that way 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.559
 and here Lisa has been waiting for that was so my my thoughts on the movie 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.989
 because something else should be written he writes it comes if we this video too 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.379
 Sell ​​by the way and if you have already seen this movie then 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.759
 Of course I want to know 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.290
 how did you like write a comment below 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.390
 what did you like most about this movie? 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.409
 which role did she find the best 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.499
 and is there anything she does not like so much 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.379
 maybe even discovered it for the mistake that interests me 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:30.180
 always 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 in the last 15 years some 5er originated 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.379
 Where 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.980
 People from the film crew were seen in the movie where strong Nico was in front of me 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.289
 or how hot these names are 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.819
 Percent in the picture came damage in the windows to be seen by the camera crew 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.940
 yes that's not easy to know thank you guys that he's off shop the signals 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.050
 so if the parents see it soon, I wish you much fun 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.729
 Movie 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.069
 and yes it has to and what will look then
