00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.310
 hello welcome to the animal list with 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.690
 alexandra youtuber below the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.320
 next topic 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.089
 tiger versus lion no doubt a very fight 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.849
 epic that has never reached death 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.980
 but that it would be very wild being that 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.650
 in their habitat both animals are the ones 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.689
 reign the tiger can weigh more than the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.150
 lion at first glance we would think that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.490
 it was the opposite but not this 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.890
 Maybe it's because the lion has mane it 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.230
 that makes it look a bit more robust 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.390
 both have advantages and disadvantages but 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.320
 they are not as significant as being in 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.649
 the battlefield 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.030
 first of all we will talk about the lion this one 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.190
 It is an animal that lives among 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.110
 pastures and savannas so it's very 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.420
 fierce because he fights with animals 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.239
 much bigger than him so he learns to 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.579
 be fast and agile one of its advantages in 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.710
 a fight would be that he has mane so 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.570
 that at a certain point protects it also 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.340
 has the advantage of being smart to the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.230
 time to attack and do not waste the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.109
 energy that he has, he thinks very well 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.390
 your movements now we will talk 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.979
 of the tiger this lives more in forests and 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.840
 sheets so what is his is 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.640
 face faster animals and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.890
 smaller size to him 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.390
 but that's not a disadvantage at the time 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.000
 to face some animal of his 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.710
 size as is the lion one of the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.260
 qualities of the tiger is that it has more 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.880
 weight that your opponent and also has more 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.159
 force when launching pazos 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.500
 being able to knock out his rival with 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.090
 few well - aimed blows on his face 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.070
 weakness is that it requires more 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.780
 effort when fighting because it has 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.090
 more muscles in the legs what 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.520
 the fight needs more resistance 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.400
 It would be very even as they both have 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.110
 an almost equal weight and powerful muzzle but 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.750
 the tiger has more power in its legs or 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 claws so he would surely beat him 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.070
 to your opponent with less hits with your 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.320
 claws instead the lion has the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.020
 claws less precise what would 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.880
 lose so the tiger would win this 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.220
 combat that would surely last 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.460
 long minutes or hours you think 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.899
 correct you for whom you would bet
