Thursday<00:00:20.070> October<00:00:20.699> 10th<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
Thursday October 10th I think that the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.009 
Thursday October 10th I think that the
dreams<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.789> big<00:00:24.330> part<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
dreams here really are a big part of the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.859 
dreams here really are a big part of the
picture<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.039> neptune<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.880> over<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> map

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
picture we have neptune all over the map

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.009 
picture we have neptune all over the map
today<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.119> place<00:00:30.449> but

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
today it's like it's in one place but

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
today it's like it's in one place but
it's<00:00:31.230> everywhere<00:00:31.740> well<00:00:32.040> neptune<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's everywhere well neptune is the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.709 
it's everywhere well neptune is the
planet<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.630> fantasy<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> yet<00:00:35.520> fantasy<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.239> not

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
planet of fantasy and yet fantasy is not

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.600 
planet of fantasy and yet fantasy is not
just<00:00:37.110> an<00:00:37.260> escape<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.040> also<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.399> an

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
just an escape it can also be an

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.729 
just an escape it can also be an
inspiration<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.719> certainly<00:00:39.989> start<00:00:40.559> out

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
inspiration and we certainly start out

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.610 
inspiration and we certainly start out
with<00:00:41.309> romantic<00:00:41.879> fantasy<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> artistic

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
with romantic fantasy the artistic

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.830 
with romantic fantasy the artistic
creativity<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.210> social<00:00:45.390> vulnerability

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
creativity or the social vulnerability

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.369 
creativity or the social vulnerability
of<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.739> Venus<00:00:47.100> Neptune<00:00:47.489> square<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.239> morning

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
of a Venus Neptune square this morning

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
of a Venus Neptune square this morning
right<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.430> long<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.789> we

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
right and I think that as long as we

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.689 
right and I think that as long as we
understand<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.840> fantasy<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:53.010> illusion

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
understand that fantasy or illusion

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.010 
understand that fantasy or illusion
doesn't<00:00:54.000> even<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.480> something<00:00:54.780> that's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
doesn't even have to be something that's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
doesn't even have to be something that's
wrong<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.309> has<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.640> something<00:00:56.910> based

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
wrong it just has to be something based

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.099 
wrong it just has to be something based
upon<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.079> dream<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> wish<00:00:59.370> fulfillment<00:00:59.579> and

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
upon a dream or a wish fulfillment and

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.850 
upon a dream or a wish fulfillment and
it<00:01:01.109> actually<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.570> tracks<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.799> are

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it actually can be the tracks that are

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.090 
it actually can be the tracks that are
followed<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:05.670> realities<00:01:06.570> train<00:01:06.930> later<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
followed by realities train later on and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.789 
followed by realities train later on and
today<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> realistic<00:01:09.840> train<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.650> have

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
today we have a realistic train we have

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
today we have a realistic train we have
the<00:01:11.010> moon<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.790> moving<00:01:12.330> into<00:01:12.600> realistic

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the moon that is moving into realistic

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.530 
the moon that is moving into realistic
Capricorn<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.610> focus<00:01:15.180> on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
Capricorn that really can focus on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.010 
Capricorn that really can focus on
what's<00:01:15.810> real<00:01:16.110> even<00:01:16.830> though<00:01:17.040> we're<00:01:17.520> often

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
what's real even though we're often

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
what's real even though we're often
dreamland<00:01:19.020> yeah<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> moon<00:01:19.830> sets<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.909> mood<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
dreamland yeah the moon sets the mood it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.230 
dreamland yeah the moon sets the mood it
establishes<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.710> emotional<00:01:23.340> framework<00:01:23.970> of

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
establishes the emotional framework of

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
establishes the emotional framework of
the<00:01:24.479> day<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.170> gathering<00:01:25.409> force<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the day it's a gathering force and the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
the day it's a gathering force and the
moon<00:01:26.790> enters<00:01:27.259> hard-nosed<00:01:28.369> responsible

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
moon enters hard-nosed responsible

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.910 
moon enters hard-nosed responsible
Capricorn<00:01:30.119> today<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> sometimes<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
Capricorn today and I sometimes think of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.910 
Capricorn today and I sometimes think of
Capricorn<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> sign<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.840> has<00:01:34.380> only<00:01:34.530> one

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
Capricorn as a sign that has only one

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100 
Capricorn as a sign that has only one
talent<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.579> that's<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.210> ability<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.840> work

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
talent and that's the ability to work

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
talent and that's the ability to work
hard<00:01:37.590> enough<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.520> done<00:01:38.759> whatever<00:01:39.090> needs

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
hard enough to get done whatever needs

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
hard enough to get done whatever needs
to<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.750> done<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.350> today<00:01:40.979> there's<00:01:41.369> plenty<00:01:42.000> to
