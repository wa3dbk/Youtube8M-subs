 everyone who wants to equip his ship with 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.020
 produced in china 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.530

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.960
 ram bumblebee briefly about technical 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.119
 characteristics of the new bumblebee 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.500
 four-stroke carburetor engine with 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.300
 air cooled 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.480
 weight is only eight kilos working volume 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.570
 35.8 cubic centimeters capacity 1 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.580
 point six horsepower volume 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.440
 fuel tank 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.379
 650 milliliter crankcase capacity 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.780
 print out the box itself box except 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.760
 engine will be removed block 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.220
 transom mount rich set 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.680
 tool electric motor he also 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.570
 surprisingly easy let's compare it 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.700
 real weight stated in passport 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.270
 manufacturer really 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.550
 8 kilograms for the basis of the power unit 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.080
 was behind the engine about sex 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.790
 development has already passed pre-sale 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.640
 training at the company station 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.310
 maintenance where was checked and if 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.530
 it was necessary adjusted after 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.060
 this crankcase oil was holy 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.590
 this must be remembered and not forgotten 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.750
 pour oil before use 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.540
 pour put 95 milliliters of oil 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.550
 for 4-stroke engines 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.960
 manufacturer recommends oil grade 10 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.540
 at 30 the amount of oil in the crankcase can 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.480
 check the level using it 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.690
 must be within 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.120
 fill in the appropriate mark 650 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.950
 milliliters of gasoline no problem how 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.680
 case with 2 mixing techniques 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.630
 gasoline oil mixture just pour 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.040
 gasoline in the tank and the engine is ready for 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.530
 operating access air filter 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.840
 in case you need to clean 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.850
 implemented as simply and reliably 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.020
 open the lid and paralon filter 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.680
 before us as for the elements 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.350
 of management 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.000
 gas adjustment is carried out on the handle 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.670
 vrubela another plus in the piggy bank bumblebee 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.260
 motor as it should be equipped with a button 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.510
 engine stops but here is located 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.320
 she in our opinion is not enough 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.000
 conveniently provided for in the motor 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.209
 the ability to change the angle 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.010
 tiller it will add convenience as 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.970
 boat control and at 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.040
 motor transportation screw produced 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.080
 durable plastic which is the norm 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.590
 for few strong engines for many 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.630
 world famous brands 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.700
 engine gearbox has a volume of 80 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.160
 milliliters and serviced according to the principle 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.739
 used in conventional boat motors 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.340
 there is a hole for filling the gearbox 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.709
 and to drain the oil the foot of the bumblebee has 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.810
 free play allowing you to lead without 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.740
 any effort to raise the engine on the go for 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.160
 revisions and 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.510
 so and if you need to force 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.940
 move the boat in the opposite direction 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.890
 then this you can do deployed 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.050
 180 degree motor 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.060
 note that when turning 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.610
 motor fixing legs in 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.290
 special locks to her when 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.290
 progasovke days exploded out of the water 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.180
 restart pump gasoline and ask 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 possession of our charming captain 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.570
 start a bumblebee 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.430
 many expect some problems with 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.730
 first acquaintance with the Chinese technology 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.470
 but in this case the engine started right away 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.080
 that really was delighted and 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.790
 and it is at this very moment many of you 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.890
 surely grabs his head and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.140
 remember that the motor should be 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.330
 submerged in order to work 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.890
 water cooling ask you 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.840
 calm down all right 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.780
 the engine is equipped with an air system 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.910
 cooling detail about it, we will tell 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.670
 later when we get down to testing 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.800
 water in a boat motor bumblebee 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.830
 technology that was previously used 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.600
 you and I were unfamiliar 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.730
 centrifugal clutch and this 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.980
 means that at low clutch speeds 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.130
 not happening and wing as a consequence not 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.750
 rotates so interestingly realized 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.170
 neutral gear cannot 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.420
 boast even eminent malossi 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.280
 boat motors and here is the first part 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.100
 made a bumblebee set on a boat transom 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.580
 as you see Vladislav with ease 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.320
 cope with this task in a way for 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.970
 tests we took one of the most 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.300
 popular rowing boats 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.720
 280 fitted park 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.730
 np 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.530
 1.6 horsepower and 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.530
 enough to forget about 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.500
 spring but how it is clear to all hope 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.740
 at supersonic speed useless you 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.169
 to the bottom boat 2.8 meters long with donkeys 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.720
 you are driven by our experienced flooring 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.210
 captain the bumblebee dispersed to seven 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.460
 kilometers per hour for cleanliness 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.230
 experiment we plant a sip of one more 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.630
 passenger 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.730
 what can be said for sure on the oars 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.250
 you do not accelerate a bumblebee 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.230
 store captain 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.560
 you will spend yours only for carrying 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.410
 motor from the car boat result 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.460
 speed is about the same as with one 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.270
 man on board 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.550
 7 kilometers per hour and another one is about 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.890
 Testing immediately sprinkle line spire 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.440
 sales managers store captain her 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.290
 start not at slow speed 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.650
 the bumblebee noise level was 80 doors 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.970
 was 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.530
 and at maximum 102 so air 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.220
 cooling about which we have repeatedly 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.870
 mentioned what advantages she gives us you 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.760
 ever stranded in a boat 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.950
 when you urgently need to raise the motor 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.020
 not to damage win pe gear 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.760
 Now you can not worry about what 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.370
 you forgot to turn off the engine with it 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.230
 nothing will happen or for example you 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.570
 feel navi wound up 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.240
 it needs to be cleaned no problems 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.710
 raised the motor to spin living air and 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.290
 let's move on 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.230
 as for fuel consumption 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.270
 four stroke means economical for 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.910
 filming time we tortured a little more 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.370
 half tank can be compared by 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.490
 about the size of a small bottle 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.490
 of beer 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.690
 at the end of our test drive we decided 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.810
 rearrange the bumblebee on the boat in which 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.700
 our operator Alena worked incredibly 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.950
 but two passengers take you to the bottom of the boat 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.190
 3 meters long 30 centimeters 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.670
 Hummingbird model 330 with stationary 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.920
 transom 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.110
 this kid broke up to the same speed 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.770
 which is the case with the transom boat 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.770
 7 km
