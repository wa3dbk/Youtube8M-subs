nickels now if you have a look at this

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.770 
nickels now if you have a look at this
bat<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> little<00:00:12.090> bit<00:00:12.179> different<00:00:12.570> shape<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
bat it's a little bit different shape to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.150 
bat it's a little bit different shape to
some<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.230> other<00:00:13.349> ones<00:00:13.530> some<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.950> them<00:00:14.040> are

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
some of the other ones some of them are

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.709 
some of the other ones some of them are
lower<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.700> actually<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> high<00:00:15.420> middle

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
lower this is actually a high middle

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.990 
lower this is actually a high middle
baton<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.260> very<00:00:16.529> very<00:00:16.800> full<00:00:17.070> now<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.820> good

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
baton it's very very full now the good

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.090 
baton it's very very full now the good
thing<00:00:18.060> about<00:00:18.270> higher<00:00:18.660> middle<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.230> they<00:00:20.039> do

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
thing about higher middle is they do

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.849 
thing about higher middle is they do
pick<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.699> quite<00:00:20.970> light<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:22.050> sort<00:00:22.740> of

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
pick up quite light so you can sort of

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.439 
pick up quite light so you can sort of
afford<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.340> go<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> little<00:00:23.789> bit<00:00:24.029> heavier<00:00:24.150> with

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
afford to go a little bit heavier with

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.880 
afford to go a little bit heavier with
these<00:00:24.630> due<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> way<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.350> they<00:00:25.500> pick<00:00:25.710> up

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
these due to the way that they pick up

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.259 
these due to the way that they pick up
and<00:00:26.099> that's<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.640> mixture<00:00:26.910> between<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and that's a mixture between the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.910 
and that's a mixture between the
profiling<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> great<00:00:28.439> timber<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
profiling and the great timber that

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.859 
profiling and the great timber that
they've<00:00:29.039> got<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.340> these<00:00:29.460> sticks<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:30.119> because

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
they've got in these sticks now because

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.089 
they've got in these sticks now because
it<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.109> higher<00:00:31.349> middle<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> be

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
it is a higher middle it's going to be

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
it is a higher middle it's going to be
suited<00:00:32.550> more<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.120> back<00:00:33.329> foot<00:00:33.570> players

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
suited more to your back foot players

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.889 
suited more to your back foot players
those<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> cut<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:36.420> pull

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
those that really like to cut and pull

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.990 
those that really like to cut and pull
at<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> ball<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.579> suit<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.850> very

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
at the ball it's going to suit you very

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
at the ball it's going to suit you very
well<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.770> full<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> have

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
well so it is very very full if you have

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.310 
well so it is very very full if you have
a<00:00:41.430> look<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.760> profiling<00:00:42.480> they're<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
a look at that profiling they're not a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
a look at that profiling they're not a
lot<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> scalping<00:00:44.070> whatsoever<00:00:44.640> that's<00:00:45.180> going

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
lot of scalping whatsoever that's going

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.190 
lot of scalping whatsoever that's going
to<00:00:45.510> offer<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.100> power<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.969> center<00:00:48.750> but

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to offer a lot of power off center but

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.660 
to offer a lot of power off center but
you're<00:00:49.320> still<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> heap<00:00:50.160> through

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you're still going to get a heap through

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.040 
you're still going to get a heap through
the<00:00:50.789> guts<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.600> there<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the guts as you can see there it's got a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.650 
the guts as you can see there it's got a
very<00:00:52.289> nice<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.829> large<00:00:53.579> spine<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.329> well<00:00:54.600> as

up or off center in the blade they're
not<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.860> char<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.340> vibrate<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
not going to char on vibrate as much in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.840 
not going to char on vibrate as much in
the<00:01:21.390> hand<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.810> I'll<00:01:22.320> give<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the hand so I'll give you a bit of a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
the hand so I'll give you a bit of a
test<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> mallet<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.619> see

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
test with a mallet now so you can see

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
test with a mallet now so you can see
where<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> sensor<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> already

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
where the sensor is and see it already

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.330 
where the sensor is and see it already
starts<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> hit<00:01:31.470> quite<00:01:31.740> well<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> top

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
starts to hit quite well at the top
