pears<00:01:58.510> were<00:01:58.720> probably<00:01:59.080> all<00:01:59.430> within<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.909> know

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
pears were probably all within you know

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.730 
pears were probably all within you know
one<00:02:01.240> or<00:02:01.330> two<00:02:01.360> hundred<00:02:01.720> yards<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.170> house<00:02:02.320> so

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
one or two hundred yards of the house so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.160 
one or two hundred yards of the house so
it's<00:02:03.580> going<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.790> be<00:02:03.880> as<00:02:04.000> local<00:02:04.510> as<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:05.020> can

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
it's going to be as local as we can

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.309 
it's going to be as local as we can
possibly<00:02:05.290> do<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.720> here's<00:02:07.720> our<00:02:07.840> airlock

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
possibly do it so here's our airlock

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.009 
possibly do it so here's our airlock
once<00:02:08.590> we<00:02:08.739> actually<00:02:08.890> put<00:02:09.189> the<00:02:09.220> must<00:02:09.519> in<00:02:09.729> there

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
once we actually put the must in there

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.820 
once we actually put the must in there
we're<00:02:11.019> using<00:02:11.230> Lovan<00:02:11.950> d40<00:02:12.580> seven<00:02:13.560> will<00:02:14.560> use<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
we're using Lovan d40 seven will use a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.510 
we're using Lovan d40 seven will use a
little<00:02:15.160> neat<00:02:15.400> yeast<00:02:16.000> nutrient

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
little neat yeast nutrient

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.830 
little neat yeast nutrient
and<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:19.660> little<00:02:19.870> pectin<00:02:20.410> enzyme<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:22.030> we're

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and a little pectin enzyme and we're

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.340 
and a little pectin enzyme and we're
sanitizing<00:02:23.440> everything<00:02:23.770> with<00:02:23.890> star<00:02:24.190> sand<00:02:24.490> and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
sanitizing everything with star sand and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.560 
sanitizing everything with star sand and
then<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.770> measured<00:02:27.100> out<00:02:27.250> our<00:02:27.400> honey<00:02:27.610> just<00:02:28.390> with

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
then we measured out our honey just with

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.130 
then we measured out our honey just with
a<00:02:28.600> normal<00:02:29.260> little<00:02:29.350> scale<00:02:29.770> there<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.840> hold<00:02:31.840> up<00:02:31.990> a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
a normal little scale there so hold up a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.450 
a normal little scale there so hold up a
minute<00:02:32.260> we'll<00:02:32.500> show<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.650> some<00:02:32.740> pictures<00:02:32.980> and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
minute we'll show you some pictures and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.400 
minute we'll show you some pictures and
I'll<00:02:34.210> show<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.510> actually<00:02:35.170> when<00:02:35.260> we're

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
I'll show you actually when we're

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:44.410 
I'll show you actually when we're
putting<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.770> in<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.010> bucket

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.010

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
we'll just straight we've already let it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.860 
we'll just straight we've already let it
cool<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:59.220> added<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> little<00:02:59.820> bit<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.120> distilled

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
cool and added a little bit of distilled

we're<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.860> little<00:03:26.340> bit<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.520> water<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.650> bring<00:03:28.650> it

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
we're a little bit of water to bring it

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.950 
we're a little bit of water to bring it
up<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> level<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.520> we<00:03:29.700> want<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.690> want<00:03:30.870> to

get this around five gallons try not to
splash<00:03:39.240> where<00:03:39.570> this<00:03:39.660> water<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.050> actually

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
splash where this water is actually

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.710 
splash where this water is actually
going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.560> help<00:03:41.120> cool<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.150> must<00:03:42.480> down<00:03:42.690> a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
going to help cool the must down a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.450 
going to help cool the must down a
little<00:03:42.990> bit<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.410> can<00:03:43.530> put<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.800> yeast<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
little bit so we can put the yeast in to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.920 
little bit so we can put the yeast in to
where<00:03:44.550> it's<00:03:44.700> not<00:03:44.790> too<00:03:45.000> hot<00:03:50.540> now<00:03:51.540> we've<00:03:51.690> got<00:03:51.900> a

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
where it's not too hot now we've got a

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.900 
where it's not too hot now we've got a
tablespoon<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:53.900> pectin<00:03:54.900> enzyme<00:03:55.740> we'll<00:03:56.730> add

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
tablespoon of pectin enzyme we'll add

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:08.570 
tablespoon of pectin enzyme we'll add
that<00:03:57.060> in<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:03.620> 1/4<00:04:04.620> teaspoon<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.890> yeasts

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
that in and 1/4 teaspoon of the yeasts

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.520 
that in and 1/4 teaspoon of the yeasts
nutrient<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.330> if<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.720> can<00:04:09.840> see<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.230> quarter

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
nutrient and if you can see that quarter

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.840 
nutrient and if you can see that quarter
teaspoon<00:04:13.130> just<00:04:14.130> about<00:04:14.340> ready<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.670> add<00:04:14.820> our

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
teaspoon just about ready to add our

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.710 
teaspoon just about ready to add our
yeast<00:04:15.380> and<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:17.250> last<00:04:17.460> bit<00:04:17.760> we're<00:04:18.510> going<00:04:18.630> to

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
yeast and the last bit we're going to

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.060 
yeast and the last bit we're going to
put<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:18.989> our<00:04:19.640> yeast<00:04:20.640> we<00:04:21.390> started<00:04:21.959> about<00:04:22.109> 20<00:04:22.530> 15

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
put in our yeast we started about 20 15

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.290 
put in our yeast we started about 20 15
20<00:04:23.340> minutes<00:04:23.580> ago<00:04:24.140> just<00:04:25.140> got<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:26.000> some<00:04:27.000> water

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
20 minutes ago just got it in some water

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.600 
20 minutes ago just got it in some water
that<00:04:27.540> was<00:04:27.660> about<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.080> hundred<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.770> 405<00:04:29.460> degrees

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
that was about a hundred and 405 degrees

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.390 
that was about a hundred and 405 degrees
and<00:04:30.120> stirred<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.170> around<00:04:31.260> real<00:04:31.560> slow<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.280> we'll

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
and stirred it around real slow so we'll

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.670 
and stirred it around real slow so we'll
add<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.730> in<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:36.300> after<00:04:37.080> we<00:04:37.200> have<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.500> in

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
add it in and after we have this in

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.160 
add it in and after we have this in
we're<00:04:37.920> going<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.070> start<00:04:38.370> real<00:04:39.000> good<00:04:39.210> get<00:04:40.080> it

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
we're going to start real good get it

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.720 
we're going to start real good get it
mixed<00:04:40.380> up<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.250> then<00:04:41.340> we're<00:04:41.430> going<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.580> add<00:04:41.700> our

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
mixed up and then we're going to add our

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.400 
mixed up and then we're going to add our
airlock<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.630> our<00:04:43.350> topper<00:04:44.840> all<00:04:45.840> right<00:04:46.050> well

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
airlock and our topper all right well

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.320 
airlock and our topper all right well
here's<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.800> last<00:04:47.130> step<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.850> first<00:04:48.090> phase

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
here's the last step of the first phase

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.870 
here's the last step of the first phase
it's<00:04:48.720> been<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.930> couple<00:04:49.110> days<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.710> as<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.730> can

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
it's been a couple days and as you can

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.870 
it's been a couple days and as you can
see<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.240> airlock<00:04:51.600> is<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.520> finally<00:04:53.520> bubbling

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
see the airlock is a finally bubbling

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.440 
see the airlock is a finally bubbling
away<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.720> initially<00:04:55.380> wasn't<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:56.010> I<00:04:56.300> added<00:04:57.300> some

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
away it initially wasn't so I added some

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.320 
away it initially wasn't so I added some
tape<00:04:57.810> around<00:04:58.020> here<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.290> think<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.620> was<00:04:58.710> actually

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
tape around here I think it was actually

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.580 
tape around here I think it was actually
the<00:05:00.330> excess<00:05:00.630> gas<00:05:00.810> was<00:05:01.080> coming<00:05:01.320> out<00:05:01.380> through

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
the excess gas was coming out through

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.200 
the excess gas was coming out through
the<00:05:01.650> lid<00:05:01.800> which<00:05:02.010> is<00:05:02.160> not<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.340> huge<00:05:02.669> problem<00:05:02.970> I

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
the lid which is not a huge problem I

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.260 
the lid which is not a huge problem I
just

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
just

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.240 
just
I<00:05:04.330> wanted<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.780> be<00:05:04.930> able<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.290> actually<00:05:05.650> see<00:05:06.100> the

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
I wanted to be able to actually see the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.690 
I wanted to be able to actually see the
airlock<00:05:06.550> working<00:05:07.890> after<00:05:08.890> this<00:05:09.040> we're<00:05:09.280> we're

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
airlock working after this we're we're

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.100 
airlock working after this we're we're
gonna<00:05:09.820> probably<00:05:10.360> wait<00:05:10.450> about<00:05:10.570> thirty<00:05:10.900> days

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
gonna probably wait about thirty days

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.160 
gonna probably wait about thirty days
and<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:13.090> we'll<00:05:13.240> do<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.570> first<00:05:13.690> racking

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
and and the we'll do the first racking

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.350 
and and the we'll do the first racking
and<00:05:14.320> then<00:05:14.470> we<00:05:15.370> might<00:05:15.550> rack<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:15.970> one<00:05:16.120> other<00:05:16.240> time

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
and then we might rack it one other time

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.350 
and then we might rack it one other time
after<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.580> but<00:05:18.580> we'll<00:05:18.730> show<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.030> later

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
after that but we'll show you that later

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.750 
after that but we'll show you that later
and<00:05:19.660> then<00:05:19.810> maybe<00:05:20.530> three<00:05:21.280> or<00:05:21.310> four<00:05:21.400> months

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
and then maybe three or four months

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.940 
and then maybe three or four months
we'll<00:05:21.850> be<00:05:21.880> bottling<00:05:22.390> this<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:23.080> alright<00:05:23.650> stay

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950
