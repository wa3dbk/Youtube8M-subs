00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.420
 that the manufacturer is really 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.189
 wanted to produce on the new owner 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.199
 hours impressed and took care of him 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.840
 the appearance of the activity is one of the main 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.700
 trumps this device if you do not know 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.130
 what's inside is smart stuffing 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.920
 you can never tell this model from 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120
 classic wrist watches 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 no extra parts 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.329
 look great on both male and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.170
 clock face and classic steel 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.899

 allow you to carry activity with almost 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.800
 any clothing key feature 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 distinguishing activity 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.680
 from most smartwatches it is of course 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.140
 physical arrows them here are three o'clock 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.900
 and the minute hand has a steel color and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.930
 show the time of the second transaction is not 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.220
 but there is a little blue arrow 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.990
 which is on the extra 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.610
 the dial at the bottom right 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 main dial 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.220
 this arrow shows the percentage and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.740
 achieve the goal of activity sum 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.409
 time arrows are not required 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.990
 during synchronization with the smartphone an hour 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.360
 and receives the time and automatically 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.850
 sets the minute hour hand to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 the position you need is just enough 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.820
 perform initial setup after 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.600
 buying watches 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 putting the arrows on the value 12 note 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.729
 Convex sapphire crystal closures 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.130
 dial it creates very beautiful 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.799
 glare and makes the watch look still 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.720
 perhaps more attractive 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.030
 the only parameter that can 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.520
 remind us of unusual start hours 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.229
 this case thickness however 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.810
 it is noticeable only with detailed 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.990
 reviewing watch band device 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.030
 made of genuine calf leather 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.629
 medium soft double stitched 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.150
 18 mm strap width is less 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.250
 standard value of 22 millimeter 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.890
 so the straps are about other watches for 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.180
 this model will not fit the attached 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 silicone strap included 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.860
 allows if necessary 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.450
 diversify the style beyond that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.239
 recommended to wear during classes 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.189

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.209
 versatility and water resistance 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.280
 moisture protection standard is the highest 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.680
 dive depth is supported 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.870
 50 meters 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.690
 despite the classic look of activity 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.549
 still unusual hours and to work with 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.739
 them even so they just 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.450
 showing the time correctly required 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.049

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.220
 Things like made after setting we 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.220
 see the main screen 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.739

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.870
 devices you tanks and ip clock house 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.849
 after each synchronization with 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.079
 applications transmit to him information about 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.790

 so you don't need to press anywhere 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.569
 or run some kind of application 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.669
 swim and then synchronize the clock with 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.799
 smartphone and see for a long time from 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.290
 swimming and calories dropped 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.260
 The number automatically determines not only 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.349
 swimming time but sleep time as well 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.879
 other fitness device activity 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.739
 captures the sleep phase and then gives out 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.409
 information about the total duration 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.019
 phases and number of awakenings creates 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.319
 visual diagram besides you can 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.209

 there is an opportunity to wake the user 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.489
 at a certain time interval picking up 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.290
 optimal sleep phase there is no alarm clock 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.750
 fixed only on fixed 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.150
 time specified 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.400
 vibrates waking you up 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.709
 the clock runs on standard batteries 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.889
 cr 2025 tablets 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.600
 which should last 8 months in 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.579
 the whole device produces very 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.680
 pleasant impression and let no 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.479
 there is no unique functionality here 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.280
 have seen many devices that can 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.889
 count steps and fix sleep phases 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.900

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.900
 swimming 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.330
 like fitness activity but in the case of 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.600
 activity is far more important than functionality 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.580
 as such and how it is done 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.380
 deterrent interfering right
