00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello here haiti jailbreak is 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.250
 today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.719
 unpacking the iphone 5 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.780
 so I got it this morning the iphone 5 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.750
 it just came out today and I 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.500
 have received so I'm going to unpack it with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.519
 you and it's a special video 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:31.250
 so we will start then we will 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.250
 take a pen 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:58.300
 so wait here then already so we 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.070
 can see right away that apple has made 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.650
 an effort on the representations we 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.430
 can see the iphone 5 on the box 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:11.380
 so the front of the box 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.649
 on both sides he wrote iphone 5 and 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.240
 on this one there is apple apple 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.240
 then we will open it right away 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.110
 here is the famous iphone 5 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.820
 so he is really light he loses 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.970
 end so we can see he is very very 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.720
 hungry so I pray them in white and 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.250
 silver 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.930
 so we can see both colors 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.830
 laurel silver here there is for m la 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.510
 pala the nano sim 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.689
 so it's still a smaller cape 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.950
 than the micro sim that is in the iphone 4 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:01.900
 and iphone 4s so there are movies on 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.009
 can see here the dock connector and the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.700
 audio jack so the headphone jack 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.890
 and the lock button 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.340
 if we now attack the map of 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.810
 the box 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.680
 so we will lift its up design by 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.390
 apple a Californian so here there is the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.860
 instructions for use inside so if we 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.750
 do not open quickly there is the small 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.360
 pin we will say that like that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:39.720
 to open the slot so we do that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.040
 and the heavy ones pushed to us then 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.110
 so when I spoke to you there is the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.960
 manual so you choose your linen 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.740
 hello the little logos that apple times 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.700
 nice with the delivery of the iphone so 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.130
 there he explains the operation 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.870
 short otherwise there is sahin so what has 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:04.100
 new headphones irp ode let's be 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.350
 present in a plastic box 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.590
 the little apple logo 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.100
 we're going to open them so apple said 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.740
 during his keynote in san francisco that 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.959
 he was a lot more he was a lot 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.450
 better 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.440
 so I do not know how to open that 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.420
 simply so already it is possible 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.720
 see it's a very very beautiful design that 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:40.890
 apple still made the cable and is no longer 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:45.510
 long apparently a dish so that's it 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.920
 can see the woman's headphones it's 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.340
 very special but it's really pretty 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.910
 if we compare with headphones with 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:06.330
 iphone 4 headphones per year 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:08.070
 so who are they like these so 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.880
 between here we can see the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.970
 difference between these two these two 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.160
 models so it's really different 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.350
 but they look really better 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.890
 it fits better to small ears 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:32.010
 for example then we can see the 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:34.830
 connector for the sockets and usb and the 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.680
 dock connector so that's gone into 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.669
 eight branches instead of 30 that was 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.950
 for the iphone 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.800
 so that's the 30 pin that was 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.520
 for iphone 4 and iphone 4s while 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.050
 while now it's an 8-pin 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.000
 so we can see we can see very well 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.380
 the difference 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.840
 this one can put it of both 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.310
 sides so we'll see everything now from 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.420
 after 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:10.290
 here there is a connector we can put it 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:11.580
 like this or else like this so there 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.550
 dog to light it and we can see the 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:22.070
 little apple then so if not so like 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:30.240
 like the previous ones here 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:33.030
 like that here and you plug in decision 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.220
 of power and it is repeated to the iphone 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.420
 5 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:45.480
 so here's the iphone 5 is on then 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:47.220
 I'm going back a little bit so we 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.620
 can immediately see the magnificent 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:57.600
 design so the screen is bigger there 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:00.630
 time is 4 inches ok so we will 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.850
 put in French so we see 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.360
 largely the screen it is really more 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.380
 big it is much lighter and that 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.000
 It's a certainty 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:16.610
 it smells so I live in France I'm going 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.610
 put the network so wait 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:35.580
 here I wait so connected next 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.900
 so we will wait for activation 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.550
 yeah so I will not be able to 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.200
 activate it because I did not put the 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.020
 sim card in 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.480
 so I'm going to make a video 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:50.110
 when the sim card will be in but 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.310
 already it was mostly the little video of 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.490
 presentation to show you the 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.690
 beautiful design of this new iphone 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:02.080
 so I'm going to put pictures on 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:05.080
 facebook of course and so here it is 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:09.160
 is really joly 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:13.080
 so it was haiti jailbreak for this 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.790
 unpacking video of the iphone 5 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.170
 the iphone 5 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:20.560
 I will put you videos of course 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:23.740
 on facebook and we find ourselves for 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.300
 next videos that I would do well 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:31.090
 sure in very very soon 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.820
