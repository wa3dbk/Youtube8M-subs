gp-30 I picked this up at a hobby shop
for<00:00:11.750> $39<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.370> that's<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.580> good<00:00:15.389> price<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.400> I'll

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
for $39 so that's a good price and I'll

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.859 
for $39 so that's a good price and I'll
start<00:00:17.730> here<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.090> front<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.480> some<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
start here in the front with some of the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.870 
start here in the front with some of the
detailing<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.550> UPC<00:00:21.029> old<00:00:22.670> headlights<00:00:23.670> up

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
detailing the UPC old headlights up

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.009 
detailing the UPC old headlights up
there<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:25.350> light<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.859> kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.730> set<00:00:27.269> back<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
there the light is kind of set back a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.500 
there the light is kind of set back a
little<00:00:28.289> bit<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.609> kind<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> more<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
little bit so it's kind of more of a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.030 
little bit so it's kind of more of a
cabin<00:00:30.990> light<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.270> it<00:00:33.270> also<00:00:33.480> lights<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
cabin light and it also lights up in the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.310 
cabin light and it also lights up in the
front<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.969> back<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.110> either

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
front and in the back going in either

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.139 
front and in the back going in either
direction<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.700> doesn't<00:00:38.910> have

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
direction so it's it doesn't have

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.810 
direction so it's it doesn't have
directional<00:00:39.719> lighting<00:00:39.960> maybe<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.160> get

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
directional lighting maybe I can get

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.770 
directional lighting maybe I can get
that<00:00:42.030> worked<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
that worked out and here we have a

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.250 
that worked out and here we have a
three-time<00:00:45.780> air<00:00:45.930> horn<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.420> here<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
three-time air horn and here we have the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
three-time air horn and here we have the
yupi<00:00:49.530> shows<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> side<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.480> should

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
yupi shows on the side but what should

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.400 
yupi shows on the side but what should
be<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:54.539> road<00:00:54.809> number<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.379> there

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
be there is the road number right there

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
be there is the road number right there
and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.610> shield<00:00:56.910> should<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.270> placed<00:00:57.719> about

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and the shield should be placed about

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.319 
and the shield should be placed about
right<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.190> maybe<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> decal

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
right there so maybe I can get a decal

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.579 
right there so maybe I can get a decal
to<00:01:00.600> fix<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.420> but<00:01:03.420> that's<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.780> my<00:01:04.199> biggest

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to fix that but that's not my biggest

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.510 
to fix that but that's not my biggest
concern<00:01:05.900> same<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.350> somewhat<00:01:08.010> floppy

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
concern same with the somewhat floppy

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.990 
concern same with the somewhat floppy
handrails<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:10.280> does<00:01:11.280> stuff<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> live

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
