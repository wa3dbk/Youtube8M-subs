is<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> network<00:00:15.240> aware<00:00:15.629> but<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:15.929> also<00:00:16.110> smart

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
is a network aware but it's also smart

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.980 
is a network aware but it's also smart
enough<00:00:17.280> to<00:00:17.340> be<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> standalone<00:00:18.030> PA<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:18.779> box

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
enough to be a standalone PA in one box

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.589 
enough to be a standalone PA in one box
because<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.650> has<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> whole<00:00:20.189> bunch<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.820> extra

features you do not expect to see in a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.620 
features you do not expect to see in a
speaker<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.210> we're<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> do

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
speaker like this so we're going to do

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.970 
speaker like this so we're going to do
is<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.929> turn<00:00:25.050> around<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.320> side<00:00:25.560> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
is going to turn around to the side so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.259 
is going to turn around to the side so
we<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.160> give<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.429> chance<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.939> look<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we can give you a chance to look at the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.570 
we can give you a chance to look at the
side<00:00:27.539> panel<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.980> speaker<00:00:29.310> has<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
side panel so the speaker has a

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.089 
side panel so the speaker has a
full-featured<00:00:30.599> two<00:00:30.900> channel<00:00:31.320> digital<00:00:31.589> mixing

enclosure so from the bottom you have

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.580 
enclosure so from the bottom you have
the<00:00:36.300> line<00:00:36.570> inputs<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.990> the<00:00:37.050> pad<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the line inputs in the pad you have a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.890 
the line inputs in the pad you have a
mic<00:00:37.770> pre<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.670> 3<00:00:38.970> band<00:00:39.180> EQ<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.750> each

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
mic pre you have 3 band EQ for each

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.560 
mic pre you have 3 band EQ for each
channel<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.740> sweepable<00:00:41.100> mid<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.300> actually

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
channel with sweepable mid you actually

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.970 
channel with sweepable mid you actually
have<00:00:42.660> digital<00:00:42.960> effects<00:00:43.290> built<00:00:43.620> right<00:00:43.800> into

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
have digital effects built right into

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.980 
have digital effects built right into
the<00:00:44.130> speaker<00:00:44.310> so<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.790> have<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.390> modulation

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
the speaker so you have a modulation

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.300 
the speaker so you have a modulation
effect<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.560> much<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> vocal

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
effect which is much like a vocal

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.690 
effect which is much like a vocal
doubler<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> also<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> digital<00:00:48.960> reverb<00:00:49.700> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
doubler and also a digital reverb so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
doubler and also a digital reverb so
this<00:00:51.180> also<00:00:51.450> has<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:52.080> built-in<00:00:52.710> feedback

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this also has a built-in feedback

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.890 
this also has a built-in feedback
suppression<00:00:53.850> circuit<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.720> neat

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
suppression circuit which is really neat

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.870 
suppression circuit which is really neat
for<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.290> speaker<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.740> this<00:00:55.950> it's<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> 12

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
for a speaker like this it's a 12

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.200 
for a speaker like this it's a 12
frequency<00:00:58.220> suppressor<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.610> it'll<00:00:59.790> scan<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
frequency suppressor so it'll scan the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
frequency suppressor so it'll scan the
entire<00:01:00.480> audio<00:01:00.990> range<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.620> remove<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.130> 12

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
entire audio range and remove up to 12

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.410 
entire audio range and remove up to 12
frequencies<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.120> giving<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
frequencies that are giving you a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
frequencies that are giving you a
problem<00:01:03.690> automatically<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.650> nothing<00:01:04.979> for

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
problem automatically with nothing for

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
problem automatically with nothing for
you<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> configure<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> life<00:01:06.509> saver

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you to configure so it's a life saver

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.649 
you to configure so it's a life saver
live<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.979> after<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.969> very

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
live and then after that you have very

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.419 
live and then after that you have very
ex<00:01:09.810> acoustic<00:01:10.259> modeling<00:01:10.619> built<00:01:10.829> right<00:01:11.009> in<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
ex acoustic modeling built right in so

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.169

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.149 
only Line six could come up with of
course<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.499> let's<00:01:40.649> move<00:01:40.770> through<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> back

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
course so let's move through the back

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.620 
course so let's move through the back
panel<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.789> we'll<00:01:41.969> show<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.210> what's<00:01:42.359> going<00:01:42.509> on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
panel and we'll show you what's going on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
panel and we'll show you what's going on
there<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.439> we're<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> back<00:01:43.799> panel<00:01:44.189> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
there so now we're on the back panel so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.039 
there so now we're on the back panel so
you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.179> line<00:01:45.509> inputs<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:45.960> on

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
you can see you have line inputs here on

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.260 
you can see you have line inputs here on
the<00:01:46.109> top<00:01:46.289> you<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.920> combi<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.549> put<00:01:47.729> line<00:01:47.969> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the top you got a combi in put line and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
the top you got a combi in put line and
also<00:01:48.749> a<00:01:48.990> stereo<00:01:49.920> line<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.149> has<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
also a stereo line because it has the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.749 
also a stereo line because it has the
ability<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:52.229> input<00:01:53.219> from<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.429> CD<00:01:53.670> player

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
ability to take input from a CD player

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.010 
ability to take input from a CD player
or<00:01:53.999> a<00:01:55.310> karaoke<00:01:56.310> machine<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> DVD<00:01:57.509> player<00:01:57.539> or

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
or a karaoke machine or a DVD player or

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.569 
or a karaoke machine or a DVD player or
something<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.499> so<00:01:59.039> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.249> play<00:01:59.429> over

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
something like that so you can play over

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.279 
something like that so you can play over
tracks<00:01:59.939> live<00:02:00.209> you<00:02:00.569> can<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.959> for<00:02:01.079> break

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
tracks live you can use it for break

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.109 
tracks live you can use it for break
music<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.039> that<00:02:02.159> gives<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> four<00:02:02.639> inputs<00:02:02.969> not

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
music so that gives you four inputs not

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.389 
music so that gives you four inputs not
just<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.889> line<00:02:05.039> outputs

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
just two if you have the line outputs

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.609 
just two if you have the line outputs
and<00:02:05.520> mix<00:02:05.670> outputs<00:02:06.030> their<00:02:06.270> master<00:02:06.990> knob<00:02:07.139> and<00:02:07.409> in

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
and mix outputs their master knob and in

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.100 
and mix outputs their master knob and in
here<00:02:08.100> it's<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> very<00:02:08.789> important<00:02:09.420> part<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
here it's a very important part of the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
here it's a very important part of the
speaker<00:02:10.410> design<00:02:10.530> because<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.340> speaker<00:02:11.640> has

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
speaker design because the speaker has

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.340 
speaker design because the speaker has
the<00:02:11.910> ability<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.240> retune<00:02:12.630> itself<00:02:12.990> depending

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the ability to retune itself depending

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.350 
the ability to retune itself depending
on<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.740> need<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.370> time<00:02:14.610> so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
on what you need it to do at the time so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.400 
on what you need it to do at the time so
it<00:02:15.390> has<00:02:15.480> six<00:02:16.080> different

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
it has six different

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.230 
it has six different
operational<00:02:16.920> modes<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.460> depending<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.150> what

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
operational modes and depending on what

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.150 
operational modes and depending on what
you<00:02:18.360> needed<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.690> do<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.350> swap<00:02:19.740> in<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.070> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
you needed to do you can swap in one of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.830 
you needed to do you can swap in one of
those<00:02:20.250> modes<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:21.030> change<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> sound<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
those modes to change the sound of the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870 
those modes to change the sound of the
speaker<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.440> fully<00:02:22.740> DSP<00:02:23.160> operated<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.760> so

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
speaker it's fully DSP operated and so

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.640 
speaker it's fully DSP operated and so
we<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.180> complete<00:02:24.570> control<00:02:24.870> over<00:02:24.990> frequency

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
we have complete control over frequency

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.430 
we have complete control over frequency
response<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> time<00:02:27.030> alignment<00:02:27.600> for<00:02:28.020> all<00:02:28.230> of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
response and time alignment for all of

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.710 
response and time alignment for all of
the<00:02:28.530> components<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.670> reference<00:02:30.330> PA<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the components so reference PA is the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.040 
the components so reference PA is the
default<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.680> flat<00:02:32.540> sounding<00:02:33.540> very<00:02:33.720> punchy

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
default it's a flat sounding very punchy

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.600 
default it's a flat sounding very punchy
sounding<00:02:34.500> mode<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> crossover<00:02:35.490> point

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
sounding mode with a crossover point

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.180 
sounding mode with a crossover point
about<00:02:35.940> 2.2<00:02:36.390> K<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.690> think<00:02:37.080> below<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.160> have

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
about 2.2 K I think below that you have

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.610 
about 2.2 K I think below that you have
playback<00:02:38.700> mode<00:02:38.970> which<00:02:39.600> designed<00:02:40.170> for

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
playback mode which designed for

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.460 
playback mode which designed for
commercially<00:02:41.370> recorded<00:02:42.000> CD<00:02:42.870> kind<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.320> stuff

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
commercially recorded CD kind of stuff

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.900 
commercially recorded CD kind of stuff
so<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.680> you're<00:02:43.800> doing<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.010> DJ<00:02:44.340> gig<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.790> you're

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
so if you're doing a DJ gig and you're

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.090 
so if you're doing a DJ gig and you're
only<00:02:45.030> using<00:02:45.150> mastered<00:02:45.720> tracks<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:46.800> flip

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
only using mastered tracks you can flip

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.740 
only using mastered tracks you can flip
into<00:02:47.250> playback<00:02:47.610> mode<00:02:47.820> it's<00:02:48.060> very<00:02:48.270> similar<00:02:48.570> to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
into playback mode it's very similar to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.780 
into playback mode it's very similar to
reference<00:02:49.410> PA<00:02:49.560> mode<00:02:49.800> except<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.640> has

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
reference PA mode except for that it has

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.310 
reference PA mode except for that it has
more<00:02:51.180> Lo<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.450> extension<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.050> more<00:02:52.140> high-end

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
more Lo and extension and more high-end

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.920 
more Lo and extension and more high-end
extensions<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.100> sort<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.700> some<00:02:53.930> uber

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
extensions for sort of some uber

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.600 
extensions for sort of some uber
sexiness<00:02:55.470> for<00:02:55.710> those<00:02:55.830> dance<00:02:56.070> party<00:02:56.400> kind<00:02:56.520> of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
sexiness for those dance party kind of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.700 
sexiness for those dance party kind of
things<00:02:56.820> beneath<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.350> floor

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
things beneath that you have floor

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.460 
things beneath that you have floor
monitor<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.120> has<00:03:00.450> an<00:03:00.630> accelerometer<00:03:01.020> built

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
monitor so it has an accelerometer built

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.420 
monitor so it has an accelerometer built
right<00:03:01.650> into<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.950> speaker

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
right into the speaker

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.140 
right into the speaker
so<00:03:02.940> at<00:03:03.090> powerup<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:04.050> it's<00:03:04.290> lying<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.650> its<00:03:04.800> side

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
so at powerup if it's lying on its side

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.460 
so at powerup if it's lying on its side
the<00:03:06.150> speaker<00:03:06.420> will<00:03:06.570> automatically<00:03:07.230> turn

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the speaker will automatically turn

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.020 
the speaker will automatically turn
itself<00:03:07.500> into<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.010> floor<00:03:08.310> monitor<00:03:08.610> which<00:03:08.820> means

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
itself into a floor monitor which means

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.690 
itself into a floor monitor which means
that<00:03:09.300> it'll<00:03:09.690> sort<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.410> shape<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:10.980> low<00:03:11.250> end<00:03:11.460> to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
that it'll sort of shape the low end to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.860 
that it'll sort of shape the low end to
make<00:03:11.850> sure<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.270> doesn't<00:03:12.420> couple<00:03:12.780> with

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
make sure that it doesn't couple with

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.270 
make sure that it doesn't couple with
the<00:03:12.960> stage<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.440> create<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.710> bunch<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.980> bass

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the stage and create a bunch of bass

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.550 
the stage and create a bunch of bass
low-end<00:03:15.090> stuff<00:03:15.240> running<00:03:15.780> across<00:03:15.960> stage<00:03:16.320> as<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
low-end stuff running across stage as a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.290 
low-end stuff running across stage as a
four<00:03:16.800> wedge<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.460> it'll<00:03:17.640> automatically<00:03:18.120> do

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
four wedge so it'll automatically do

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300 
four wedge so it'll automatically do
that<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.050> always<00:03:19.230> flip<00:03:20.010> through<00:03:20.220> this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
that you can always flip through this

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.920 
that you can always flip through this
and<00:03:20.580> change<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.180> mode<00:03:21.390> if<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.570> don't<00:03:21.780> like

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and change that mode if you don't like

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.110 
and change that mode if you don't like
that<00:03:22.110> automatic<00:03:22.560> behavior<00:03:22.920> beneath<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.000> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
that automatic behavior beneath that you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.940 
that automatic behavior beneath that you
have<00:03:24.240> keyboard<00:03:24.630> mode<00:03:24.840> where<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.500> raises<00:03:25.830> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
have keyboard mode where it raises the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.230 
have keyboard mode where it raises the
crossover<00:03:26.340> frequency<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.760> like<00:03:26.910> three<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
crossover frequency to like three and a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.510 
crossover frequency to like three and a
half<00:03:27.330> K<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.930> runs<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.830> kind<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.130> flat<00:03:29.340> it's

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
half K and runs it kind of flat it's

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.040 
half K and runs it kind of flat it's
it's<00:03:29.730> designed<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.240> sort<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.570> sound<00:03:30.840> really

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
it's designed to sort of sound really

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.570 
it's designed to sort of sound really
nice<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:31.560> instruments<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.160> kind<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.340> stuff

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
nice for instruments that kind of stuff

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.400 
nice for instruments that kind of stuff
beneath<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.570> have<00:03:33.720> acoustic<00:03:34.050> guitar

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
beneath that you have acoustic guitar

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.100 
beneath that you have acoustic guitar
mode<00:03:34.650> which<00:03:35.220> does<00:03:35.550> very<00:03:36.390> similar<00:03:36.690> things<00:03:36.959> to

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
mode which does very similar things to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.690 
mode which does very similar things to
keyboard<00:03:37.650> mode<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> crossover<00:03:38.520> point

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
keyboard mode so the crossover point

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.490 
keyboard mode so the crossover point
stays<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.000> same<00:03:39.030> except<00:03:39.959> for<00:03:40.080> that<00:03:40.140> acoustic

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
stays the same except for that acoustic

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.130 
stays the same except for that acoustic
guitar<00:03:40.770> basically<00:03:41.810> shape<00:03:42.810> some<00:03:42.990> of<00:03:43.080> that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
guitar basically shape some of that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.390 
guitar basically shape some of that
low-end<00:03:43.440> out<00:03:43.590> again<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.950> make<00:03:44.070> sure<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
low-end out again to make sure that the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.740 
low-end out again to make sure that the
acoustic<00:03:44.580> guitar<00:03:44.880> doesn't<00:03:45.120> get<00:03:45.209> boomy<00:03:45.540> and

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
acoustic guitar doesn't get boomy and

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.410 
acoustic guitar doesn't get boomy and
for<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:46.920> pot<00:03:47.190> owners<00:03:47.640> there's<00:03:48.030> an<00:03:48.150> electric

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
guitar mode which is kind of neat it

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.380 
guitar mode which is kind of neat it

cabinet rolling off frequencies the
right<00:04:02.370> way<00:04:02.520> so<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:03.180> still<00:04:03.390> sounds<00:04:03.600> like<00:04:03.660> a

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
right way so it still sounds like a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.270 
right way so it still sounds like a
guitar<00:04:03.900> amp<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.410> not<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.770> HiFi<00:04:05.220> stereo

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
guitar amp and not like a HiFi stereo

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.370 
guitar amp and not like a HiFi stereo
system<00:04:05.820> with<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.970> tweeter<00:04:06.180> which<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.230> nice

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
system with the tweeter which is nice

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.620 
system with the tweeter which is nice
and<00:04:07.950> beneath<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.239> jacks<00:04:09.480> for

connected together over the l6 link they

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.390 
connected together over the l6 link they
changed<00:04:28.200> their<00:04:28.350> behavior<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.950> better<00:04:29.130> suit

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
changed their behavior to better suit

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.839 
changed their behavior to better suit
with<00:04:29.580> a

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
with a

with a
been<00:04:29.999> connected<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.449> so<00:04:31.229> if<00:04:31.349> you<00:04:31.379> plug<00:04:31.619> in<00:04:31.800> to

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
been connected to so if you plug in to

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.679 
been connected to so if you plug in to
l3<00:04:32.399> T's<00:04:32.580> next<00:04:32.849> to<00:04:32.909> each<00:04:32.969> other<00:04:33.059> they<00:04:33.569> will

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:33.689 
l3 T's next to each other they will

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.359 
l3 T's next to each other they will
automatically<00:04:34.199> split<00:04:34.499> and<00:04:34.740> become<00:04:34.889> stereo

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:35.369 
automatically split and become stereo

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:38.329 
automatically split and become stereo
left<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:35.939> right<00:04:36.059> so<00:04:36.809> your<00:04:37.069> coaxial<00:04:38.069> inputs

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:38.339 
left and right so your coaxial inputs

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:40.309 
left and right so your coaxial inputs
are<00:04:38.459> now<00:04:38.550> stereo<00:04:38.819> your<00:04:39.419> digital<00:04:39.899> effects<00:04:40.169> are

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
are now stereo your digital effects are

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.989 
are now stereo your digital effects are
now<00:04:40.409> stereo<00:04:40.709> everything<00:04:41.429> and<00:04:41.580> now<00:04:41.729> you<00:04:41.789> have

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:41.999 
now stereo everything and now you have

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.570 
now stereo everything and now you have
an<00:04:42.089> eight<00:04:42.240> channel<00:04:42.539> system<00:04:42.839> not<00:04:43.259> just<00:04:43.469> for<00:04:43.709> so

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
an eight channel system not just for so

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.659 
an eight channel system not just for so
the<00:04:44.699> idea<00:04:44.969> behind<00:04:45.149> l6<00:04:45.869> link<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.259> that

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
the idea behind l6 link is that

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.619 
the idea behind l6 link is that
philosophically<00:04:47.669> when<00:04:48.209> you<00:04:48.300> connect

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
philosophically when you connect

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:50.149 
philosophically when you connect
multiple<00:04:48.809> devices<00:04:49.050> together<00:04:49.619> you<00:04:49.770> get<00:04:49.889> more

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
multiple devices together you get more

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.909 
multiple devices together you get more
you<00:04:50.969> don't<00:04:51.119> have<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.389> know<00:04:51.539> exactly<00:04:51.990> what's

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
you don't have to know exactly what's

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.889 
you don't have to know exactly what's
going<00:04:53.069> on<00:04:53.249> it<00:04:53.550> just<00:04:53.610> does<00:04:53.909> it<00:04:53.939> for<00:04:54.209> you<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.689> it's

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:54.899 
going on it just does it for you so it's

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.689 
going on it just does it for you so it's
kind<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.199> neat<00:04:55.319> situation<00:04:55.889> to<00:04:55.949> have<00:04:56.099> now<00:04:56.490> you

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
kind of a neat situation to have now you

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.169 
kind of a neat situation to have now you
have<00:04:56.999> kickstands<00:04:57.449> built<00:04:57.719> in<00:04:57.899> so<00:04:58.679> when<00:04:58.979> you're

00:04:59.169 --> 00:04:59.179 
have kickstands built in so when you're

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:01.399 
have kickstands built in so when you're
running<00:05:00.179> as<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:00.419> floor<00:05:00.659> wedge<00:05:00.809> you<00:05:00.990> have<00:05:01.020> three

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
running as a floor wedge you have three

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.230 
running as a floor wedge you have three
different<00:05:01.679> angles<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:02.039> can<00:05:02.129> run<00:05:02.309> 30<00:05:02.610> 60<00:05:03.209> and

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
different angles you can run 30 60 and

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.619 
different angles you can run 30 60 and
90<00:05:03.449> degree<00:05:04.050> because<00:05:04.649> the<00:05:04.769> handle<00:05:05.129> also<00:05:05.629> acts

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
90 degree because the handle also acts

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.669 
90 degree because the handle also acts
as<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.169> kickstand<00:05:07.679> as<00:05:07.800> well<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.449> have<00:05:09.679> a

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:10.679 
as a kickstand as well so you have a

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:13.070 
as a kickstand as well so you have a
subwoofer<00:05:11.399> in<00:05:11.669> the<00:05:11.789> family<00:05:12.179> as<00:05:12.330> well<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.629> l3s

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
subwoofer in the family as well on l3s

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.249 
subwoofer in the family as well on l3s
which<00:05:13.889> has<00:05:14.429> the<00:05:14.610> same<00:05:14.789> speaker<00:05:15.569> mode<00:05:15.749> sort<00:05:16.169> of

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
which has the same speaker mode sort of

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.290 
which has the same speaker mode sort of
capability<00:05:16.979> so<00:05:17.249> when<00:05:17.729> you<00:05:17.819> connect<00:05:18.149> these

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
capability so when you connect these

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.149 
capability so when you connect these
guys<00:05:18.509> together<00:05:18.839> over<00:05:19.379> l6<00:05:19.769> link<00:05:19.949> it

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
guys together over l6 link it

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:21.799 
guys together over l6 link it
