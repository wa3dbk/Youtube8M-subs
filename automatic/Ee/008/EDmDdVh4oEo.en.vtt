00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.930
 the lagrein the wine of which I will speak to you 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.930
 today it is born in the northernmost area 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.700
 italy the tall adige that coincides with 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.710
 the province of bolzano 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.170
 and it is right in the city ​​of bolzano that 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.109
 we find one of the theses chris vineyards 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.900
 an urban center can accommodate and 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.109
 grapes from this vineyard are the grape 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.109
 great 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:39.340
 [Music] 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:45.370
 this ruby red wine tending to 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:49.240
 garnet with a real rough tannin is 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.560
 decided but the nose is complex and 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.740
 elegant a bit just like his land 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:01.420
 made of valley mountains and rivers that 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:05.049
 the lagrein is flowing between these vineyards 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 a wine that has always fascinated and that 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:11.380
 it is found however in the tables 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.930
 housewives in the region of the upper Adige 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.030
 it is a wine that has recently had one 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.750
 spread outside its borders 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 regional 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.480
 its matrix is certainly a matrix 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.690
 Nordic different from the wines of the center and 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.110
 southern Italy but not for this 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.830
 it is not a hot wine but rather a wine that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.240
 it envelops you even in long evenings 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:44.229
 winter with a flaring fire i 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.600
 hints of black tobacco and cassis 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.940
 just cut fresh grass just like 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.010
 those of the English countryside make me 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.370
 think of combinations first of all 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.299
 with cheeses together with del 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:02.680
 chestnut honey for example or 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.350
 jams or roe deer in sauce 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.630
 of blueberry 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.600
 greedy all but if you really are 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.240
 of good cigar lovers 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.560
 I will recommend a combination the 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.560
 race in itself Tuscan cigar 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.669
