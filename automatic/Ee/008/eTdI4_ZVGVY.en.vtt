00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone you cheese from you again 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.649
 see the yellow square on the hand on the background 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.870
 square minecraft are like that 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:16.279
 Today we have such a tutorial 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:20.310
 review on 1 part tutorial on fashion 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.859
 ars magica 2 where I came after 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.500
 as I myself wanted to understand kimono 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.990
 worldly Park City and found the mod is not well 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 I found a Russian-speaking guide on this 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.860
 version of the mod here and so today he 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 growing apart we look at what's common 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.629
 add changes this mod in this world 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.920
 and the first thing to notice is 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.840
 witch tree but so called 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 general 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.030
 growing randomly handle in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.149
 world and with him fall so cool 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.930
 Leaves properties as usual wood then 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.299
 there is a coal stove there seems to be like that too 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.070
 look ordinary as usual and not even 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.350
 burn through 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.979
 but still it is made as the board's 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:20.790
 usually believed it we will consider later 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.150
 this is out in the first part not in the pilot yes 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.450
 we are here to tell the flowers do not know 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.630
 how for what they are not needed at all 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.329
 Kraft and on the site I did not find like this 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.360
 then you can see here are not 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.189
 sand here are such sandy new ones 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.159
 flowers used for crafting 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.200
 Crystal key is better and dust patty 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.439
 mono this is the most important application 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.509
 this flower on perhaps there still require 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.490
 stand orchids 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 turn out of course and I here now they 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.480
 these 7 orchids grow 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.490
 they can also be found 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.950
 by the way do not pay attention to 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.710
 Shelf they still do not do us 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.440
 it wo n't say like this 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.470
 Usually on games there will be games first 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:24.280
 such a blue orchid it is exactly the same 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:27.340
 graph here and so on as could be noticed 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.470
 these are puddles added here 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.130
 this is already clean as a source of clean 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.250
 sensei like this too 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.010
 will be in the first part but how could 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.850
 notice a flower makes such waves 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.320
 particles you can not 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:54.400
 interact with this water yourself 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.830
 as far as I know further, further it is possible 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.660
 notice here such Andrei from 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.640
 wait for more detachment them again in 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.980
 following series in one of the following 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.980
 episodes further i what you dug yank 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:17.170
 there is such a labor here 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.750
 amber ventari 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.180
 I won't know intel pentium 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.230
 translate and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:30.160
 and I am forwarded to please very 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.410
 an important element of dust is such a second 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.800
 do all sorts of things which again 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.310
 more in the next series who will be 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.310
 interesting 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.959
 so this is 5 for what they do not 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.450
 I know from them if there is no planet 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.870
 as the words are not this russian it is in russian 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.230
 language 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.230
 Okay, let's try to beat, I guess 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:12.430
 perhaps dishonest well here are the cases 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.220
 look further what else is the same mod 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.350
 adds a few recovery potions 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:24.700
 Mana which principle is needed by the magician 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:29.980
 pretty much private we them here 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:34.200
 they begin immediately end and 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.770
 epic mana potion and and here's the legendary 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.220
 as they are made not in all the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.830
 items probably won't tell us yes 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.380
 then in the next series we will again 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.660
 I will understand before 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.660
 filming and will be showing you that from 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.990
 this also turned out to be a mod 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.650
 adds such flowers here in their will 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:04.030
 what are they for and who doesn't know 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:08.020
 why not do such a trailer 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.360
 tiki will understand again so 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.550
 further he and now you can see everything 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.700
 ores that exist this adds 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.780
 like all their joy to sort of 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.380
 incidence 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.689
 at least as i met them feast 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:28.219
 us later 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:32.539
 90 red screwed but this is the most ore 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:34.969
 in short so they dug out that they 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.129
 You can say it is performed once again. 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:41.269
 the dust that I showed you next 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:44.209
 us goes what is called chemistry ride it 

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:50.199
 used for some stuff now 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:50.199
 I'll show you here 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.410
 here are such things can still be weave 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.960
 spine there are quite rare so under a 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.759
 even ksn itself can be used for 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.490
 spine may be quite rare 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.560
 what you produce you find at 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.400
 it 's over for the end 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.729
 power us goes as forgot crystals 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:20.990
 some kid crystals all let it down 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:24.699
 us further is done for craft you argue 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.410
 class drugs generally more true 1 well 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.150
 such very necessary craft and others 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.919
 blocks brackets which do nothing 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.669
 forgiving the most needed shorter crystal 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:40.539
 for once gave us goes red 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:42.039
 some kind of firestone sunny 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:45.139
 just a minute 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:47.060
 sun stone who used only 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:52.910
 for a block or something else 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:55.630
 used is considering it grows 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.630
 Moonstone 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:06.639
 its purpose for him like 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:09.530
 also not but again we will understand and 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.770
 Now a bit in this fashion as written 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.449
 on the main pages your look at 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.490
 fry may change if you add 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.470
 magic pick up spell fighting 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.820
 bosses fun with magic it is equipped 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.620

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.330
 where you can create any spell you 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.949

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.909
 who can imagine 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.909
 more interesting with friends on the server 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:30.020
 using magic this is literally a pilot 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:33.349
