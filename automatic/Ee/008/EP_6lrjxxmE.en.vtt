the bed is there's a couple different
reasons<00:01:50.390> pumps<00:01:51.170> are<00:01:51.259> designed<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.590> push<00:01:51.890> not

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
reasons pumps are designed to push not

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.620 
reasons pumps are designed to push not
pull<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:52.789> if<00:01:52.880> you've<00:01:53.000> got<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.149> up<00:01:53.330> there<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.539> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
pull so if you've got it up there in the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.420 
pull so if you've got it up there in the
front<00:01:53.750> it's<00:01:54.200> gotta<00:01:54.380> suck<00:01:54.619> all<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:54.890> fluid<00:01:55.220> up

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
front it's gotta suck all that fluid up

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.499 
front it's gotta suck all that fluid up
there<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.729> front<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.060> you're<00:01:56.180> gonna<00:01:56.270> burn

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
there to the front and you're gonna burn

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.270 
there to the front and you're gonna burn
through<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.750> lot<00:01:56.899> of<00:01:56.990> pumps<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.770> not<00:01:58.100> that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
through a lot of pumps so not that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.499 
through a lot of pumps so not that
there's<00:01:58.430> any<00:01:58.550> room<00:01:58.759> underneath<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.270> hood<00:01:59.390> of

there's any room underneath the hood of
this<00:01:59.600> thing<00:01:59.660> anyway<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:00.200> gravity<00:02:00.979> will<00:02:01.039> feed

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
this thing anyway so gravity will feed

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.350 
this thing anyway so gravity will feed
the<00:02:01.340> pump<00:02:01.550> it'll<00:02:01.789> push<00:02:01.910> it<00:02:02.060> up<00:02:02.149> there

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
the pump it'll push it up there

everything's<00:02:02.930> good<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.140> go<00:02:03.229> now<00:02:03.500> make<00:02:03.770> sure

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
everything's good to go now make sure

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.190 
everything's good to go now make sure
before<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.250> make<00:02:04.550> your<00:02:04.580> mix<00:02:05.390> your<00:02:05.539> mixture<00:02:05.959> go

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
before you make your mix your mixture go

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.990 
before you make your mix your mixture go
ahead<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.800> outside<00:02:07.009> put<00:02:07.700> your<00:02:07.819> water

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000

ahead and do it outside put your water
and<00:02:08.090> your<00:02:08.209> methanol<00:02:08.569> together<00:02:08.959> you'll<00:02:09.259> be<00:02:09.380> a

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
and your methanol together you'll be a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.660 
and your methanol together you'll be a
little<00:02:09.560> more<00:02:09.709> accurate<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.190> way<00:02:10.340> then<00:02:10.550> go

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
little more accurate that way then go

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.190 
little more accurate that way then go
ahead<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.970> dump<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.180> into<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.480> tank<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.110> know

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I would try to say that ten times and it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.440 
I would try to say that ten times and it
might<00:02:13.730> get<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.940> little<00:02:14.060> bit<00:02:14.240> it's<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.420> little
