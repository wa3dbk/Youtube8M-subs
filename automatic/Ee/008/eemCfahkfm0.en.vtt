Merrell and today we're going to be
rounding<00:00:03.570> out<00:00:03.629> our<00:00:03.689> knowledge<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.350> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
rounding out our knowledge of the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.380 
rounding out our knowledge of the
pistols<00:00:04.920> featured<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.370> black<00:00:05.580> ops<00:00:05.790> 2<00:00:05.910> and

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
pistols featured in black ops 2 and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:21.070 
pistols featured in black ops 2 and
getting<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.779> much<00:00:06.990> closer<00:00:07.259> look<00:00:07.410> at<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.799> kap-40

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.630 

now<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.230> weapon<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> little<00:00:23.220> tricky<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
now this weapon was a little tricky to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160 
now this weapon was a little tricky to
research<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.269> first<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:24.990> still

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
research at first because it's still

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.660 
research at first because it's still
very<00:00:25.470> much<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.949> development<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.550> it's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
very much in development but it's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
very much in development but it's
manufactured<00:00:27.330> by<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> company<00:00:27.630> called<00:00:28.019> Chris

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this is a manufacturer that revolves

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.430 
this is a manufacturer that revolves
around<00:00:35.100> their<00:00:35.670> recoil<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> muzzle<00:00:36.809> climb

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

reduction system which is mainly seen in
there<00:00:40.800> very<00:00:40.829> popular<00:00:41.340> SMG<00:00:42.059> called<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> vector

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
there very popular SMG called the vector

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.930 
there very popular SMG called the vector
now<00:00:43.410> they've<00:00:43.559> coined<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.100> action<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.789> ready

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
now they've coined this action get ready

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.810 
now they've coined this action get ready
for<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.450> called<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.110> Chris<00:00:46.530> super<00:00:47.309> v

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
for this it's called the Chris super v

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.660 
for this it's called the Chris super v
or<00:00:48.090> maybe<00:00:48.239> five<00:00:48.600> maybe<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> Roman<00:00:49.440> numeral

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
or maybe five maybe it's a Roman numeral

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.200 
or maybe five maybe it's a Roman numeral
super<00:00:50.670> v<00:00:50.910> system<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.629> KS<00:00:52.260> vs<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
super v system or KS vs and what the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.540 
super v system or KS vs and what the
system<00:00:54.420> does<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.379> can't<00:00:55.710> begin<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> explain

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
system does and I can't begin to explain

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.970 
system does and I can't begin to explain
how<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.079> exactly<00:00:58.079> does<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> basically

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
how it exactly does it but it basically

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.849 
how it exactly does it but it basically
just<00:00:59.609> reduces<00:01:00.449> recoil<00:01:00.750> dramatically<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
just reduces recoil dramatically and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.219 
just reduces recoil dramatically and
also<00:01:02.430> muzzle<00:01:02.820> climb<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.930> talking

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
also muzzle climb so when are we talking

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.780 
also muzzle climb so when are we talking
about<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.439> close-quarters<00:01:04.890> SMG<00:01:05.549> that's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
about a close-quarters SMG that's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
about a close-quarters SMG that's
obviously<00:01:06.240> something<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.930> any<00:01:07.340> military<00:01:08.340> or

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
obviously something that any military or

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
obviously something that any military or
law<00:01:08.549> enforcement<00:01:08.700> agency<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> be

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
law enforcement agency is going to be

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
law enforcement agency is going to be
really<00:01:10.470> interested<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.580> they

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
really interested in and so what they

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700 
really interested in and so what they
tried<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.590> transform<00:01:13.590> that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
tried to do here is transform that

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
tried to do here is transform that
system<00:01:14.189> into<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> pistol<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:15.840> treyarch

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
system into a pistol so I think treyarch

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
system into a pistol so I think treyarch
did<00:01:16.470> an<00:01:16.590> interesting<00:01:17.070> thing<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.490> because

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
did an interesting thing here because

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
did an interesting thing here because
this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.299> still<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:18.869> much<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.259> development

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
this is still very much in development

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.649 
this is still very much in development
and<00:01:19.799> there's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> lot<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.210> mystery

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and there's a lot of you know mystery

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
and there's a lot of you know mystery
surrounding<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.470> pistol<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:22.920> no<00:01:23.189> one's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
surrounding this pistol because no one's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.800 
surrounding this pistol because no one's
even<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.759> fired<00:01:24.090> yet<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> find

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
even see that fired yet if you can find

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.280 
even see that fired yet if you can find
a<00:01:24.960> video<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> please<00:01:25.799> send<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> me<00:01:27.290> it's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
a video on it please send it to me it's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
a video on it please send it to me it's
a<00:01:28.500> very<00:01:29.009> mysterious<00:01:29.460> pistol<00:01:29.970> at<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> moment

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a very mysterious pistol at the moment

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960 
a very mysterious pistol at the moment
because<00:01:30.630> nobody<00:01:30.990> knows<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.409> successful<00:01:31.979> this

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
because nobody knows how successful this

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.569 
because nobody knows how successful this
chaos<00:01:33.329> vs<00:01:33.509> system<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.290> when<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.950> translated

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
chaos vs system is when it's translated

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.940 
chaos vs system is when it's translated
into<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.790> pistol<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.049> far<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.259> its<00:01:37.530> visual

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
into a pistol so as far as its visual

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
into a pistol so as far as its visual
representation<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> game<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.329> gonna

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
representation in the game I'm gonna

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
representation in the game I'm gonna
have<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> say<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.200> did<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> decent<00:01:41.070> job

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
have to say that they did a decent job

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.730 
have to say that they did a decent job
because<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:42.780> done<00:01:43.049> yet<00:01:43.079> believe<00:01:43.530> Amon

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
because it's not done yet believe Amon

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.800 
because it's not done yet believe Amon
in<00:01:43.979> real<00:01:44.159> life<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.340> turak<00:01:45.090> got<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.420> take<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> lot

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
in real life so turak got to take a lot

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.120 
in real life so turak got to take a lot
of<00:01:45.869> liberties<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.590> weapon<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.920> think

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
of liberties with this weapon I think

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.410 
of liberties with this weapon I think
they<00:01:47.220> did<00:01:47.399> pretty<00:01:47.430> well<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:48.030> added<00:01:48.240> some

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
they did pretty well they added some

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
they did pretty well they added some
picatinny<00:01:48.840> rails<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.189> which

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
picatinny rails to it you know which

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.700 
picatinny rails to it you know which
just<00:01:50.759> makes<00:01:51.030> sense<00:01:51.409> pretty<00:01:52.409> much<00:01:52.530> all

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
just makes sense pretty much all

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.230 
just makes sense pretty much all
accessories<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.460> rolling<00:01:53.970> through

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
accessories are rolling through

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
accessories are rolling through
picatinny<00:01:54.869> rails<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> moment<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.890> having

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
picatinny rails at the moment and having

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
picatinny rails at the moment and having
out<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> pistol<00:01:57.530> definitely<00:01:58.530> screamed

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
out on a pistol definitely screamed

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
out on a pistol definitely screamed
futuristic<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> me<00:01:59.909> know<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.540> thing<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
futuristic to me know one thing that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120 
futuristic to me know one thing that
didn't<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:01.229> sense<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.979> side

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
didn't really make sense is on the side

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.499 
didn't really make sense is on the side
of<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.340> weapon<00:02:02.579> there<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> selector<00:02:03.329> lever

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
of the weapon there was a selector lever

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.160 
of the weapon there was a selector lever
and<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.890> says<00:02:05.189> safe<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.939> fire<00:02:06.149> only<00:02:06.840> two

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and it just says safe and fire only two

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
and it just says safe and fire only two
modes<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.000> with<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> weapon<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:09.509> fully

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
modes so with the weapon that's fully

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.479 
modes so with the weapon that's fully
automatic<00:02:10.319> especially<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> pistol<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.160> find<00:02:11.370> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
automatic especially a pistol I find it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.100 
automatic especially a pistol I find it
hard<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.700> believe<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
hard to believe that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.570 
hard to believe that
don't<00:02:12.380> offer<00:02:12.590> some<00:02:12.920> type<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.100> semi-automatic

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
don't offer some type of semi-automatic

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.000 
don't offer some type of semi-automatic
mode<00:02:14.060> but<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> also<00:02:15.140> noticed<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.620> they<00:02:15.800> kind

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
mode but I also noticed that they kind

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.610 
mode but I also noticed that they kind
of<00:02:16.100> just<00:02:16.160> ripped<00:02:16.700> off<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.240> exact<00:02:17.900> selector

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
of just ripped off the exact selector

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.990 
of just ripped off the exact selector
lever<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.980> was<00:02:19.100> on<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> victor<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.820> game

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
lever that was on the victor in the game

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.330 
lever that was on the victor in the game
so<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.540> don't<00:02:21.020> think<00:02:21.200> they<00:02:21.290> really<00:02:21.470> had<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:21.950> in

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
so I don't think they really had that in

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400 
so I don't think they really had that in
mind<00:02:22.670> when<00:02:23.420> they<00:02:23.510> threw<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.810> design<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.320> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
mind when they threw that design on the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.260 
mind when they threw that design on the
weapon<00:02:24.530> they<00:02:25.070> also<00:02:25.250> help<00:02:25.580> us<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:25.820> by<00:02:25.880> letting

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
weapon they also help us out by letting

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.300 
weapon they also help us out by letting
us<00:02:26.390> know<00:02:26.510> clearly<00:02:27.080> what<00:02:27.350> caliber<00:02:27.740> this<00:02:28.010> weapon

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
us know clearly what caliber this weapon

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.820 
us know clearly what caliber this weapon
uses<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.910> 45<00:02:29.360> ACP<00:02:29.840> which<00:02:30.260> there's<00:02:30.500> been<00:02:30.620> some

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
uses the 45 ACP which there's been some

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.160 
uses the 45 ACP which there's been some
debate<00:02:30.980> because<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.580> called<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.850> kap-40<00:02:32.390> so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
debate because it's called the kap-40 so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.720 
debate because it's called the kap-40 so
some<00:02:33.350> people<00:02:33.590> think<00:02:33.710> that<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:34.070> using<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.370> 40

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
some people think that it's using the 40

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.220 
some people think that it's using the 40
Smith<00:02:34.910> &amp;<00:02:34.970> Wesson<00:02:35.390> which<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.720> vector<00:02:36.050> does

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
Smith &amp; Wesson which the vector does

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.590 
Smith &amp; Wesson which the vector does
have<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> variant<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:36.980> uses<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.390> why

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
have a variant that uses that so why

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.270 
have a variant that uses that so why
they<00:02:38.750> called<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.140> kap-40<00:02:39.620> but<00:02:39.920> clearly

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
they called it the kap-40 but clearly

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.699 
they called it the kap-40 but clearly
state<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.940> uses<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.240> 45<00:02:41.660> ACP<00:02:42.110> again<00:02:42.500> I

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
state that it uses the 45 ACP again I

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.260 
state that it uses the 45 ACP again I
don't<00:02:42.920> know<00:02:43.010> now<00:02:43.459> one<00:02:43.640> last<00:02:43.850> thing<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
don't know now one last thing on the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.760 
don't know now one last thing on the
visual<00:02:44.600> representation<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.500> weapon

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
visual representation of the weapon

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.199 
visual representation of the weapon
which<00:02:45.920> again<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.220> think<00:02:46.370> treyarch<00:02:46.940> did<00:02:47.150> a

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
which again I think treyarch did a

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.270 
which again I think treyarch did a
really<00:02:47.570> good<00:02:47.780> job<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.830> doesn't<00:02:49.160> have

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
really good job is that it doesn't have

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.100 
really good job is that it doesn't have
a<00:02:49.310> slide<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.060> pull<00:02:50.300> back<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.900> rack<00:02:51.080> and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
a slide that you pull back to rack and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.900 
a slide that you pull back to rack and
around<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.950> do<00:02:52.070> with<00:02:52.160> most<00:02:52.400> pistols<00:02:52.850> it

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
around like you do with most pistols it

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.790 
around like you do with most pistols it
actually<00:02:53.209> has<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.360> charging<00:02:53.900> handle<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.470> which

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
actually has a charging handle and which

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.530 
actually has a charging handle and which
is<00:02:54.980> what's<00:02:55.340> interesting<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:55.940> we<00:02:56.209> haven't

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
is what's interesting is that we haven't

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.290 
is what's interesting is that we haven't
seen<00:02:56.630> any<00:02:56.959> video<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.430> pistol<00:02:58.880> actually

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
seen any video of the pistol actually

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.850 
seen any video of the pistol actually
being<00:02:59.510> charged<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.230> trailer<00:03:00.560> took<00:03:00.800> some

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
being charged so trailer took some

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.350 
being charged so trailer took some
liberties<00:03:01.130> here<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.820> thought<00:03:02.030> they<00:03:02.180> did<00:03:02.330> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
liberties here and I thought they did a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.780 
liberties here and I thought they did a
pretty<00:03:02.600> decent<00:03:02.840> job<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.800> decent<00:03:04.070> in<00:03:04.310> fact<00:03:04.580> that

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
pretty decent job so decent in fact that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.550 
pretty decent job so decent in fact that
there<00:03:05.090> are<00:03:05.120> some<00:03:05.480> firearm<00:03:05.930> enthusiasts<00:03:06.500> out

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
there are some firearm enthusiasts out

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.080 
there are some firearm enthusiasts out
there<00:03:06.620> who<00:03:06.860> don't<00:03:07.040> even<00:03:07.280> play<00:03:07.459> video<00:03:07.790> games

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
there who don't even play video games

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.030 
there who don't even play video games
that<00:03:08.360> have<00:03:08.480> becoming<00:03:08.900> interested<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.800> black

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
that have becoming interested in black

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.040 
that have becoming interested in black
ops<00:03:10.250> 2<00:03:10.400> footage<00:03:10.850> because<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.660> shows<00:03:11.870> this

seen before now as far as how it
performs<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.800> game<00:03:16.010> I've<00:03:16.190> said<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.760> before<00:03:16.790> and

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
performs in game I've said it before and

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.150 
performs in game I've said it before and
I've<00:03:17.239> mentioned<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.720> many<00:03:17.840> times<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:19.010> has

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
I've mentioned it many times that has

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.220 
I've mentioned it many times that has
never<00:03:19.400> been<00:03:19.580> more<00:03:19.820> possible<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.690> they<00:03:21.049> call

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
never been more possible and they call

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.900 
never been more possible and they call
of<00:03:21.350> duty<00:03:21.590> game<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:21.920> go<00:03:22.040> secondaries<00:03:22.640> only

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
of duty game to go secondaries only

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.550 
of duty game to go secondaries only
because<00:03:23.180> they're<00:03:23.360> just<00:03:23.540> they're<00:03:23.780> no<00:03:24.019> joke<00:03:24.049> and

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
because they're just they're no joke and

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.020 
because they're just they're no joke and
the<00:03:24.620> kap-40<00:03:25.100> is<00:03:25.340> certainly<00:03:25.700> no<00:03:25.910> exception

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
the kap-40 is certainly no exception

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.050 
the kap-40 is certainly no exception
first<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:27.049> all<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.350> fires<00:03:27.590> at<00:03:27.799> 900<00:03:28.519> rounds<00:03:28.670> per

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
first of all it fires at 900 rounds per

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.400 
first of all it fires at 900 rounds per
minute<00:03:29.180> which<00:03:29.450> aside<00:03:29.750> from<00:03:29.900> some<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.260> your

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
minute which aside from some of your

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.860 
minute which aside from some of your
choices<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> submachine<00:03:31.430> gun<00:03:31.790> class<00:03:32.060> is

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
choices in the submachine gun class is

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.229 
choices in the submachine gun class is
definitely<00:03:33.769> above<00:03:34.130> average<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.790> fact<00:03:35.090> it

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
definitely above average in fact it

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.000 
definitely above average in fact it
fires<00:03:35.450> just<00:03:35.720> as<00:03:35.900> quickly<00:03:36.140> as<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> vector<00:03:36.830> and

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
fires just as quickly as the vector and

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.130 
fires just as quickly as the vector and
it<00:03:37.519> has<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.700> three<00:03:37.970> shot<00:03:38.150> kill<00:03:38.390> capacity<00:03:38.930> which

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
it has a three shot kill capacity which

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.630 
it has a three shot kill capacity which
the<00:03:39.290> vector<00:03:39.620> lacks<00:03:39.890> which<00:03:40.250> doesn't<00:03:40.549> make

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
the vector lacks which doesn't make

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.670 
the vector lacks which doesn't make
sense<00:03:40.820> if<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.150> ask<00:03:41.299> me<00:03:41.510> but<00:03:41.959> there<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.320> and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
sense if you ask me but there it is and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.920 
sense if you ask me but there it is and
also<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.430> KS<00:03:43.820> vs<00:03:44.209> system<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.720> we<00:03:44.840> were

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
also that KS vs system that we were

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.660 
also that KS vs system that we were
talking<00:03:45.260> about<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.590> definitely<00:03:46.280> noticeable

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
talking about is definitely noticeable

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.370 
talking about is definitely noticeable
because<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.120> recoil<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.720> very<00:03:47.900> minimal<00:03:48.260> and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
because the recoil is very minimal and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.070 
because the recoil is very minimal and
almost<00:03:48.739> exclusively<00:03:49.730> vertical<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:50.690> even<00:03:50.959> when

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
almost exclusively vertical so even when

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.350 
almost exclusively vertical so even when
you<00:03:51.200> do<00:03:51.350> for<00:03:51.560> recoil<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.370> very<00:03:52.640> very<00:03:52.730> easy

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
you do for recoil it is very very easy

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.120 
you do for recoil it is very very easy
to<00:03:53.570> compensate<00:03:54.110> for<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.410> just<00:03:54.620> drag<00:03:54.860> down

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
to compensate for you just drag down

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.520 
to compensate for you just drag down
with<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:55.970> not<00:03:56.120> only<00:03:56.269> is<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.690> kap-40<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.440> a

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
with it so not only is the kap-40 just a

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.350 
with it so not only is the kap-40 just a
really<00:03:57.920> good<00:03:58.160> close-quarters<00:03:58.790> weapon<00:03:58.820> firing

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
really good close-quarters weapon firing

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.759 
really good close-quarters weapon firing
900<00:03:59.870> rounds<00:03:59.959> per<00:04:00.170> minute<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.470> getting<00:04:00.709> that

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
900 rounds per minute and getting that

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.530 
900 rounds per minute and getting that
three<00:04:01.070> shot<00:04:01.250> kill<00:04:01.489> capacity<00:04:01.970> but<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.269> also<00:04:02.420> a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
three shot kill capacity but it's also a

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.170 
three shot kill capacity but it's also a
pretty<00:04:02.900> decent<00:04:03.320> mid-range<00:04:03.500> weapon

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
pretty decent mid-range weapon

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.580 
pretty decent mid-range weapon
surprisingly<00:04:05.180> because<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.720> recoil<00:04:06.140> is<00:04:06.380> very

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
surprisingly because the recoil is very

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.500 
surprisingly because the recoil is very
easily<00:04:06.830> compensated<00:04:07.670> for<00:04:07.880> now<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.239> thing

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
easily compensated for now the thing

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.300 
easily compensated for now the thing
that<00:04:08.660> gets<00:04:08.780> people<00:04:09.110> into<00:04:09.350> trouble<00:04:09.500> including

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
that gets people into trouble including

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.430 
that gets people into trouble including
myself<00:04:10.459> with<00:04:10.850> this<00:04:10.970> weapon<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.360> most<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:11.840> its

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
myself with this weapon the most is its

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.979 
myself with this weapon the most is its
magazine<00:04:12.680> sizes<00:04:13.430> it's<00:04:13.730> 15<00:04:14.269> rounds<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.780> even

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
magazine sizes it's 15 rounds and even

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.170 
magazine sizes it's 15 rounds and even
with<00:04:15.140> extended<00:04:15.650> mags<00:04:15.680> it's<00:04:16.130> only<00:04:16.400> 20<00:04:16.820> rounds

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
with extended mags it's only 20 rounds

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.509 
with extended mags it's only 20 rounds
so<00:04:17.630> firing<00:04:17.989> at<00:04:18.079> 900<00:04:18.650> rounds<00:04:18.769> per<00:04:19.070> minute<00:04:19.190> you

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
so firing at 900 rounds per minute you

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.510 
so firing at 900 rounds per minute you
are<00:04:19.700> expelling<00:04:20.090> your<00:04:20.299> entire<00:04:20.599> magazine

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
are expelling your entire magazine

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.219 
are expelling your entire magazine
extremely<00:04:22.520> quickly<00:04:22.789> despite<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.990> lot<00:04:24.200> of

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
extremely quickly despite that a lot of

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.480 
extremely quickly despite that a lot of
people<00:04:24.410> are<00:04:24.620> arguing<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:25.280> is

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
people are arguing that this is

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.790 
people are arguing that this is
the<00:04:25.580> best<00:04:25.849> pistol<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.389> game<00:04:26.599> and<00:04:27.199> it's<00:04:27.680> so

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
the best pistol in the game and it's so

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.350 
the best pistol in the game and it's so
funny<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.130> every<00:04:28.610> pistol<00:04:29.000> with<00:04:29.240> the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
funny that every pistol with the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.969 
funny that every pistol with the
exception<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.050> execution<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:30.680> which<00:04:30.800> you

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
exception of the execution in which you

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.070 
exception of the execution in which you
should<00:04:31.220> know<00:04:31.370> my<00:04:31.520> thoughts<00:04:31.699> on<00:04:31.970> by<00:04:32.150> now<00:04:32.330> every

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
should know my thoughts on by now every

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.689 
should know my thoughts on by now every
pistol<00:04:33.440> has<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.620> group<00:04:33.949> of<00:04:34.039> people<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.460> say

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
pistol has a group of people that say

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.610 
pistol has a group of people that say
it's<00:04:34.849> the<00:04:35.030> best<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.569> I<00:04:35.900> think<00:04:35.960> that's<00:04:36.169> just<00:04:36.440> a

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
it's the best and I think that's just a

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.650 
it's the best and I think that's just a
great<00:04:36.949> thing<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.430> just<00:04:37.639> screams<00:04:38.240> out<00:04:38.449> that

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
great thing that just screams out that

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.480 
great thing that just screams out that
they<00:04:38.780> did<00:04:38.990> really<00:04:39.530> great<00:04:39.800> things<00:04:40.099> with<00:04:40.310> all

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
they did really great things with all

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.969 
they did really great things with all
the<00:04:40.610> all<00:04:40.819> the<00:04:40.849> pistols<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:42.289> they<00:04:42.440> made<00:04:42.620> each

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
the all the pistols and they made each

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.040 
the all the pistols and they made each
one<00:04:43.430> better<00:04:44.000> in<00:04:44.090> some<00:04:44.509> different<00:04:44.930> way

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
one better in some different way

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.050 
one better in some different way
depending<00:04:45.470> on<00:04:45.560> what<00:04:45.740> your<00:04:45.860> skill<00:04:46.130> set<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.370> for

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
depending on what your skill set is for

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.969 
depending on what your skill set is for
me<00:04:47.180> personally<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.720> still<00:04:48.080> love<00:04:48.319> the<00:04:48.349> tac-45

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
me personally I still love the tac-45

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.670 
me personally I still love the tac-45
for<00:04:49.610> me<00:04:49.789> I<00:04:50.060> think<00:04:50.690> that's<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.990> best<00:04:51.110> secondary

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
for me I think that's the best secondary

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.770 
for me I think that's the best secondary
just<00:04:52.370> because<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.669> matches<00:04:52.880> my<00:04:53.210> skill<00:04:53.479> set<00:04:53.509> the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
just because it matches my skill set the

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.749 
just because it matches my skill set the
best<00:04:53.960> but<00:04:54.560> there's<00:04:54.740> still<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:54.979> lot<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.400> say

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
best but there's still a lot to say

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.430 
best but there's still a lot to say
about<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:56.120> kap-40<00:04:56.599> especially<00:04:57.139> if<00:04:57.229> you're<00:04:57.410> a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
about the kap-40 especially if you're a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.670 
about the kap-40 especially if you're a
sniper<00:04:57.770> or<00:04:58.460> someone<00:04:58.880> who<00:04:59.229> can't<00:05:00.229> quite

sniper or someone who can't quite
compete<00:05:01.099> with<00:05:01.220> their<00:05:01.370> primary<00:05:01.819> weapon<00:05:02.210> with

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
compete with their primary weapon with

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.969 
compete with their primary weapon with
some<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.750> these<00:05:02.840> smgs<00:05:03.349> up<00:05:03.470> close<00:05:03.650> because<00:05:03.800> I

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
some of these smgs up close because I

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.649 
some of these smgs up close because I
can<00:05:04.190> tell<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.520> without<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:05.000> doubt<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.539> when

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
can tell you without a doubt that when

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.629 
can tell you without a doubt that when
you're<00:05:05.840> whipping<00:05:06.080> out<00:05:06.259> your<00:05:06.319> kap-40<00:05:06.949> you<00:05:07.430> will

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
you're whipping out your kap-40 you will

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.240 
you're whipping out your kap-40 you will
compete<00:05:08.000> with<00:05:08.210> other<00:05:08.389> people<00:05:08.870> using<00:05:09.199> smgs<00:05:09.770> for

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
compete with other people using smgs for

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.740 
compete with other people using smgs for
the<00:05:10.340> first<00:05:10.550> 15<00:05:10.880> rounds<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.330> firefight

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
the first 15 rounds of the firefight

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.899 
the first 15 rounds of the firefight
you're<00:05:12.050> kind<00:05:12.289> of<00:05:12.349> screwed<00:05:12.500> after<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:13.009> but

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
you're kind of screwed after that but

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.089 
you're kind of screwed after that but
think<00:05:14.330> about<00:05:14.449> it<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.840> fires<00:05:15.110> a<00:05:15.229> 900<00:05:15.770> rounds<00:05:15.830> per

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
think about it it fires a 900 rounds per

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.040 
think about it it fires a 900 rounds per
minute<00:05:16.220> which<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.639> comparable<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.180> other<00:05:17.419> smgs

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
minute which is comparable to other smgs

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.230 
minute which is comparable to other smgs
has<00:05:18.229> a<00:05:18.259> three<00:05:18.530> hit<00:05:18.710> kill<00:05:18.919> capacity<00:05:19.460> it's<00:05:19.970> only

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
has a three hit kill capacity it's only

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.809 
has a three hit kill capacity it's only
two<00:05:20.449> of<00:05:20.599> the<00:05:20.659> SMGs<00:05:21.199> have<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.740> its<00:05:22.190> recoil<00:05:22.580> is

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
two of the SMGs have and its recoil is

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.240 
two of the SMGs have and its recoil is
extremely<00:05:23.780> manageable<00:05:24.380> so<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:24.860> think<00:05:24.979> this

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
extremely manageable so I think this

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.740 
extremely manageable so I think this
weapon<00:05:25.610> is<00:05:25.699> great<00:05:26.120> for<00:05:26.330> those<00:05:26.449> people<00:05:26.569> who

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
weapon is great for those people who

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.080 
weapon is great for those people who
usually<00:05:27.110> use<00:05:27.530> long-range<00:05:27.919> primaries<00:05:28.819> but

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
usually use long-range primaries but

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.520 
usually use long-range primaries but
find<00:05:29.330> themselves<00:05:29.389> suffering<00:05:30.199> at<00:05:30.320> close

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
find themselves suffering at close

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.290 
find themselves suffering at close
quarters<00:05:30.560> with<00:05:30.919> those<00:05:31.250> primaries<00:05:31.789> whether<00:05:32.180> it

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
quarters with those primaries whether it

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.550 
quarters with those primaries whether it
be<00:05:32.389> because<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.810> don't<00:05:33.020> have<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.229> trigger

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
be because you don't have the trigger

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.749 
be because you don't have the trigger
finger<00:05:33.860> necessary<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.520> make<00:05:34.639> the

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
finger necessary to make the

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.279 
finger necessary to make the
semi-automatic<00:05:35.210> weapons<00:05:35.810> work<00:05:36.020> at<00:05:36.229> a

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
semi-automatic weapons work at a

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.080 
semi-automatic weapons work at a
close-range<00:05:36.860> or<00:05:37.370> because<00:05:37.729> you<00:05:37.849> don't<00:05:38.030> have

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
close-range or because you don't have

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.670 
close-range or because you don't have
your<00:05:38.270> reaction<00:05:38.719> time<00:05:38.900> required<00:05:39.289> for<00:05:39.349> some<00:05:39.620> of

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
your reaction time required for some of

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.959 
your reaction time required for some of
the<00:05:39.740> sniper<00:05:40.009> rifles<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.490> be<00:05:40.580> effective

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
the sniper rifles to be effective

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.939 
the sniper rifles to be effective
effective<00:05:41.509> in<00:05:41.750> closer<00:05:41.960> ranges<00:05:42.380> this<00:05:42.740> weapon

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
effective in closer ranges this weapon

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.469 
effective in closer ranges this weapon
will<00:05:43.099> certainly<00:05:43.490> round<00:05:43.789> out<00:05:43.940> your<00:05:43.969> class<00:05:44.270> and

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
will certainly round out your class and

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.790 
will certainly round out your class and
give<00:05:44.599> you<00:05:44.659> a<00:05:44.719> lot<00:05:44.840> more<00:05:44.870> versatility<00:05:45.440> because

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
give you a lot more versatility because

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.260 
give you a lot more versatility because
I<00:05:46.340> think<00:05:46.400> it's<00:05:46.669> one<00:05:46.789> of<00:05:46.849> the<00:05:46.909> more<00:05:47.030> forgiving

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
I think it's one of the more forgiving

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.600 
I think it's one of the more forgiving
pistols<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.050> lot<00:05:48.440> more<00:05:48.590> so<00:05:48.830> than<00:05:49.009> than<00:05:49.310> any<00:05:49.490> of

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
pistols a lot more so than than any of

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.920 
pistols a lot more so than than any of
the<00:05:49.669> other<00:05:49.849> pistols<00:05:50.270> if<00:05:50.389> you<00:05:50.509> ask<00:05:50.630> me<00:05:50.810> it's

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
the other pistols if you ask me it's

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.749 
the other pistols if you ask me it's
just<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.199> the<00:05:51.320> fully<00:05:51.500> automatic<00:05:52.070> capacity<00:05:52.580> I

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
just that the fully automatic capacity I

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.240 
just that the fully automatic capacity I
really<00:05:53.270> helps<00:05:53.509> out<00:05:53.599> people<00:05:53.990> who<00:05:54.500> are<00:05:54.860> really

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
really helps out people who are really

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.270 
really helps out people who are really
great<00:05:56.090> with<00:05:56.300> semi-automatic<00:05:56.630> weapons<00:05:57.409> and

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
great with semi-automatic weapons and

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.740 
great with semi-automatic weapons and
also<00:05:58.669> for<00:05:58.819> people<00:05:58.880> who<00:05:59.150> don't<00:05:59.360> have<00:05:59.419> a<00:05:59.539> great

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.209 
also for people who don't have a great
name<00:05:59.900> because<00:06:00.169> you<00:06:00.259> can<00:06:00.440> compensate<00:06:00.889> as

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
name because you can compensate as

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:02.200 
name because you can compensate as
you're<00:06:01.340> holding<00:06:01.580> down<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.789> trigger<00:06:01.969> but<00:06:02.120> you

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
you're holding down the trigger but you

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.120 
you're holding down the trigger but you

up all my research on the pistols and
black<00:06:29.060> ops<00:06:29.300> 2<00:06:29.539> so<00:06:30.289> it<00:06:30.380> does<00:06:30.530> bring<00:06:30.710> up<00:06:30.830> a<00:06:30.979> very

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
black ops 2 so it does bring up a very

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.499 
black ops 2 so it does bring up a very
interesting<00:06:31.729> question<00:06:31.849> that<00:06:32.150> I<00:06:32.210> get<00:06:32.270> to<00:06:32.419> ask

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509

in this video actually it's two
questions<00:06:34.580> but<00:06:34.789> if<00:06:35.029> you<00:06:35.180> haven't<00:06:35.449> seen<00:06:35.599> every

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
represented as closely to real life as

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.670 
represented as closely to real life as
possible<00:06:49.789> and<00:06:50.300> which<00:06:50.899> pistol<00:06:51.259> do<00:06:51.349> you<00:06:51.439> think
