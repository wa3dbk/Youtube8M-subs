details enough to answer that if the

then<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:44.090> think<00:02:45.090> it'll<00:02:46.050> it'll<00:02:46.350> happen<00:02:46.620> um<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
then I think it'll it'll happen um I

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.050 
then I think it'll it'll happen um I
mean<00:02:49.019> that's<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.320> Technic<00:02:50.060> technological

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
mean that's the Technic technological

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.420 
mean that's the Technic technological
hurdles<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.720> could<00:02:52.350> possibly<00:02:52.769> stop<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.310> from

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
hurdles that could possibly stop it from

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.910 
hurdles that could possibly stop it from
happening<00:02:53.610> um<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:55.319> I'm<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.739> going<00:02:55.890> off

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
happening um and this I'm just going off

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.380 
happening um and this I'm just going off
the<00:02:56.069> top<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.250> my<00:02:56.400> head<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.670> don't<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:57.090> enough

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
the top of my head I don't have enough

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.910 
the top of my head I don't have enough
details<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.959> make<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.290> decision<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:58.830> i'm

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
details to make that decision but i'm

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.309 
details to make that decision but i'm
just<00:02:59.069> doing<00:02:59.550> hypothetical<00:03:00.269> here<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:01.080> say<00:03:01.290> that

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
just doing hypothetical here to say that

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.100 
just doing hypothetical here to say that
if<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.190> could<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:03.569> don't<00:03:03.750> think<00:03:03.959> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
if it could do it you don't think it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.280 
if it could do it you don't think it
will<00:03:04.260> um<00:03:05.030> people<00:03:06.030> i'm<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.690> parallel<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
will um people i'm on the parallel to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.350 
will um people i'm on the parallel to
the<00:03:07.380> iphone<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> lot<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.069> people<00:03:08.190> stream<00:03:09.150> today

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
the iphone a lot of people stream today

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.840 
the iphone a lot of people stream today
on<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> iphone<00:03:10.319> with<00:03:11.100> video<00:03:11.459> because<00:03:11.760> the

on the iphone with video because the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.039 
on the iphone with video because the
processor<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.420> capable<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.049> doing<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
processor is capable of doing it and the

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.590 
processor is capable of doing it and the

a video card or whatever the video chip

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.990 
a video card or whatever the video chip
but<00:03:21.630> Apple<00:03:21.989> didn't<00:03:22.320> implement<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.370> they

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
but Apple didn't implement it so they

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.270 
but Apple didn't implement it so they
had<00:03:24.180> other<00:03:24.390> reasons<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:25.350> we<00:03:25.769> may<00:03:25.980> not<00:03:26.130> know

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
had other reasons that we may not know

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.680 
had other reasons that we may not know
about<00:03:26.400> they<00:03:26.790> may<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.000> been<00:03:27.090> political<00:03:27.600> they

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
about they may have been political they

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.080 
about they may have been political they
may<00:03:27.810> even<00:03:27.840> take<00:03:28.560> tech<00:03:29.010> technology<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.820> don't

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
may even take tech technology I don't

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.740 
may even take tech technology I don't
know<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:31.610> long<00:03:32.610> story<00:03:32.880> short<00:03:33.030> long<00:03:33.480> winded

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
know so long story short long winded

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.340 
know so long story short long winded
answer<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.260> short<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:35.130> think<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:36.390> can<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:36.900> used

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
answer is short I think it can be used

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.580 
answer is short I think it can be used
but<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.799> think<00:03:38.040> there's<00:03:38.250> some<00:03:38.609> dependence<00:03:39.150> that

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
but I think there's some dependence that

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.190 
but I think there's some dependence that
I<00:03:40.590> don't<00:03:40.829> know<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.100> details<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.609> um<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:42.840> don't

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
I don't know the details of um I don't

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.860 
I don't know the details of um I don't
have<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.470> dsi<00:03:43.920> I'd<00:03:44.430> like<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.910> dsi<00:03:45.359> but<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.720> don't

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
have a dsi I'd like a dsi but I don't

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.170 
have a dsi I'd like a dsi but I don't
have<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.109> dsi<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:46.890> can't<00:03:47.220> really<00:03:47.459> give<00:03:48.150> you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
have a dsi so I can't really give you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.750 
have a dsi so I can't really give you
firsthand<00:03:48.570> experience<00:03:49.170> on<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.700> dsi<00:03:50.700> is

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
firsthand experience on that dsi is

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.670 
firsthand experience on that dsi is
still<00:03:51.090> fairly<00:03:51.359> new<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:52.170> lot<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.320> people<00:03:52.560> are

sandy<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.049> hope<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.560> answer<00:04:01.799> your<00:04:01.890> question<00:04:02.220> is

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
sandy I hope I answer your question is

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.039 
sandy I hope I answer your question is
good<00:04:02.459> enough<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.880> try<00:04:03.090> not<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.390> too<00:04:03.420> vague<00:04:03.810> I

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
good enough I try not to be too vague I

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.349 
good enough I try not to be too vague I
don't<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.799> dsi<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.640> can<00:04:05.820> only<00:04:05.940> speculate

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
don't have a dsi so I can only speculate

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.769 
don't have a dsi so I can only speculate
in<00:04:06.630> some<00:04:06.810> areas<00:04:07.140> so<00:04:07.530> take<00:04:07.739> care
