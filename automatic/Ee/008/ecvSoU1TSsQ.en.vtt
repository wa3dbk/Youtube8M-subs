this in the build in just a minute
initially<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.630> first<00:00:18.869> thoughts<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
initially the first thoughts on the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.570 
initially the first thoughts on the
difference<00:00:19.800> between<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.160> quads<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
difference between the quads and the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.310 
difference between the quads and the
quantou<00:00:20.880> vandal<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.480> quanta<00:00:21.869> has<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
quantou vandal is the quanta has the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
quantou vandal is the quanta has the
beautiful<00:00:22.650> status<00:00:23.400> chance<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:24.269> talked

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
beautiful status chance have talked

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.179 
beautiful status chance have talked
about<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> videos<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> couple<00:00:25.470> times<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
about the videos a couple times and it

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.400 
about the videos a couple times and it
has<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.519> nice<00:00:26.699> magazine<00:00:27.000> size<00:00:27.689> increase

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
has that nice magazine size increase

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.269 
has that nice magazine size increase
especially<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> alternative<00:00:30.269> fire<00:00:30.510> okay

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
especially for the alternative fire okay

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.729 
especially for the alternative fire okay
however<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.460> also<00:00:32.489> feel<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> much

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
however I also feel like it has a much

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.139 
however I also feel like it has a much
slower<00:00:36.860> mo<00:00:37.860> decrease<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> better<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> mole

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
slower mo decrease or a better a mole

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.750 
slower mo decrease or a better a mole
efficiency<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> quanta<00:00:40.829> itself

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
efficiency in it then the quanta itself

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.360 
efficiency in it then the quanta itself
did<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> focus<00:00:44.040> on

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
did so I'm not really going to focus on

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.690 
did so I'm not really going to focus on
ammo<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.270> build<00:00:46.170> per<00:00:46.469> se<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:47.160> I'm

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
ammo in this build per se because I'm

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.290 
ammo in this build per se because I'm
usually<00:00:48.890> able<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.070> keep<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.610> full<00:00:50.910> amount<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
usually able to keep a full amount of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.400 
usually able to keep a full amount of
ammo<00:00:51.510> never<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.140> any<00:00:52.289> problems<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.410> first

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
ammo never really any problems so first

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520 
ammo never really any problems so first

want to just because there's many
different<00:01:44.100> things<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.549> could<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:46.049> change

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
different things I could do to change

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.660 
different things I could do to change
this<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.040> let<00:01:47.159> me<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.250> show<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.549> the

this around but let me just show you the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.149 
this around but let me just show you the
basics<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.990> serration<00:01:49.530> split<00:01:49.799> chamber

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
basics here so serration split chamber

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.819 
basics here so serration split chamber
heavy<00:01:50.430> caliber<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.119> even<00:01:51.500> one<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> few

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
heavy caliber or even one of the few

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
heavy caliber or even one of the few
ones<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> will<00:01:53.399> put<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.880> okay<00:01:54.780> these

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
ones that I will put it on okay these

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
ones that I will put it on okay these
all<00:01:55.229> work<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.799> bring<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.100> your<00:01:56.219> base<00:01:56.460> damage

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
all work to bring up your base damage

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.600 
all work to bring up your base damage
because<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.750> an<00:01:58.020> electrical<00:01:58.649> okay<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
because it's an electrical okay the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.149 
because it's an electrical okay the
electric<00:02:00.170> element<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.040> we're

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
electric element is all it is so we're

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.350 
electric element is all it is so we're
just<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> use<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.640> straight<00:02:03.060> damage

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
just going to use the straight damage

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.649 
just going to use the straight damage
mods<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:04.439> okay<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.219> can't<00:02:05.490> use<00:02:05.670> /<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.329> impact

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and then we're going to play into the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.260 
and then we're going to play into the
fact<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> high<00:02:11.489> status<00:02:11.879> weapon

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
fact that this was a high status weapon

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
fact that this was a high status weapon
as<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.569> see<00:02:12.720> 97<00:02:13.349> point

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
as you can see 97 point

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.110 
as you can see 97 point
three<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:15.720> change<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.430> 97.3<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:17.970> see

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
three we change that 97.3 so you can see

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.430 
three we change that 97.3 so you can see
it<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.900> I'm<00:02:18.960> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> start<00:02:19.200> out<00:02:19.410> with

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
it and so I'm going to start out with

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.320 
it and so I'm going to start out with
high<00:02:19.620> voltage<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.190> thur<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:20.610> trousers<00:02:21.090> going

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
high voltage and thur my trousers going

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.480 
high voltage and thur my trousers going
to<00:02:21.390> give<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.600> this<00:02:21.800> monstrous<00:02:22.800> radiation

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
to give you this monstrous radiation

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.280 
to give you this monstrous radiation
because<00:02:23.610> that's<00:02:23.880> also<00:02:24.270> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> include<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
because that's also going to include the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.280 
because that's also going to include the
electric<00:02:25.800> from<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.490> base<00:02:26.750> okay<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.020> then<00:02:28.170> i'm

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
electric from the base okay and then i'm

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.810 
electric from the base okay and then i'm
going<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.500> use<00:02:28.650> malignant<00:02:29.160> force<00:02:29.370> rhyme

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
going to use malignant force rhyme

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.000 
going to use malignant force rhyme
rounds<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:30.930> infected<00:02:31.470> clip<00:02:31.680> at<00:02:31.830> this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
rounds and in here infected clip at this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.130 
rounds and in here infected clip at this
moment<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.000> viral<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.660> i<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.900> bring<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
moment for the viral so i can bring the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.320 
moment for the viral so i can bring the
viral<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.800> basically<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.460> same<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
viral up to basically the same as the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.830 
viral up to basically the same as the
radiation<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.110> if<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.980> look<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:39.540> were<00:02:39.690> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
radiation so if you look if we were to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.390 
radiation so if you look if we were to
take<00:02:40.020> off<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.650> fact<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.920> clip<00:02:41.130> at<00:02:41.250> this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
take off and in fact the clip at this

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.070 
take off and in fact the clip at this
point<00:02:41.700> you're<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> see<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> big<00:02:42.750> change

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
point you're going to see the big change

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320 
point you're going to see the big change
is<00:02:43.410> only<00:02:43.740> down<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.160> two<00:02:44.340> thousand<00:02:44.850> instead<00:02:45.210> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
is only down to two thousand instead of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.850 
is only down to two thousand instead of
adding<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.080> if<00:02:46.170> i<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.590> third

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
adding this in so if i go with a third

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.250 
adding this in so if i go with a third
former<00:02:47.250> i<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.550> max<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.940> out<00:02:48.120> i<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.930> max<00:02:49.110> out

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
former i can max this out i can max out

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.960 
former i can max this out i can max out
heavy<00:02:49.470> caliber<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> damage<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.730> even

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
heavy caliber and the damage is even

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.780 
heavy caliber and the damage is even
more<00:02:51.420> significant<00:02:52.020> ninety-seven<00:02:52.740> percent

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
more significant ninety-seven percent

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
more significant ninety-seven percent
this<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.030> awesome<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.900> you're<00:02:55.620> using<00:02:55.830> your

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
this is awesome if you're using your

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.210 
this is awesome if you're using your
main<00:02:56.600> beam<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.020> weapon<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.040> don't

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
main beam of the weapon then you don't

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.980 
main beam of the weapon then you don't
kill<00:02:59.490> an<00:02:59.640> enemy<00:02:59.760> you're<00:03:00.570> going<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> definitely

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
kill an enemy you're going to definitely

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.560 
kill an enemy you're going to definitely
proc<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:02.220> radiation<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.970> viral<00:03:03.390> which

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
proc it with radiation and viral which

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.670 
proc it with radiation and viral which
is<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> nice<00:03:03.960> nice<00:03:04.380> thing<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:06.410> but<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.530> can

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
is a nice nice thing to have but you can

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.040 
is a nice nice thing to have but you can
change<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.160> around<00:03:08.280> however<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.510> really

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
i'm going to take let me just take this

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.840 
i'm going to take let me just take this
off<00:03:13.470> for<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.770> second<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.340> quickly<00:03:14.730> show

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
off for a second and just quickly show

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.350 
off for a second and just quickly show
you<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.080> pick<00:03:16.260> out<00:03:16.440> whatever<00:03:17.239> setup<00:03:18.239> you

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
you you can pick out whatever setup you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.199 
you you can pick out whatever setup you
want<00:03:18.570> blast<00:03:18.870> corrosive<00:03:19.590> okay<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.970> want<00:03:21.090> to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
want blast corrosive okay if you want to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.130 
want blast corrosive okay if you want to
go<00:03:21.360> with<00:03:22.010> gas<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.310> magnetic<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.720> can<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:24.959> that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
go with gas and magnetic you can do that

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.720 
go with gas and magnetic you can do that
as<00:03:25.260> well<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.590> i<00:03:25.709> personally<00:03:26.130> i<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:28.580> for<00:03:29.580> this

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
as well and i personally i like for this

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.479 
as well and i personally i like for this
weapon<00:03:30.739> radiation<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:31.890> viral<00:03:32.310> because

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
weapon radiation and viral because

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.090 
weapon radiation and viral because
you're<00:03:32.850> right<00:03:33.180> click<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.739> always<00:03:34.920> be

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you're right click is going to always be

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.370 
you're right click is going to always be
blast<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.180> always<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.510> blast<00:03:36.930> damage

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
blast so you always have blast damage

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.580 
blast so you always have blast damage
okay<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.430> pick<00:03:39.420> out<00:03:39.600> different<00:03:39.840> elements<00:03:40.470> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
okay so pick out different elements is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.710 
okay so pick out different elements is
what<00:03:40.739> i'm<00:03:40.860> thinking<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.370> radiation<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.270> viral

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
what i'm thinking so radiation in viral

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.110 
what i'm thinking so radiation in viral
works<00:03:42.959> out<00:03:43.140> well<00:03:43.290> or<00:03:43.739> even<00:03:44.010> gas<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.640> magnetic

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
works out well or even gas and magnetic

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.600 
works out well or even gas and magnetic
with<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.690> blast<00:03:46.050> damage<00:03:46.470> as<00:03:46.680> well<00:03:46.920> works<00:03:47.340> out

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
with that blast damage as well works out

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.520 
with that blast damage as well works out
to<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:48.540> you've<00:03:48.870> got<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.020> do<00:03:49.170> at<00:03:49.320> this<00:03:49.440> point

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
to so all you've got to do at this point

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.400 
to so all you've got to do at this point
is<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:50.310> build<00:03:50.850> in<00:03:51.209> your<00:03:51.660> difference<00:03:52.140> so

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
is just build in your difference so

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.270 
is just build in your difference so
thermite<00:03:53.250> rounds<00:03:53.610> malignant<00:03:54.030> force<00:03:54.300> here

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
thermite rounds malignant force here

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.530 
thermite rounds malignant force here
well<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.459> case<00:03:56.640> i<00:03:56.850> can<00:03:57.000> still<00:03:57.209> just<00:03:57.360> use

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
well in this case i can still just use

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.170 
well in this case i can still just use
the<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.780> fact<00:03:57.989> clip<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.560> you'll<00:03:59.040> see<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.459> can

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
the in fact clip and you'll see I can

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.729 
the in fact clip and you'll see I can
bring<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.450> gas<00:04:00.630> all<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.050> way<00:04:01.140> up<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.290> where<00:04:01.709> I

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
bring the gas all the way up to where I

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.530 
bring the gas all the way up to where I
want<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.100> be<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.489> there's<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.120> lot<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.330> can

don't want to do it that way there is
one<00:04:35.300> other<00:04:35.330> option<00:04:35.569> you<00:04:36.169> can<00:04:36.470> do<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.629> off

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
one other option you can do that is off

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.300 
one other option you can do that is off
the<00:04:39.169> top<00:04:39.319> of<00:04:39.379> my<00:04:39.470> head<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.860> can<00:04:40.009> find<00:04:40.159> it
