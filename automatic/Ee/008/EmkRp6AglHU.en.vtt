00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.880
 anyway if you feel inside the fan that 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.500

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.690
 creative understanding that between episode 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.690
 because we do n't ask ourselves 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:58.280
 here is entering the bucket of water 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:04.060
 because it will obviously become ice 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.060

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:14.530

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:26.590
 shower which is terribly DVD contains 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.420

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.800
 part of the tax on the table 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:50.040
 bush 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:53.100

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.020
 that water is a guest table 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.010
 from the new spit scenarios that there 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.740
 only four seats are twin ed 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:11.820

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.980
 there are two pigeons these fiction years 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:24.180
 with goods that like a catalina up to 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.180
 taste I believe 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:32.800

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:38.020

 you play today they believed healthy 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:50.250
 principles I would do it but for me but why 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:56.070
 so there were also what was so 21 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.070
 venerate breath account and are therefore always 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:10.990
 Here are the tables and the luxury home 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:15.310
 to show the voice from above is over is 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:18.610
 all I'm great at 5 to 8 hours for this 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:22.050
 about everything here built a 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:29.110
 small described with much sent 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:31.750

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.870
 only born tooth do the Gascon 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:38.500
 meanwhile, because I needed it 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.410
 lower intervenes and health 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.229
 now even if a Brescian panel is 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:48.160
 while remaining implanted, they are not growing 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:53.350
 only he and he will cost the receiver 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.910
