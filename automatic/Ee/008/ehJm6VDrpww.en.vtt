00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
got to have the latest and greatest

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.880 
got to have the latest and greatest
hardware<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.410> you're<00:02:12.730> constantly<00:02:13.810> pushing

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
hardware and you're constantly pushing

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:26.430 
hardware and you're constantly pushing
the<00:02:15.890> limits<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:18.400> hardware<00:02:19.510> capabilities<00:02:24.340> then

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
the limits of hardware capabilities then

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.650 
the limits of hardware capabilities then
you'd<00:02:27.040> probably<00:02:27.400> want<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.030> stay<00:02:28.300> with<00:02:28.330> a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
and also if you're you know if that's

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.630 
and also if you're you know if that's
what<00:02:35.690> you're<00:02:35.840> used<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:37.040> you're
