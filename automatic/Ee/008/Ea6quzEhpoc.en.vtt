your color and not willing to take a few
risks<00:00:20.390> then<00:00:21.080> you<00:00:21.650> might<00:00:21.890> miss<00:00:22.130> out<00:00:22.340> on<00:00:22.550> that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
risks then you might miss out on that

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:35.430 
risks then you might miss out on that
iridescent<00:00:24.289> quality<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:25.820> skin

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.220 

so<00:00:35.980> now<00:00:36.310> that<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:36.550> looks<00:00:37.030> so<00:00:37.300> lit<00:00:37.570> up<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:37.989> just

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
so now that that looks so lit up it just

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.170 
so now that that looks so lit up it just
sort<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.100> make<00:00:39.310> some<00:00:39.580> of<00:00:39.700> these<00:00:39.820> other<00:00:40.090> areas

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
sort of make some of these other areas

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.500 
sort of make some of these other areas
just<00:00:40.810> a<00:00:40.989> little<00:00:41.260> jealous<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:43.030> want<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.329> make

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
just a little jealous you want to make

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.940 
just a little jealous you want to make
sure<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:46.030> whole<00:00:46.330> thing<00:00:46.780> looks<00:00:47.080> equally

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
sure that the whole thing looks equally

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.250 
sure that the whole thing looks equally
lit<00:00:48.340> it's<00:00:48.850> believable<00:00:49.270> that<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.690> same<00:00:49.960> light

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
lit it's believable that the same light

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.759 
lit it's believable that the same light
source<00:00:50.680> is<00:00:50.980> reacting<00:00:51.670> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:53.050> whole<00:00:53.320> painting

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
source is reacting on the whole painting

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.299 
source is reacting on the whole painting
and<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:55.660> where<00:00:55.960> relativity<00:00:56.650> really<00:00:57.010> comes

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
and that's where relativity really comes

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.530 
and that's where relativity really comes
in<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:59.290> nothing<00:00:59.830> can<00:01:00.610> exist<00:01:01.059> in<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:01.420> of

in that nothing can exist in and of

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.630 
in that nothing can exist in and of
itself<00:01:01.960> it's<00:01:02.260> just<00:01:02.500> relative<00:01:03.040> to<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.370> whole

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
that makes it good or bad there's no

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.900 
that makes it good or bad there's no

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
there's no correct skin color if you

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.090 
there's no correct skin color if you
look<00:01:12.399> at<00:01:12.520> Rembrandt's<00:01:13.060> self-portraits<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
look at Rembrandt's self-portraits you

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.650 
look at Rembrandt's self-portraits you
know<00:01:15.190> he<00:01:15.340> painted<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:15.850> lot<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.270> them<00:01:16.450> I'm<00:01:16.630> sure

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
know he painted a lot of them I'm sure

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.749 
know he painted a lot of them I'm sure
over<00:01:17.020> fifty<00:01:17.770> maybe<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.729> hundred<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:20.130> he<00:01:21.130> you

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
over fifty maybe a hundred and he you

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.700 
over fifty maybe a hundred and he you
know<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:22.180> hardly<00:01:22.450> ever<00:01:22.539> see<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:23.050> same<00:01:23.289> skin

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
know you hardly ever see the same skin

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.010 
know you hardly ever see the same skin
color<00:01:23.740> twice<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.880> yet<00:01:25.630> they're<00:01:25.840> all

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
color twice and yet they're all

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.380 
color twice and yet they're all
Rembrandt<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:26.979> how<00:01:27.130> do<00:01:27.190> you<00:01:27.340> explain<00:01:27.759> that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
Rembrandt so how do you explain that

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.310 
Rembrandt so how do you explain that
it's<00:01:29.380> because<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.950> color<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:31.750> just<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
it's because the color not just of the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.080 
it's because the color not just of the
skin<00:01:32.649> but<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:32.979> color<00:01:33.250> scheme<00:01:33.759> of<00:01:33.789> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
skin but the color scheme of the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.160 
skin but the color scheme of the
painting<00:01:34.630> is<00:01:34.840> like<00:01:35.590> choosing<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.430> key<00:01:36.910> in<00:01:37.330> music

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
painting is like choosing a key in music

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.089 
painting is like choosing a key in music
