00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi to all these guys so szczesny cats 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.640
 and how is it going less is it okay 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.410
 and today a new technique 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.330
 resale purchase for the pool and more 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.710
 robust and so it goes in the budget 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.490
 58.70 in credit even more 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.289
 so the technique 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.850
 once again very simple 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.230
 but before it starts put a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.390
 little inch well on the video it's 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.920
 because here I can also you 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.789
 two sides of videos say me in the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.740
 comments if you want me to do 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 a video for the small budget average 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.929
 budgets or big budget look at this 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.289
 video until the end for for everything 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840
 know 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.559
 the good evolution of twitter 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 subscribe summation and injury 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.950
 or twitter on facebook sud and me 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 everywhere not in the street the technique 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.579
 So, what are we going to do? 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 take a player 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.039
 finally we will first take these three 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 styles so these catalyst hunters and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 shadows since the young english I know 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.309
 not why so we will take 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 hunters we will do gold we go in bp 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.609
 she is going to put 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.090
 we will go to the 5000 credit 6.7 me 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.110
 credit sees normal to 5000 credit on 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.439
 will see more or less the days they 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.350
 are there 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.070
 so we had to adebayor we had to have abbas jami 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.170
 bonus did not have adebayor and bonus so we 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.479
 will drink donors do not 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.580
 shadow no catalyst never again 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.259
 hunter none has only one so it's not 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.430
 all not at all interesting because he 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.380
 must still compete with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.860
 the other players so that's 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.439
 interesting 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.350
 there we have beautiful nor simple nor credit 7009 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.600
 him a thousand so that's very interesting 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.579
 33 very interesting contract so this 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.740
 we are going to do we will buy you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.470
 have had time jack we will sign it 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 directly and we will place it at 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 why not 6500 credit for a 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.280
 hour 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.380
 that's all it takes and now 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.370
 we will do the same with the catalysts 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.650
 now 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.790
 catalyst there we will go up to how much 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.120
 go up we 'll go up to some again 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:09.180
 once we will see what we are going to climb 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:12.480
 4 min is gold bpl 4000 so catalyst 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.510
 catalyst since still catalyst is 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.620
 yes it's +33 speed +32 pass so we 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.250
 going down there are a lot of players 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.810
 we will see 3000 4000 fall down again 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.000
 many players are still going 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:32.410
 December to 2000 there is that l zogbia this 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.720
 show like so here we have it we'll see 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.130
 the players so at 2001 in 2001 we have 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.410
 all seen line nation hewson we 'll see 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.560
 chamberlain and sigurdsson in catalyst 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.180
 so strong that catalyst 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.970
 So this is where so again 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.390
 it's not interesting not having a 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.650
 sigerson daughter there are two in 2005 a 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.910
 2001 so that's not too much 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.260
 interesting we can buy it put it 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.380
 to 2004 but hey it does not much 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.640
 thus profit it's okay we will 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 I saw that there was a wanyama 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.430
 also victor wanyama so he was at 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.300
 2005 under the trunk not so here it is 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.000
 the only area is not too much 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.020
 interesting now we have a number 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.489
 for many we will do the same 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.450
 sorry you have something to say is that 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.830
 this technique works a little bit 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.709
 less on pc seen that the market a lot 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.080
 smaller than on console that's 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.610
 pity but tell me it works again 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.510
 better especially the others on all 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.970
 other platforms 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.630
 so what are we going to lower 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.280
 still a little hard to find 5 30 and 5 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.370
 So what was then know how very 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.069
 few players so I remember that 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.500
 shadows we know more three speeds and 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.840
 +3 defense we will see so now 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.519
 we have fazio face of it can be 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.629
 interesting 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.159
 we have we have we haveiamson 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.060
 spent really interesting that there I 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.140
 do not think it's really interesting 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.769
 so it's mostly of course 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.840
 coloccini advocates i'm not sure 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.549
 so we'll see we'll see fazio 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.730
 why not hop 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:14.890
 fazio so has all a good keyboard is 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.959
 something super fabio this one 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.160
 put in numbers 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.970
 we will see what he has there is 2 1 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.500
 3009 1,3005 do not really know a lot 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.400
 we will see other players in numbers 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.949
 why not we will climb up to 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.260
 4005 this time we are going to go back to 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:37.870
 4005 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:43.389
 then agreed the shot so there again 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:47.710
 is interested sagna sagna 4000 smalling 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:52.690
 4005 distinct 4000 so we have hasania 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.650
 distinct and small and we start again 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.970
 throw molines since precisely 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.780
 forget it on a shadow and that has only one 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.820
 so again it's not 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.610
 interesting 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.070
 sagna shadow no longer has to iginla several 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.639
 4000 or Catherine yes it's very 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.090
 interesting 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.770
 there you take with calculations not be 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.310
 in europe there is one against one but it is 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.669
 not too serious 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.570
 we can easily put to 6000 my 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.770
 facebook a drama fart a cable I know 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.620
 so 6000 credit up 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.240
 I left who else with 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:36.580
 others and with whom you fucking have I 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:39.340
 forgot I forgot they had I 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.400
 knew I was going to forget standoff at 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.350
 distance here I knew I knew I knew 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.590
 know I waded your mouth no but 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.700
 not all so the distinct shadow walker 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.270
 aquin and so again it's 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.800
 not interesting 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.710
 So here we have seen what I did to 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.120
 some very good shopping 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.710
 some very good shopping which there with 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.230
 all that is you more or less suffered 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.980
 I did that while I did it on 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.000
 my other account for several 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.040
 during how long during 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.310
 two hours I think I got 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.370
 easily made serious there I went 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.740
 from 80 to 137 miles 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.950
 so it's more or less 50 57 thousand 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.210
 credit in two hours so that's it 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.530
 still a lot of the Christian has us so 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.520
 you know but this video put a 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.230
 green thumb on Thursday but it's going to look 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.800
 subscribers or it's not already done go on 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.050
 Facebook 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.610
 follow me everywhere except until 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.970
 in the toilet thanks a hammer and 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.970
 ciao
