here these guys right here and between

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.540 
here these guys right here and between
the<00:00:53.910> bolsters<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.570> thing<00:00:55.190> this<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

make a sheep wagon we really need to
have<00:01:02.670> bolsters<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.049> between<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
have bolsters the in between the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.070 
have bolsters the in between the
bolsters<00:01:05.010> 42<00:01:05.430> inches<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.820> 38<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.960> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
here this is a little bit puffed out

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.149 
here this is a little bit puffed out
right<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.040> also<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> left<00:01:31.500> left

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
right there also this is the left left

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.399 
right there also this is the left left
rear<00:01:32.430> wheel<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.770> left<00:01:35.520> front<00:01:35.880> wheel

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
rear wheel this is the left front wheel

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.679 
rear wheel this is the left front wheel
and<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.740> isn't<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.189> bad<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.909> left<00:01:39.270> rear

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and this one isn't is bad that left rear

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.149 
and this one isn't is bad that left rear
is<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.079> worst<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.500> them<00:01:42.710> but<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.860> actually

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
is the worst of them but it's actually

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.870 
is the worst of them but it's actually
in<00:01:44.250> pretty<00:01:44.430> decent<00:01:44.640> shape<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.240> its<00:01:45.360> age

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.250 

it's<00:01:50.420> got<00:01:50.540> all<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.810> good<00:01:50.840> old<00:01:51.110> metal<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:54.110> then

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
it's got all the good old metal and then

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.950 
it's got all the good old metal and then
this<00:01:54.410> is<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.680> tongue<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.780> pretty

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
this is the tongue and this is pretty

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.950 
this is the tongue and this is pretty
long<00:02:00.170> I'll<00:02:00.470> give<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.740> measure<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.070> here

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
long I'll give you a measure in here

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.010 
long I'll give you a measure in here
this<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.020> approximately<00:02:04.750> we<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:05.870> about

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
this is approximately we have about

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.090 
this is approximately we have about
eleven<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.470> half<00:02:06.500> feet<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:09.649> that's<00:02:09.920> what

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
eleven and a half feet so that's what

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.060 
eleven and a half feet so that's what
the<00:02:10.220> look<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.520> here<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.590> perfect<00:02:12.950> for

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
the look is here this is perfect for

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.040 
the look is here this is perfect for
building<00:02:13.220> sheep<00:02:13.520> wagons<00:02:13.880> on<00:02:14.000> I've<00:02:14.780> built

three of them now in fact that one of
them<00:02:17.210> over<00:02:17.360> there<00:02:17.480> that's<00:02:18.410> silver<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.310> copper

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
them over there that's silver the copper

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.590 
them over there that's silver the copper
colored<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.700> here's<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.090> right<00:02:23.270> front

need<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.920> wheels<00:02:44.130> redone<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.819> you're

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
need to have the wheels redone if you're

need to have the wheels redone if you're
going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> pull<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> down<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.470> road<00:02:47.030> with

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

also got another spreader already
pre-built<00:03:00.989> right<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:01.730> because<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.850> think

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
pre-built right here because I do think

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.449 
pre-built right here because I do think

running<00:03:10.680> gear<00:03:10.910> actually<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.150> might<00:03:12.300> just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
running gear actually that might just

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.420
