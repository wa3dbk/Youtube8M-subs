00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
you know really encapsulated all the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.280 
you know really encapsulated all the

and<00:02:18.680> really<00:02:19.370> did<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.910> very<00:02:19.940> sensible<00:02:20.630> way

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and really did it in a very sensible way

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.270 
and really did it in a very sensible way
that<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.080> can<00:02:21.230> see<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.830> still<00:02:22.250> a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
that you can see that it is still a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.370 
that you can see that it is still a
ghost<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.510> when<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> put<00:02:23.780> them<00:02:23.990> side<00:02:24.170> by<00:02:24.200> side

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
ghost but when you put them side by side

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.290 
ghost but when you put them side by side
you<00:02:24.800> see<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.160> little<00:02:25.430> measured<00:02:25.850> response

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
you see that little measured response

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.590 
you see that little measured response
