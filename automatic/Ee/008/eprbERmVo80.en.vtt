00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
knowing basically it's three dollars to

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.569 
knowing basically it's three dollars to
turn<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:20.049> price<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.769> going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> cost<00:02:21.129> me<00:02:21.340> six

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
bucks the other thing I would say is a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.949 
bucks the other thing I would say is a
good<00:02:24.760> way<00:02:24.939> to<00:02:24.969> tell<00:02:25.239> whether<00:02:25.390> or<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.689> game

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
good way to tell whether or not a game

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.589 
good way to tell whether or not a game
is<00:02:26.079> winnable<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.760> ask<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.120> person<00:02:28.329> that's

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
is winnable is ask the person that's

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.390 
is winnable is ask the person that's
running<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.019> game<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.769> show<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:30.010> how<00:02:30.219> it
