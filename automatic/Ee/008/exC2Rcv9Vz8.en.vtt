00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 that everyone knows multitouch 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.200
 shing i hope you're fine 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.189
 unpacking the iphone 6 it starts all 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.960
 right now 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.750
 so we start right away with the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.920
 box so this is the iphone 6 as I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.230
 wanted to already said so you see like 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.660
 usually we have the usual packaging 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.310
 so I took the model 64 giga it's 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.800
 the iphone if I have not taken the rn6 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.810
 plus it's true they were really 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.090
 very very expensive i took email frenchies 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 so 64 gigabyte so you see like 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.230
 usually at the back of the box 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.989
 the few imprint it does not have 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.460
 changed on that side we see the relief 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.380
 iphone on the front of the device 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.809
 but now your super sic at 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.420
 unpacking the device in either you 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.370
 see again in our beautiful 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.020
 iphone so j billion years would be 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
 a little bit later for now 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 will be interested in the contents of the box 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.440
 you see again very very 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.280
 class is currently I praying him in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.090
 space grey 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.129
 again very very hungry and so 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.260
 we'll talk about it again after 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.760
 the moment we will be interested in the content 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.009
 so you see again that one 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.950
 in support cock that helps maintain 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.140
 the iphone in place we have the documentation 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.540
 that normally quite a lot of people know 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.100
 if you have ever had was the iphone 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.000
 also the small pin which allows 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.530
 to open the sim card container 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.840
 next with regard to the box one 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.479
 end up with so the headphones so 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.140
 it's the new generation headphones 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.080
 so they're better in the ear 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.050
 is going to say that it is fixed to the wall in the water 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.700
 reign then we have the charger can 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.479
 charge with the president ning 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.399
 obviously we could with the pins 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.800
 there precisely because the recalls this 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.590
 old connectivity is the catch 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.850
 lighting that we now have here 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.300
 again no big 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.399
 new 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.200
 I do not show you everything that is 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.600
 stickers documentation is when 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.570
 even relatively known and we're going 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.409
 now go directly to the iphone 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.740
 in itself 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:08.039
 so this iphone as you can the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.959
 see it's this a double prime by two 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.430
 quickly there will be a presentation a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 little bit later he is very very 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.150
 fast very fluid fingerprint 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.000
 and very beautiful so it's really 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.400
 important for the product still a 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.900
 times you see the ink prices and it is 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.410
 very fine it's really a pleasure 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.810
 to have more buy buy this model 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.640
 so listen here it was an unpacking 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.430
 makes it very short I did not want to make a 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.810
 very very long video dance 2 in a 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.540
 next video i'll show you a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.100
 little bit the features 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.690
 techniques 4 and the presentation a little 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.519
 little more depth of the iphone so 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.800

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.500
