the stitching I would recommend just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
the stitching I would recommend just
taking<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.930> jacket<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> sweater<00:01:13.950> or

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
taking the jacket or the sweater or

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
whatever you're buying or even the jeans

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
whatever you're buying or even the jeans
and<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.680> pull<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.369> little<00:01:17.700> pull<00:01:17.909> them

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.929 
and just pull them up a little pull them
apart<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:19.530> seam<00:01:20.130> should<00:01:20.640> not

apart a little bit your seam should not

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.060 
apart a little bit your seam should not
be<00:01:21.180> pulling<00:01:21.450> apart<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.840> stitching<00:01:22.799> should<00:01:22.830> be

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
be pulling apart the stitching should be

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.240 
be pulling apart the stitching should be
very<00:01:23.400> very<00:01:23.570> tight<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:25.470> shouldn't<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
very very tight it shouldn't have to you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460

know be loose also have to look at the
closeness<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> detail<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
closeness and the detail is the way that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
closeness and the detail is the way that
it<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.450> stitched<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.470> example<00:01:31.920> always

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it was stitched so for example always

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
cotton and micro modal just some kind of

synthetic<00:02:15.540> fiber<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:17.160> has<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.730> resilience

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
synthetic fiber that has that resilience

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.330 
synthetic fiber that has that resilience
resilience<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.200> when<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.440> stretch<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> fiber

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
resilience is when you stretch a fiber

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.730 
resilience is when you stretch a fiber
and<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.850> bounces<00:02:21.240> back<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
and it bounces back up so you have to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.350 
and it bounces back up so you have to
understand<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.130> when<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.430> stretch<00:02:24.060> cotton

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
understand that when you stretch cotton

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.180 
understand that when you stretch cotton
it<00:02:24.690> doesn't<00:02:25.020> bounce<00:02:25.140> back<00:02:25.440> up<00:02:25.620> he<00:02:25.740> has<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> very

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it doesn't bounce back up he has a very

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.820 
it doesn't bounce back up he has a very
it's<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.760> very<00:02:26.970> very<00:02:27.240> poorly<00:02:27.570> resilient<00:02:28.320> fabric

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
it's a very very poorly resilient fabric

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.470 
it's a very very poorly resilient fabric
so<00:02:29.250> whenever<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.700> mixed<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.240> one

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
so whenever it's mixed with one

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.540 
so whenever it's mixed with one
synthetic<00:02:30.990> fiber<00:02:31.260> not<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.770> with<00:02:32.010> synthetic

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
synthetic fiber not one with synthetic

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.670 
synthetic fiber not one with synthetic
fiber<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.210> creates<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.750> much<00:02:33.960> better<00:02:34.140> quality

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
fiber it creates a much better quality

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.710 
fiber it creates a much better quality
product<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.520> don't<00:02:35.790> be<00:02:35.880> fooled<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.240> oh<00:02:36.420> it's

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
product so don't be fooled like oh it's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.180 
product so don't be fooled like oh it's
mixed<00:02:36.990> with<00:02:37.050> synthetics<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.740> must<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:38.070> be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
mixed with synthetics it must not be

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.630 
mixed with synthetics it must not be
that<00:02:38.310> good

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
that good

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.970 
that good

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
always always look for some kind of mix

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.030 
always always look for some kind of mix

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
usually man-made fabrics are cheaper

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.350 
usually man-made fabrics are cheaper
than<00:02:54.810> natural<00:02:55.709> fabrics<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.340> example<00:02:56.880> you
