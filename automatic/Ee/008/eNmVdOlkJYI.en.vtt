00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.480
 Who are you? 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.850
 today I'm going to make a recipe that is 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.640
 very easy and serving special video 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.530
 of the box that is a kate's daily pate goes 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.520
 For you I want to see you make a 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:25.470
 new to us, expecting good revenue 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.470
 the ingredients are 70 grams of garlic 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.590
 225 grams 100 grams Ricotta 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.809
 region we nutmeg salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.579
 and a bit of olive oil I've ever 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.530
 taught you how first step is 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.540
 plan not to get too strong 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 because the area is a lot of rest the people 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.469
 Go get the locker room and we'll do it. 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.329
 a process for decreasing the 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 aggressiveness of the user we go 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 put new on it cover with water 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 covered with cold water and brought to the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.880
 let it boil 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.520
 As soon as we boil, we'll discuss the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.819
 garlic put trust again of this 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.859
 process three times three times after 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:24.310
 since debut and then we'll start 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:26.619
 really do the role is very 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.119
 important in this recipe of power and is the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.509
 quality of the ricotta 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.490
 curd because it will make all the 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.069
 difference in flavor I said 'I'll make you 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.649
 once and is not so good or can be 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.569
 the mark of the marker ricotta cheese 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.159
 so the choice of ingredient is very 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.229
 important to choose the preferred brand of 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.209
 You 're the ones you like the most. 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.529
 ensuring that the problem will become a 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.869
 delicious 

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.939
 I'll wait and see and I already have the 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.560
 I've already done this twice 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.869
 I'm doing the third only to show 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.869
 to record how we do it 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.730
 We already see you, I'm super fast. 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.730
 Now I escape legal liner. 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:18.670
 I will choose this water to leave our 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.870
 paper is tastier and does not put the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.330
 simply bleached oil, I go 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.950
 take the oven will hang and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.040
 then I'm going to hit every 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:37.480
 ingredients only a little bit of olive oil a 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.690
 a little salt and make us go to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.250
 garden has some corn some weed can 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.000
 put together for the sack will give a 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.290
 I like it super cool to add a table 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.720
 Mounted with garlic preheated oven in the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.250
 medium high 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.590
 I'll put it will stay more or less 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.030
 10 minutes until it is golden brown without 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.610
 leaving those who kill us will not stay 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.730
 In the river, I'll be back to show you this 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.709
 year as it was 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.709
 good staff our oil already passed 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:24.690
 the mega warm golden well if you want can 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.160
 make it a bit more logical than that already 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:34.830
 It's ok, let's go the process. 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.900
 first I'll beat the garlic with 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:42.530
 for Saturday and do not stay so 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.530
 heavy 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.530
 ae 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.170
 the people plan I 'm going to open 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.840
 I'll move and I'll knock some more. 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.220
 because I do not think I have the pieces in 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.230
 What do you like with a little bit? 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.230
 let's get well 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.910
 now I'll put the quota 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.469
 to season nutmeg 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.680
 salt and nem 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
 like this 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:34.199
 ah 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:36.060
 to hit a little more I will open or 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:45.080
 move and hit a little more here 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:45.080
 but it results from that priest 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.340
 Good people, now, just try it on. 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:07.030
 to know if you're good tell your father that you like 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.030
 of the same 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.110
 where the video 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:20.270
 the event to 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.270
 Now I'm going to get all the americans. 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.809
 during 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.440
 people you want can signal with 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.910
 chopped chives or alone or else 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.950
 beat along with the recipe itself 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.900
 in that first step of the common garlic 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.900
 Curd was expensive 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.610
 We still have some left over. 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:26.640
 equivalent to 92 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:26.640
 can invest the daily paper there 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.240
 I hope you liked me.
