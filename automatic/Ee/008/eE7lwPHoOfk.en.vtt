I<00:01:22.380> wanna<00:01:23.380> put<00:01:24.100> on<00:01:24.400> I<00:01:24.640> guess<00:01:24.850> my<00:01:24.880> Master's<00:01:25.450> had

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
I wanna put on I guess my Master's had

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.770

40 and say that and since none of this
would<00:01:28.960> be<00:01:28.990> possible<00:01:29.080> we<00:01:29.800> didn't<00:01:30.040> have<00:01:30.190> a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
would be possible we didn't have a

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.310 
would be possible we didn't have a
culture<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:31.120> nourished<00:01:31.510> in<00:01:31.630> celebrating

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
and I'm still very much aware that their

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.780 
and I'm still very much aware that their
children<00:01:35.590> return<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.130> car<00:01:36.370> mine<00:01:36.610> already

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880
