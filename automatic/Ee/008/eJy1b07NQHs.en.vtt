00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 well I can see where we are loading 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.960
 two vehicles that look alike but 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.960
 they are not because I have here 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.740
 It is a peugeot partner and this one that I have 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.590
 here thanks sector 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.090
 it is a citroën berlingo two vehicles 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.630
 that are born practically with the same 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.950
 function try to be as utilitarian 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.480
 possible but in these versions that 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.980
 we have here are not utilitarian are the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.720
 versions for passenger transport 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.700
 but as you will see we arrived at the market 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.559
 central and we check that I really have 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.480
 been in for both things that's the 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.190
 story of the concept of these two 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.699
 vehicles that we are going to study today in 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.699
 c5n 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.870
 the reality is that the origins of this 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.270
 segment go back decades ago 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 and I think the most remembered was the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.070
 citroën we all remember the 12 by and its 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.990
 version of the Dalian that was the one 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.360
 it happened to 12 v had a version 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.700
 utilitarian call here diana with him the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.200
 objective not only to bring people 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.780
 but also that it serves for a 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 urban freight transport after wine 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 the villa and the villa also had its 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.500
 let's say van version called 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.630
 ekin after that 15 arrived this one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 berlingo but we could say that it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.759
 goes back to the origins because of a 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.369
 vehicle that was practically 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.729
 utility was passed to a category a 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.619
 segment that they called multispace 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.320
 Lu2 page is no longer known why 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.840
 segmentation 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 we could say there are infinite games of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.360
 name this segment in short what 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.190
 What we have here is a vehicle with a 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.320
 segment platform b for its 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.690
 dimensions that has the possibility of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.130
 carry 800 kilos of cargo or else in this 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.280
 version in the case of berlingo 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.590
 multispace can take 5 people 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.830
 really very very comfortable in the case of 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.400
 partner what we have here is the version 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.500
 of tc of the Patagonian who has others 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.810
 finishing details how to make these 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.520
 carries objects on top and 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.070
 we have some defenses for the headlights 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.590
 both front and rear that is the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.020
 Transformed concept of the old 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.570
 van what happened is that it was ripped 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.250
 of a vehicle was passed to the van and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.290
 today what we have is a van that 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.239
 is becoming more of a vehicle 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.700
 of passengers in short what are 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.560
 trying brands is to satisfy the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.230
 as many possible needs 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.670
 with just one vehicle and for that you're 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.670
 two versions are bright
