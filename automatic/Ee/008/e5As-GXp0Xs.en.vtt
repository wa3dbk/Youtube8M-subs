and what is interesting that I didn't

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.030 
and what is interesting that I didn't
even<00:04:28.140> think<00:04:28.260> about<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.920> actually

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
even think about this you actually

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
that in the only thing I wish is we

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.480 
that in the only thing I wish is we
could<00:04:40.380> actually<00:04:40.620> see<00:04:41.010> what<00:04:41.040> these<00:04:41.280> guys<00:04:41.430> are

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
could actually see what these guys are

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.550 
could actually see what these guys are
truly<00:04:41.880> capable<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.630> seeing<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:42.960> how<00:04:43.050> they<00:04:43.170> move

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
truly capable of seeing is how they move

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.380 
truly capable of seeing is how they move
the<00:04:43.710> very<00:04:43.920> first<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.520> their<00:04:44.640> village<00:04:45.000> they

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
the very first of their village they

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.120 
the very first of their village they
gotta<00:04:45.570> be<00:04:45.750> some<00:04:45.930> pretty<00:04:46.140> badass<00:04:46.440> characters

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
gotta be some pretty badass characters

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.800 
gotta be some pretty badass characters
so<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.490> wish<00:04:48.030> they<00:04:48.150> could<00:04:48.300> do<00:04:48.390> more<00:04:48.420> with<00:04:48.690> them

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
so I wish they could do more with them

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.080 
so I wish they could do more with them
maybe<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.230> future<00:04:49.530> but<00:04:50.400> still<00:04:50.670> all<00:04:50.970> the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
maybe in the future but still all the

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.610 
maybe in the future but still all the
big<00:04:51.240> action<00:04:51.450> panels<00:04:51.840> are<00:04:51.960> pretty<00:04:52.110> good<00:04:52.260> you

big action panels are pretty good you
know<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.340> whole<00:04:53.520> thing<00:04:53.760> was<00:04:53.970> Susanoo<00:04:54.480> yeah<00:04:55.020> it

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.440 
know the whole thing was Susanoo yeah it
was<00:04:55.290> only<00:04:55.350> one<00:04:55.650> yeah<00:04:58.430> yeah<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.940> know<00:05:00.060> this<00:05:00.300> new

sonic thing you know in the explanation
behind<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.210> guess<00:05:03.360> it's<00:05:03.540> just<00:05:03.600> an<00:05:03.840> excuse

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
behind it I guess it's just an excuse

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.770 
behind it I guess it's just an excuse
for<00:05:04.410> him<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.740> be<00:05:04.860> able<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.130> attack<00:05:05.400> Obito<00:05:05.850> works

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
for him to be able to attack Obito works

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.230 
for him to be able to attack Obito works
but<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.140> works<00:05:07.370> it's<00:05:08.370> not<00:05:08.430> like<00:05:08.760> I'm<00:05:08.940> not<00:05:09.090> like
