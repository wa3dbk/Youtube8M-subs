already<00:02:01.270> stripped<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:01.750> whatnot<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:02.350> got

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
already stripped it and whatnot I got

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.270 
already stripped it and whatnot I got
the<00:02:03.190> other<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:03.340> bare<00:02:03.640> as<00:02:03.790> well<00:02:04.000> now<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.840> is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the other one bare as well now this is

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.620 
the other one bare as well now this is
this<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.430> probably<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.880> most<00:02:06.940> stressful<00:02:07.120> for

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
this is probably the most stressful for

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.240 
this is probably the most stressful for
at<00:02:07.720> least<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:07.960> was<00:02:08.080> for<00:02:08.110> me<00:02:08.289> you're<00:02:08.920> looking<00:02:09.160> at

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.160 
at least it was for me you're looking at
this<00:02:09.610> what<00:02:10.479> you're<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.750> do<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.080> you're

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
going to bend that back to where it's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.699 
going to bend that back to where it's
almost<00:02:15.640> folded<00:02:15.850> on<00:02:16.090> top<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.480> each<00:02:16.600> other<00:02:16.750> all<00:02:18.390> I

almost folded on top of each other all I

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.480 
almost folded on top of each other all I
know<00:02:20.709> if<00:02:20.860> you're<00:02:20.950> going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.130> be<00:02:21.190> able<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.370> see

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
of needle nose pliers and Bend this I'm

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.000 
of needle nose pliers and Bend this I'm
just<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.630> do<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:31.959> hang<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:37.110> down<00:02:38.110> like

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
just going to do this hang on down like

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.120 
just going to do this hang on down like
this<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.190> then<00:02:42.760> you'll<00:02:43.060> hook<00:02:44.130> on

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
this and that and then you'll hook on

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.270 
this and that and then you'll hook on
the<00:02:45.340> long<00:02:45.489> goons<00:02:45.760> remember<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:47.590> was<00:02:47.800> basically

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the long goons remember it was basically

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.860 
the long goons remember it was basically
this<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> go<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.180> there<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.390> this

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
this is going to go in there like this

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.370 
this is going to go in there like this
and<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.590> going<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.800> go<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.070> ground

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
and then this is going to go to a ground

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.840 
and then this is going to go to a ground
plugged<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.500> there<00:02:53.650> like<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.580> let's<00:02:54.730> do

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
plugged in there like this so let's do

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.960 
plugged in there like this so let's do
that

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.060 

okay<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:01.320> thing<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.590> get<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.860> back<00:03:03.040> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
okay now a thing to get this back and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.259 
okay now a thing to get this back and
you<00:03:03.250> might<00:03:03.430> have<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.640> get<00:03:03.760> like<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.970> pair<00:03:04.239> of

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
you might have to get like a pair of

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.750 
you might have to get like a pair of
razor<00:03:05.019> blade<00:03:05.290> or<00:03:05.320> something<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.760> cut<00:03:08.760> see

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
razor blade or something and cut see

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.840 
razor blade or something and cut see
that<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.260> question<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.739> recording<00:03:15.220> this

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.740 

that's<00:03:18.850> just<00:03:19.060> going<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.239> have<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.360> suffice<00:03:19.570> for

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that's just going to have to suffice for

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.199 
that's just going to have to suffice for
right<00:03:20.049> now<00:03:20.430> I'm<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.670> see<00:03:21.820> if<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.060> will

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
right now I'm going to see if this will

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.810 
right now I'm going to see if this will
plug<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.799> won't<00:03:24.130> we<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.580> do<00:03:24.640> some

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
plug in it won't we have to do some

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.090 
plug in it won't we have to do some
surgery<00:03:26.700> okay<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.120> what<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.360> did<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.920> get<00:03:30.040> that

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
surgery okay so what I did to get that

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.789 
surgery okay so what I did to get that
in<00:03:30.400> there<00:03:30.640> it's<00:03:31.360> not<00:03:31.510> very<00:03:31.780> clear<00:03:32.170> but<00:03:32.320> uh

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
in there it's not very clear but uh

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.770 
in there it's not very clear but uh
there's<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.850> piece<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.000> plastic<00:03:34.600> you'll

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
there's a piece of plastic you'll

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.090 
there's a piece of plastic you'll
probably<00:03:34.989> see<00:03:35.260> if<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.560> actually<00:03:35.830> choose<00:03:35.980> to

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
probably see if you actually choose to

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.890 
probably see if you actually choose to
do<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.370> up<00:03:36.880> there<00:03:37.269> that's<00:03:37.420> kind<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
do this up there that's kind of in the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.350 
do this up there that's kind of in the
way<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.610> what<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.640> did<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:40.329> of

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
way and what I did is I just kind of

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.729 
way and what I did is I just kind of
scraped<00:03:40.660> off<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.870> little<00:03:41.110> bit<00:03:41.320> with<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.500> knife

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
scraped off a little bit with a knife

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.030 
scraped off a little bit with a knife
and<00:03:43.110> basically<00:03:44.110> managed<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.590> get<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.950> where

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
and basically managed to get it to where

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.490 
and basically managed to get it to where
that<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.400> fit<00:03:45.760> back<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.150> there<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:46.510> now<00:03:47.079> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
that will fit back in there and now the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.120 
that will fit back in there and now the
last<00:03:47.709> part<00:03:48.070> is<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:49.120> define<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.540> ground<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
last part is you define the ground the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.900 
last part is you define the ground the
other<00:03:51.160> end<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.640> wire<00:03:51.820> there<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:53.910> can

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
other end of the wire there is a I can

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.559 
other end of the wire there is a I can
be<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:56.350> hell<00:03:56.560> out<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.769> my<00:03:56.980> truck

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
ground it anyway guys that let's see how

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.999 
ground it anyway guys that let's see how
I<00:04:17.739> finally<00:04:18.250> that's<00:04:18.850> where<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.680> plug<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:20.859> in

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
I finally that's where I plug that in

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.820 
I finally that's where I plug that in
whatever<00:04:21.160> Nick<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:23.490> move<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.729> thing<00:04:24.970> back

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
whatever Nick you move this thing back

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.650 
whatever Nick you move this thing back
right<00:04:26.830> here<00:04:27.539> there's<00:04:30.000> any<00:04:31.000> inkling<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:31.449> hard

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
right here there's any inkling it hard

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.860 
right here there's any inkling it hard
but<00:04:32.259> uh<00:04:32.610> that's<00:04:33.610> where<00:04:33.849> that<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.330> clip<00:04:34.690> right

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
but uh that's where that that clip right

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.580 
but uh that's where that that clip right
there<00:04:36.030> that's<00:04:37.030> where<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.419> would<00:04:37.690> plug<00:04:38.380> into

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
there that's where that would plug into

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.430 
there that's where that would plug into
and<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:40.360> wrap<00:04:40.539> that<00:04:40.750> wire<00:04:40.930> around<00:04:40.960> there<00:04:41.410> a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
and just wrap that wire around there a

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.230 
and just wrap that wire around there a
few<00:04:41.680> times<00:04:41.919> it's<00:04:42.160> probably<00:04:42.820> going<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.060> come

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
few times it's probably going to come

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.159 
few times it's probably going to come
loose<00:04:43.419> but<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:44.110> when<00:04:44.259> you<00:04:45.720> push<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.750> back

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
loose but then when you push that back

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.210 
loose but then when you push that back
up<00:04:47.349> in<00:04:47.530> there<00:04:47.680> whatever<00:04:48.070> like<00:04:48.750> like<00:04:49.750> that<00:04:50.220> it

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
up in there whatever like like that it

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.879 
up in there whatever like like that it
actually<00:04:51.400> holds<00:04:51.639> in<00:04:51.940> really<00:04:52.180> well<00:04:52.330> cos<00:04:52.860> cuz<00:04:53.860> uh

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
actually holds in really well cos cuz uh

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.219 
actually holds in really well cos cuz uh
the<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.820> plastic<00:04:55.270> clip<00:04:55.509> kind<00:04:55.690> of<00:04:55.750> forces<00:04:56.139> it

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
the the plastic clip kind of forces it

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.620 
the the plastic clip kind of forces it
up<00:04:56.289> against<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.650> metal<00:04:57.150> it'll<00:04:58.150> probably<00:04:58.360> fall

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
up against the metal it'll probably fall

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.909 
up against the metal it'll probably fall
off<00:04:58.660> one<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:58.990> these<00:04:59.110> days<00:04:59.169> and<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.530> won't<00:04:59.710> really

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
opposite of us and way as they say um

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.989 
opposite of us and way as they say um
one<00:06:02.379> thing<00:06:02.409> you're<00:06:03.249> gonna<00:06:03.369> want<00:06:03.549> to<00:06:03.610> do<00:06:03.729> is
