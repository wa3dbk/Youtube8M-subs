00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
I started thinking about that grade five
12<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.240> lot<00:01:24.390> more<00:01:26.030> even<00:01:27.030> though<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.149> have<00:01:28.080> red

12 a lot more even though I have red
pointed<00:01:28.920> harder<00:01:29.130> than<00:01:29.250> five<00:01:29.430> twelve<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.509> just

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
pointed harder than five twelve I just

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.170 
pointed harder than five twelve I just
kept<00:01:31.410> coming<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.520> number<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
kept coming back to that that number it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.480 
kept coming back to that that number it
stayed<00:01:33.660> in<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.810> mind<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:35.009> shortly<00:01:35.250> after

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
