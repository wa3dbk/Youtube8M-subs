00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.110 
there's your output there it is RCA for
both<00:04:02.150> booth<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.780> master<00:04:03.549> now<00:04:04.549> here's<00:04:04.909> your

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
both booth and master now here's your

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.119 
both booth and master now here's your
DBS<00:04:05.569> system<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:06.470> actually<00:04:06.829> kind<00:04:07.069> of

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
DBS system so this is actually kind of

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.369 
DBS system so this is actually kind of
cool<00:04:07.340> here<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.329> way<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.629> works<00:04:08.989> is<00:04:09.290> you

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
cool here and the way this works is you

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.170 
cool here and the way this works is you
would<00:04:09.890> instead<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.640> like<00:04:10.819> if<00:04:10.940> you're<00:04:11.030> using

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
would instead it like if you're using

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.610 
would instead it like if you're using
something<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:11.599> sarado<00:04:12.019> tractor<00:04:12.560> or

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
something like sarado tractor or

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.380 
something like sarado tractor or
something<00:04:12.860> like<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.760> would<00:04:13.970> put<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
something like that you would put the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.420 
something like that you would put the
phone<00:04:14.989> on<00:04:15.019> straight<00:04:15.440> from<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.739> turntables

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
phone on straight from the turntables

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.550 
phone on straight from the turntables
straight<00:04:17.120> into<00:04:17.329> your<00:04:17.449> phone<00:04:17.750> oh<00:04:17.930> in<00:04:18.199> that's

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
straight into your phone oh in that's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.259 
straight into your phone oh in that's
where<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:18.859> would<00:04:18.979> put<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:19.310> here<00:04:19.639> then<00:04:20.090> the

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
where you would put it here then the

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.689 
where you would put it here then the
output<00:04:20.840> from<00:04:21.229> your<00:04:21.289> Serato<00:04:21.739> box<00:04:22.070> would<00:04:22.460> go<00:04:22.639> to

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
output from your Serato box would go to

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.540 
output from your Serato box would go to
the<00:04:23.030> send<00:04:23.479> and<00:04:23.810> then<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.620> return<00:04:24.979> would<00:04:25.310> go<00:04:25.490> to

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
the send and then the return would go to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.210 
the send and then the return would go to
the<00:04:25.669> input<00:04:26.120> on<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.449> cerrado<00:04:26.750> box<00:04:27.139> and<00:04:27.440> pretty

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
the input on the cerrado box and pretty

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.950 
the input on the cerrado box and pretty
much<00:04:28.370> what<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.639> allows<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.180> do<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.600> just

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
much what that allows you to do is just

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.550 
much what that allows you to do is just
toggle<00:04:30.500> between<00:04:31.240> phono<00:04:32.240> timecode<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.410> know

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
toggle between phono timecode you know

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.990 
toggle between phono timecode you know
so<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.800> don't<00:04:33.889> have<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.310> switch<00:04:34.760> anything

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
so you don't have to switch anything

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.610 
so you don't have to switch anything
around<00:04:35.479> and<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:35.750> could<00:04:35.900> use<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.139> through<00:04:36.350> on

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
around and you could use the through on

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.100 
around and you could use the through on
Cerato<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.370> use<00:04:37.760> regular<00:04:38.180> records<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:38.960> that's

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
Cerato and use regular records so that's

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.020 
Cerato and use regular records so that's
actually<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.680> really<00:04:39.889> neat<00:04:40.160> feature<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:40.760> so

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
actually a really neat feature there so

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.270 
actually a really neat feature there so
it<00:04:41.180> doesn't<00:04:41.360> disrupt<00:04:41.840> playing<00:04:42.530> it's<00:04:42.830> um<00:04:43.070> you
