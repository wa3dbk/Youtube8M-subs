00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
what position to do in my career I'm

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.220 
what position to do in my career I'm
kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.280> stuck<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> crew

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
kind of stuck because if there is a crew

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.840 
kind of stuck because if there is a crew
like<00:00:37.410> mode<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.890> next-gen<00:00:38.309> which<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.610> probably

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
like mode on next-gen which I probably

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.299 
like mode on next-gen which I probably
think<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.980> there's<00:00:40.980> only<00:00:41.070> two

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
think there is there's only two

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.500 
think there is there's only two
positions<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.820> i<00:00:41.879> would<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.329> play

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
positions that i would like to play

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.350 
positions that i would like to play
that's<00:00:43.110> either<00:00:43.410> point<00:00:43.860> guard<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.850> run<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> team

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that's either point guard to run a team

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
that's either point guard to run a team
because<00:00:45.690> i'm<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.079> good<00:00:46.230> at<00:00:46.260> doing<00:00:46.559> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
because i'm really good at doing that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.240 
because i'm really good at doing that
especially<00:00:46.920> playing<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> crew<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.230> a

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
especially playing with a crew or a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.439 
especially playing with a crew or a
small<00:00:50.250> forward<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> reason<00:00:51.180> why<00:00:51.270> i<00:00:51.300> say

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
small forward and the reason why i say

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.840 
small forward and the reason why i say
smart<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.980> i'll<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
smart for it is because i'll do it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.939 
smart for it is because i'll do it
athletic<00:00:54.360> version<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> he'll<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.739> able<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
athletic version and he'll be able to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
athletic version and he'll be able to
get<00:00:56.070> rebounds<00:00:56.460> make<00:00:57.360> big<00:00:57.690> stops<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.320> i<00:00:58.469> was

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
get rebounds make big stops like i was

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
get rebounds make big stops like i was
playing<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.280> forgot<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.480> care<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.870> man

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
playing on I forgot what to care was man

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
playing on I forgot what to care was man
but<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> had<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> small<00:01:01.859> forward<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
but I had a small forward and I was just

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.329 
but I had a small forward and I was just
dominating<00:01:03.629> everybody<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.260> defense<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
dominating everybody on defense so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
dominating everybody on defense so
that's<00:01:05.549> why<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:06.119> want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> small
