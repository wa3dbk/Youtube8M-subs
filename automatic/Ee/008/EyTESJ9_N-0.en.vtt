heart rate monitor and I've talked about

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.470 
heart rate monitor and I've talked about
this<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.039> couple<00:01:02.070> fit<00:01:02.609> tips<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.090> q<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.359> A's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
this in a couple fit tips and q and A's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.170 
this in a couple fit tips and q and A's
before<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.979> heart<00:01:05.580> rate<00:01:05.700> monitor<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
before I think a heart rate monitor is a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
before I think a heart rate monitor is a
great<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> determine<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.070> you're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
great way for you to determine if you're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.940 
great way for you to determine if you're
working<00:01:08.460> hard<00:01:08.760> enough<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.210> only<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> during

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
working hard enough I only use it during

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.670 
working hard enough I only use it during
cardio<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:11.880> use<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.180> very<00:01:13.020> often<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
cardio I don't use it very often when I

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
cardio I don't use it very often when I
do<00:01:13.799> weight<00:01:14.070> training<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:17.490> does<00:01:17.939> come<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
do weight training it does come with a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.499 
do weight training it does come with a
chest<00:01:18.869> strap<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:20.250> watch<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
chest strap and a watch so you have to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.120 
chest strap and a watch so you have to
wear<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> chest<00:01:22.020> strap<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.920> goes

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
wear the chest strap and it goes

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.820 
wear the chest strap and it goes
underneath<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:24.030> sports<00:01:24.420> bra<00:01:24.689> against<00:01:25.680> your

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
underneath your sports bra against your

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
underneath your sports bra against your
skin<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.060> want<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> little

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
skin and if you want it just a little

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
skin and if you want it just a little
bit<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.590> helps<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> conductivity<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
bit it helps with the conductivity of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.460 
bit it helps with the conductivity of
the<00:01:30.530> actual<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:33.000> weird<00:01:33.240> link<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.290> will

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the actual on the weird link and it will

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.580 
the actual on the weird link and it will
read<00:01:34.770> easier<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.540> watch<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
read easier on the watch but if you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.050 
read easier on the watch but if you
implement<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:38.220> weight<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:39.030> height

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
implement your weight and your height

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.130 
implement your weight and your height
and<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.780> gender<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.610> your<00:01:41.610> goal<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.630> will

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and your gender and your goal it will

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.370 
and your gender and your goal it will
determine<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:44.460> range<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.420> should<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.750> at<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
determine what range you should be at to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.999 
determine what range you should be at to
reach<00:01:46.740> your<00:01:47.610> desired<00:01:47.880> goal<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:49.829> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
reach your desired goal so I use this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.749 
reach your desired goal so I use this
when<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.610> cardio<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> polar

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
when I do cardio and this is a polar

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
when I do cardio and this is a polar
heart<00:01:54.149> monitor<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.229> these<00:01:55.380> at

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
heart monitor and you can get these at

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.440 
heart monitor and you can get these at
any<00:01:55.770> sporting<00:01:56.729> goods<00:01:56.880> store<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.479> polar<00:01:58.200> -

so<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> number

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
so this is a in the number

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.219 
so this is a in the number
this<00:02:03.950> one<00:02:04.220> is<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:07.190> know<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.850> ft<00:02:08.570> 40

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
this one is you know this is a ft 40

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.860 
this one is you know this is a ft 40
watch<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.160> they<00:02:10.310> all<00:02:10.490> have<00:02:10.870> different

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
watch so they all have different

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.540 
watch so they all have different
capabilities<00:02:12.250> obviously<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> more

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
capabilities obviously the more

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.210 
capabilities obviously the more
expensive<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.660> more<00:02:14.870> options<00:02:15.350> are<00:02:15.650> available

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
those seem to be okay but they just

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.230 
those seem to be okay but they just
don't<00:02:45.980> go<00:02:46.130> with<00:02:46.250> deep<00:02:46.430> enough<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:46.970> feel<00:02:47.209> like

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
don't go with deep enough so I feel like

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.850 
don't go with deep enough so I feel like
when<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> run<00:02:47.840> or<00:02:48.020> jump<00:02:48.230> they're<00:02:48.470> gonna<00:02:48.620> fall
