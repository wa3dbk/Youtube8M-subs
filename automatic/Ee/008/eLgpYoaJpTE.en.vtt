00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
will not stick to normal skin very

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.640 
will not stick to normal skin very
easily<00:04:13.329> it'll<00:04:14.329> kind<00:04:14.600> of<00:04:14.690> just<00:04:14.900> peel<00:04:15.139> off<00:04:15.440> er

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
easily it'll kind of just peel off er

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.699 
easily it'll kind of just peel off er
now<00:04:16.639> this<00:04:16.789> one<00:04:16.970> takes<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.419> while<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.660> set<00:04:18.260> up<00:04:18.410> but

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
now this one takes a while to set up but

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.259 
now this one takes a while to set up but
you<00:04:19.070> can<00:04:19.250> speed<00:04:19.519> up<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.700> process

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
you can speed up the process

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.150 
you can speed up the process
by<00:04:20.780> taking<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:21.260> brush<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.680> has<00:04:21.859> kind<00:04:22.130> of

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
by taking a brush that has kind of

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.089 
by taking a brush that has kind of
around<00:04:22.490> end<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.389> then<00:04:23.950> rolling<00:04:24.950> it

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
around end to it and then rolling it

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.070 
around end to it and then rolling it
across<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:26.210> now<00:04:26.360> we're<00:04:26.479> going<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.630> take<00:04:26.810> scar

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
across so now we're going to take scar

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.930 
across so now we're going to take scar
wax<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.770> also<00:04:27.950> Ben<00:04:28.340> Nye

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.960 
open and get some reason so now that
it's<00:04:44.530> had<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.680> chance<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.130> catch<00:04:45.280> sit<00:04:45.700> we're

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970

it's had a chance to catch sit we're
gonna<00:04:46.060> go<00:04:46.210> ahead<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.420> just<00:04:46.600> move<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:46.930> out<00:04:46.990> a

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
gonna go ahead and just move it out a

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.170 
gonna go ahead and just move it out a
little<00:04:47.230> bit<00:04:47.440> more<00:04:47.710> as<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.550> move<00:04:48.760> your<00:04:48.790> fence

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
little bit more as you move your fence

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.820 
little bit more as you move your fence
that<00:04:49.360> will<00:04:49.510> make<00:04:49.720> natural<00:04:50.020> wrinkles<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:50.710> this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
that will make natural wrinkles in this

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.260 
that will make natural wrinkles in this
which<00:04:51.160> is<00:04:51.190> great<00:04:51.520> because<00:04:51.910> then<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.240> looks

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
which is great because then it looks

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.500 
which is great because then it looks
like<00:04:52.570> it's<00:04:52.810> part<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.140> your<00:04:53.290> skin<00:04:53.820> but<00:04:54.820> I'm<00:04:55.390> just

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
gonna go ahead and smooth it out so it's

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.850 
gonna go ahead and smooth it out so it's
easier<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.160> kind<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:57.370> sculpt<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.870> you<00:04:59.560> can<00:04:59.740> use

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
easier to kind of sculpt so you can use

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.320
