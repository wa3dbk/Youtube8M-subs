00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.260 
the school expresso from an expresso
machine<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:23.010> pattern<00:04:23.430> is<00:04:23.550> going<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.880> be<00:04:23.970> nice

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
machine the pattern is going to be nice

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.310 
machine the pattern is going to be nice
as<00:04:24.660> well

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
as well

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.070 
as well
I've<00:04:26.190> also<00:04:26.550> tried<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:27.000> LEDs<00:04:27.390> break<00:04:27.690> apart

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
I've also tried the LEDs break apart

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.250 
I've also tried the LEDs break apart
which<00:04:28.980> creates<00:04:29.460> more<00:04:29.520> crema<00:04:29.970> but<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.840> result

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
which creates more crema but the result

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:50.040 
which creates more crema but the result
isn't<00:04:31.560> any<00:04:31.860> better<00:04:32.070> than<00:04:32.520> this
