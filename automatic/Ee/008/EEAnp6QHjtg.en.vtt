 Tunnel development and develop 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.330
 also hike with this trail 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.080
 But I want to introduce myself before I start my name is Claus Kleber 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.630
 I am an employee 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.490
 this requires the Office for Bodensekmalpflege in the Rhineland and yet 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.700
 in charge of engineering historical monuments so roads bridges and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.190
 Tunnel water pipes 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.790
 and that's why 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.980
 this Varberg 2 0 break also in my field of work before we were in vitro 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.600
 Fortresses psychic of the high Middle Ages in the Rhineland, especially in lowlands 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.090
 the water had been built, the moths were created by it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.700
 Graben has dug up circle Kleve from Guben has the soil inside 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.470
 This has caused a hype a moth has sprung up and was on it 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.560
 built a castle and here we see such a remnant of a moth 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.920
 Once upon a time in the thirteenth century a castle stood in the 17th century 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.950
 Century have been removed and since then you only see this vortex 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.489
 this is left over from a once proud Rhenish castle 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.579

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.579
