 If you have just arrived in Dublin, please come to NED Training Centre for the first time to ask your agent what you don't understand. 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.200
 This video will tell you how you should take the first step in Ireland. 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 The agent will solve all your questions. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 During the conversation, you will receive a letter asking you to apply for the PPS Number. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Please inform your agent about your local address at this time. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.000
 In about 5 days, bank related letters will be sent to the address you provided. 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.500
 Please do not open this letter. We will talk later. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 After the conversation, your agent will arrange your placement test in order to judge your English level. 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.200

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.900

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.500
 This is very simple, the PPS department is near the NED Training Centre. 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.000
 When applying for the PPS Number, remember to bring your passport and the PPS letter provided by the agent. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.900
 PPS is your identification message. 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 When you have received your PPS Number, the next step is to apply for a bank account. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.300
 Do you remember the letters that we told you not to open? 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.900
 You must bring this letter, your registration letter, and your passport to apply for a bank account. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 Your bank card and password will be mailed to your home in about 5 to 10 days. 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 Remember to deposit your deposit after you have received your password and bank card. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.000

 When you receive your bank statement, please bring your passport, registration letter, bank statement and PPS Number to GNIB. 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.800
 European students do not need to apply for GNIB. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.700
