00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
a light in the cave because there's a

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:56.039 
a light in the cave because there's a
hole<00:01:49.259> see

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.380 

Oh<00:01:56.079> happy<00:01:58.829> beautiful

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.620 

that<00:02:03.020> part's<00:02:03.260> pretty<00:02:03.320> dull<00:02:04.300> but<00:02:05.300> there's<00:02:05.479> your

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that part's pretty dull but there's your

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.800 
that part's pretty dull but there's your
feet<00:02:05.840> on<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:05.990> tree<00:02:06.260> that's<00:02:06.650> horrible

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
feet on the tree that's horrible

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.960 
feet on the tree that's horrible
it's<00:02:08.810> horrible<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:09.289> people<00:02:09.530> do

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.280 

but<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.840> very<00:02:16.080> useful<00:02:17.750> if<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> had<00:02:19.080> remained

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
but it is very useful if it had remained

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.850 
but it is very useful if it had remained
untouched

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.320

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
let's not go I guess that's the tree

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.540 
let's not go I guess that's the tree
split<00:02:50.900> Oh<00:02:53.470> probably<00:02:54.470> probably<00:02:55.010> probably<00:02:55.190> got

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
split Oh probably probably probably got

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.440 
split Oh probably probably probably got
hit<00:02:55.730> by<00:02:55.880> lightning<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:57.970> really<00:02:58.970> bad<00:02:59.180> storm

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
hit by lightning of it really bad storm

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.180 
hit by lightning of it really bad storm
or<00:02:59.690> something<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.500> there's<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.770> trailer<00:03:01.160> that

or something and there's a trailer that

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.580 
or something and there's a trailer that
way<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:01.910> think<00:03:02.570> that's<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> TRO<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.260> took<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.560> to

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
way I think that's the TRO we took it to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.360 
way I think that's the TRO we took it to
get<00:03:03.770> up<00:03:03.890> there

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
