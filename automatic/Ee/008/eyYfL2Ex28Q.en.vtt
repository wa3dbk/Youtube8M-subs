00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.990
 all right 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.990
 on the shore 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.779
 max and emme 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.779
 I feel 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.350
 no no 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.710
 well this video I did because the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.870
 true a friend asked me to do so 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.600
 how good is very practical and in addition to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.200
 that all of you want this is to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.200
 what I mean 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.460
 that's how I have it working like this and in my 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 ipod touch 4g 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.500
 and then I will show you how I did 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.140
 this 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.000
 first step we have to come to Syria 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.270
 remember that this has to be a 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.659
 jailbreak untethered because or if not 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.659
 will be highlighted in the manzanita of 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.200
 apple after a while to learn again 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.200
 device 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.490
 let's go for this we have to add a 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 source 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.780
 then we come here and it's fair 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.780
 is here 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.720
 rest seaport dot hereu if you do not know 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.900
 how to add is easy to edit add 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 and this is going to come out then the only thing 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.560
 what they do is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.560
 a repo 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.640
 point 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.760
 siri ports 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.970
 ry points give you to add source 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.030
 ready now after adding 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.030
 this source we are going to come and look 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.350
 Here we will write 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.930
 Syrian port 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:30.769
 now 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:30.769
 if they have a jailbreak of that 5.0 5.0.1 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.630
 install this here only from the psir and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.490
 ports 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:44.900
 now they have jailbreak of 5.1 and 5.1.1 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:48.310
 must install the original siri port 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.260
 then they come here and click on 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.850
 install I have to modify because I already 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.210
 I have installed 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.040
 wait for it to settle and now they have 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.900
 that crush the reset button 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.900
 device that appears 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.600
 ready after learning 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.390
 our device we go to settings 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.860
 and we went down everything and as we see there is no 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.440
 no space because it is installed 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.720
 like it was same from apple now 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.790
 follow him to where we have to go in 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.150
 safari 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.150
 is 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.890
 if you report 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:41.610
 point r slash 1 point is rt 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.280
 and they put in going 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.380
 then it will come out as well as that 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.240
 canceled quietly 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.820
 now they must install that 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.810
 quiet does not do anything is reliable as 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.310
 come there 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.990
 and when they install him they must come 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.800
 here 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.800
 and settings 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.190
 and they will have here yes 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.650
 they must turn it on and check that all this 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.549
 be as you want me to be 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.750
 now they're going to crush the button and it's going to 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.640
 leave as if it is not available 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.640
 but that will be activated as 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.270
 12 hours 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.520
 then they should keep trying and 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.629
 I will prove that my city works in my 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.629
 ipod touch 4g 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.339

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.339

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:59.239

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.069
 subscribe if you liked it 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.309
 remember that any package of cydia 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:13.229
 which serves with spike or spider serves with 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:16.139
 siri port this works 100% and 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.770
 I will prove that he installs them until 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.770
 dictator 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.350
