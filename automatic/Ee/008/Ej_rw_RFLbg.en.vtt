00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.629
 you can think since nothing is missing for 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.190
 the world that is missing less and less 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.650
 be few tests 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.170
 very little time where it happens very fast 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.420
 because we are playing 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.160
 everything important in the championship so 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.080
 let's see what we 're doing 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.390
 in what each one in his pen like this 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.970
 that we have just come do not start 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.760
 play important answers to define 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.470
 tournaments are a cup final and all 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.590
 at the end in champions 2 but sports 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.230
 all outside we are fighting a league not 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 It gives you time to get to think but 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.280
 we know that it is as I said it receives very 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.280
 close and that maybe it's there 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.129
 There is no more javier told me something 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.079
 very interesting as that to the generation 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.320
 of you that is a generation 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.320
 bright they still want to conquer 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.730
 that missing world said that I did not 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.019
 they have to take with an obsession because 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.880
 that ends up being dangerous and 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.159
 counterproductive is a little bit so do not 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.070
 you have to obsess that you have to go as 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.230
 step by step that we know we have clear 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.480
 that 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.950
 there are many guys who have already gone through 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.610
 a global what I did know what 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.610
 they played worldwide 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.300
 we are on the sidelines of 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.010
 of the illusion that people have with 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.360
 this selection we know that we have a 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.000
 good team that we have many 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.520
 possibilities but that the world cup is 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.110
 difficult and having to give a little 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.600
 because in a world cup you can go through everything 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.320
 what can be said about how a game is played 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.800
 world me 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.700
 as I just said a world cup can happen 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.700
 everything can be 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.560
 game if you can end up losing 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.780
 at the precise moment and I think that 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.689
 you have to be lucky to be 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.280
 champion that is said because because everything 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.979
 the team that came out champion in some 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.439
 moment they were watching the world cup on 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.509
 last world cup spain beats paraguay 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.360
 attacking at 6 a penalty after both 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.040
 hand in hand with robben 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.780
 obviously it was the best selection of 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 world 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.260
 all great but also had the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.600
 luck that you have to have 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.300
 xavi iniesta always tell me that I read no 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.170
 world standard they tell you something too 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.690
 that does not value that on the one hand 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.840
 also for the friendship we have 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.910
 and they have a world cup they want me 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.970
 that I can we argentina 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.750
 we can win we can win a world cup 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.760
 more than once they told me for now 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.630
 half that long ago that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.310
 we are together 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.310
 and hopefully I can be 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.380
 awesome agreement with usa you me 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.820
 you said do not ask me why but I 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.750
 I know God is going to give me a world cup 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.750
 keep thinking 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.540
 a dream thinking scale 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.730
 I hope it happens 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.650
 as an exerciser we are preparing for 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.069
 to walk in the best way is already 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.459
 little bit to the test and I think the group 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.430
 is at a moment just to be able to 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.469
 do important things you told me is the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.920
 word group and several of your classmates 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.750
 they speak of that word that is a group to 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.360
 see how a group is made up so that 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.420
 be good 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.570
 I think they count in the union in 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.580
 the relationships that exist between us in 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.530
 the knowledge that we have one with the 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.830
 another one a long time ago that the group that 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.250
 is today that is known about many guys 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.750
 many of us who have already played together since 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.580
 sub-20 but to see gave voice in what 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.770
 palpa that for example one has to 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.660
 stay out and have a good face in that 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.940
 they get together to drink mate to chat about the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.340
 life in which friendship is beyond 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.990
 what happens on the court all that there 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.930
 friendship because like I said just do 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.450
 long time we know each other 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.129
 everyone knows what their role is 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.900
 within the selection 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.440
 it does not matter if it is inside or outside the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.540
 eleven holder 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.420
 I did not kill him the talk continuously is a 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.489
 group where you have got a lot you think 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.470
 like that if it's not now it's not anymore 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.000
 this because this voice and because there is a 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.650
 group of colleagues who are in a 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.200
 Barbarian moment to play in teams 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.550
 important and that help you in you 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.400
 feel a little bit so if it's not in 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.060
 Brazil is becoming more complicated 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.150
 I do not know the truth that I do not know also I think 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.550
 that there was always 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.890
 select very good that your argentina 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.290
 that came to a world cup with a lot of 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.100
 expectation with great enthusiasm for the 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.530
 players that he had and it did not go well 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.970
 I hope it's not the case but it's 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.610
 true that we all arrived as and that 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.830
 just at a moment in a just moment 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.450
 both in the group and individually 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.450
 touristy each one of us
