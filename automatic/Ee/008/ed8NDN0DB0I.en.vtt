00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.190 
again sometime soon and I'll just talk
about<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.560> game<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> little<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.250> believe

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
about the game a little bit I believe

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.870 
about the game a little bit I believe
I'm<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> only<00:01:37.470> commander<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.400> game<00:01:38.610> I'm

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I'm the only commander of this game I'm

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
I'm the only commander of this game I'm
rolling<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> commander<00:01:39.659> Megatron<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
rolling with the commander Megatron and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.380 
rolling with the commander Megatron and
I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.450> possibly<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.350> nope<00:01:44.180> he<00:01:45.180> looks

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
I think possibly go with nope he looks

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.469 
I think possibly go with nope he looks
like<00:01:45.540> Jesus<00:01:46.040> one<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> us<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.520> scout<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.299> know

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
like Jesus one of us our scout I know

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
like Jesus one of us our scout I know
cease<00:01:48.810> fire<00:01:49.020> cease<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> scout<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.280> think

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
cease fire cease the scout and I think

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.310
