00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
when Joyce applying it she's using the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.000 
when Joyce applying it she's using the
tip<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.420> paddle<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.200> line<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.590> lip<00:03:14.799> and

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
then she's going to film so this whole

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.339 
then she's going to film so this whole
look<00:03:18.159> is<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.459> muted<00:03:18.879> smoky<00:03:19.390> look<00:03:19.599> on<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.200> eyes

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.630 
and we have a pop of color on the cheek
and<00:03:22.599> then<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.110> lip<00:03:23.290> finishes<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.159> polishes

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
and then the lip finishes and polishes

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.410 
and then the lip finishes and polishes
to<00:03:24.819> complete<00:03:25.209> look
