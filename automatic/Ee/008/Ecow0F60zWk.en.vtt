00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello and welcome approach 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 who have ever set themselves 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.420
 has engaged in animations and after 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.639
 has searched programs is probably mostly 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
 on the imprint flash encountered 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 her meat is secondary to 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 but also has a disadvantage 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 it really costs a great deal 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.820
 I have a little alternative here 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350
 On the internet found the advantage 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.510
 Of course everything is free for free 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.789
 easy to use and suitable 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.219
 also for small or even medium sized 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.230
 animation 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.520
 yes we just go through times through me 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 I explain that bit the program 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
 how it works up here on the left see 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 you in tools just that you already know 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.190
 from photoshop or paint alto normal 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:54.480
 eraser pen filler and stuff like that 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.800
 interesting here is the police if 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.170
 you keep the mouse over it a bit 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.020
 a reported the police in 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.579
 karlsruhe lines do not make here 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.090
 wonder that is a bug of the but 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.950
 end not watch when you play this 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.650
 and the advantages have just been seen 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
 have with such lines automatically on 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.210
 that means if I now the whole 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.150
 small steps I so in the circle 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 it would also indicate to the circle that is 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.580
 very convenient to confirm 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 I'll do it now and we will 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.540
 Already with animals can stop 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.229
 the time setting to the individual 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.180
 tools like thickness do the paint here 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 on the right this already a few colors 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.140
 otherwise you can use it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.159
 click it a bit more closely 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.409
 adjust 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.409
 and up here you can see the red green and green 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.710
 set blue share now come to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.880
 most important of the timeline down here 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.200
 Here you see your different layers 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 so your different layers 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.049
 so to speak, the individual coils here 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.030
 You can add new ones dedicated to bitmap 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.259
 vector sound and camera interesting here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.479
 is the camera 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.710
 the other to the two so to draw 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.840
 sound layer is natural for the sound 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.539
 so you can add the channel and we 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.780
 draw here 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:19.739
 Of course you have to do something wep bit 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.739
 drawing a layer 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.420
 my beautiful drawing 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.239
 so we can now here with the mouse 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.230
 is moving picture and so far into the picture 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.730
 move in the camera 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.379
 especially handy if here now 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.239
 picture and the break from left to right 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.389
 right 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.569
 she just has it here so long so that 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.889
 it also quite practical but how 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.519
 Do you make that over here now? 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:49.389
 that's what makes them so in the with the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.849
 gravel so if now have two pictures where 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.889
 he is once up the arm and down 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.530
 then you know the above 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.000
 stop here in the gravel concatenate 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.040
 hereby adds the new coach 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.079
 but that only applies to the respective one 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.459
 Teacher has chosen things from feeling 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.269
 black and who now, for example, in the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:14.849
 first 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:17.109
 but the same figure in the second 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.989
 Kirin still easy 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.120
 transparent lines you have here 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.280
 set by the only 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.349
 skin since I will be the lectures displayed 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 it's very convenient and too 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.290
 see how it was before 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.290
 Here you can also see the next one 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.010
 look at 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.510
 also through such transparent lines 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.799
 if you play now you can see him 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.069
 still pretty good about it 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.419
 animation to appear fluid 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.609
 if he does not , just stop here 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.540
 click on it that's why too 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.579
 watch as it was 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.989
 we do not have to trace it completely now 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.489
 we can just use the first frame 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.209
 cite stream 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.129
 and at the second strg v insert so 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.099
 now what I know gives a little bit 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.489
 his arm or such an angle child like this 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.489
 little bit 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.880
 so 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.150
 and play again for the next one 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:19.340
 next 1 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:29.330
 the copy that was already then again 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:31.970
 train and now he is still alive 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.250
 a little bit has not become so nice 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.340
 but it shows in neuss show 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.250
 the camera makes you just like that 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.270
 he adds single gravel and each one 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.620
 Camera slightly different moves this 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.400
 single gravel could be one and 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.110
 turn off 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.550
 i would like this button if he 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.090
 For example, a layer for the 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.950
 have background and that is long bisky 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.270
 24 then not anymore and at kiep 36 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.800
 Again , just turn off here 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.060
 and another layer in time 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.630
 Just activate it just like that 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.580
 back to the internet player now 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.160
 we come to the point here at the back 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.690
 with that - we wake up so here you can 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.800
 the fps so the pictures per second 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.480
 set frames per second here 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.330
 volume sound on or whether so 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.710
 or off and you can activate the loop 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.970
 So a loop that I always if 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.400
 Once again it is played by 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.650
 forward repeatedly plays the time now from 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.450
 with bow or you do not see this 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.210
 have become very nice but I have 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.700
 with the mouse drawn but it 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.560
 works of course you can the 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.570
 everything can hereby also small and 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.810
 create medium-sized animations 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.460
 you can stop also quite fluid at 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.500
 You have to keep lines for that 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.090
 contentious make the stop the gaps 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.610
 For example, in this example always 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.980
 smaller between the poor and so 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.660
 the more fluid it works if it is too long 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.150
 Just take the pictures pro 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.790
 screw it upwards 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.890
 yes that was it already has that 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.580
 free program for download in 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.640
 the neo description is just extreme 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.650
 well arranged and yes is suitable 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.380
 every case for simple animations 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.889
 then I will be very happy thumb 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.800
 high if you liked it 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.300
 Otherwise you can get suggestions in 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.979
 to write the comments 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.319
 check out a canal 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.210
 there are also many videos and 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.360
 Thank you for watching and bite 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.360
 because
