00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.250
 hello and nice that too one 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.960
 match turns you have to change 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.970
 is important and I will always 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.520
 again asked Grambow pointing it out 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.200
 again an anti and yes accordingly 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.419
 What's nicer than a German 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.699
 to unpack artillery accordingly 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.400
 10 we the opponent of intestines one 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.900
 played on the card mines what a 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.629
 very nice card for an artillery 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.879
 is and accordingly we are very 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.330
 curious what he do with it and tear 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.930
 can even be here in the train with 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:48.370
 So another gb tiger doing here 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.969
 decent collection course class 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.739
 forge 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.300
 since you know already as an opponent before where 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.059
 The way they stand always stands here 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 At the back this is the classic one can 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.300
 already say 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.440
 Accordingly it is we look 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.310
 and 10 after what he will tear her 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.110
 and this task here is of course the 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.710
 at the beginning , masters played on the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.410
 map 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.670
 he uses the bettel assistant as you do 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.549
 That's why he can see this 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.950
 cause an angle view and the 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.600
 budget that offers itself almost already 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.509
 So immediately after has loaded and the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.759
 shot out and makes ever 872 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.340
 harm to the budget that they will 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.920
 have also presented and be different 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.119
 partner is doing the double shock 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:42.869
 made the budget and the tea 62 gone 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:45.970
 there were definitely standing ovations from the 62nd 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.890
 and from the pad of the budget both are there 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.720
 not very amused about being here 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.640
 from an influential red bot 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.860
 to be killed but it comes a kiss 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.979
 miley back best answer the man 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.979
 let's give it so we can save 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.560
 go on with a bit of action as well 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.190
 such as the tee 62 playing the guys here 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.310
 continue and take out the s7 now very much 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.870
 nice and good at moving them 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.410
 So he stays after the shot 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.880
 the stupid but before he is here 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.470
 Account has got there itself 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.240
 he takes the advance by 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.140
 so I myself moved so it should 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.590
 are now on the island around 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.430
 the island is still some 61a mx or 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.200
 with only 2 mx even 1 needed the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.510
 again see who's back in Japan 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.550
 also still open on a4 always one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.000
 nice goal so the 50 b is there unfortunately 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.350
 behind the stone and also this shot 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.480
 he would be happy so my 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:01.680
 do not risk it but wait 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.880
 and hope little else is up 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.570
 maybe with a little bit of splash 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.209
 work 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:13.450
 he tries now time administrator 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:19.690
 okay i did not say anything grasser 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.670
 schott 2100 damage there he has to 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.640
 prescribe because that's because he's there 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:32.140
 Amazed it has Teewurst kritscher 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.550
 You can not do it that way either 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.630
 with the factor but even the one 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.220
 congratulate opponents 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:43.390
 But that is the rarity 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.080
 this reaction so down here 7a mx 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.390
 still open 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.720
 and he stays here hunting 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.720
 tank 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.060
 so the question is where did he go I want 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.070
 I like to get sports but where 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.070
 Shortly then he takes the 17 breast 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:15.170
 now you can shoot well too 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:23.660
 Comment maybe but definitely like 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:25.310
 we have not seen any killshot thats 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.110
 hold a curse and blessings at the same time 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.630
 long after charging time if you meet 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.100
 does the brutal damage if one 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.720
 misses you again has 40 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.720
 for a long time to drill your nose 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.870
 the esm is also now 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.250
 maybe rausgeholt so after all 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.620
 a little bit worse 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.560
 but now the jag panzer stands 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.460
 not so good for him you have to say 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.680
 right frontal and the tea 92 munich 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.430
 from now comes the 62 also in 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.430
 his nearness even 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:05.530
 the 62 hopefully here on the remains 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.800
 then lit again power too 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.180
 alfare schwede can not only seemingly 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.090
 no fire extinguisher at the start 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.820
 it is also the most brutal damage 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.480
 who comes here and hit by this 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.060
 he could be so even it was 704 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.250
 has brought out and accordingly 15 too 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.940
 He always has four and I can do that now 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.000
 betray 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.820
 600 damage done on 17 because he has in 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.790
 sum 5624 done harm and me like 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.270
 displayed here 5025 and that's straight 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.250
 four minutes 44 so incredibly horny 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.750
 Round so if I could play and 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.640
 if it were me so well would succeed 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.930
 it more often, I hope you play as 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.290
 please yours until next time 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.290
 character
