of new animations just for Connor alone
we<00:03:48.999> started<00:03:49.450> by<00:03:49.599> looking<00:03:49.780> at<00:03:50.019> lots<00:03:50.620> of

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
we started by looking at lots of

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.640 
we started by looking at lots of
military<00:03:51.310> moves<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.359> even<00:03:52.930> traditional<00:03:53.409> ones

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
military moves and even traditional ones

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.349 
military moves and even traditional ones
of<00:03:53.859> how<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.459> would<00:03:54.549> fight<00:03:54.760> with<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:54.939> tomahawk

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
of how you would fight with the tomahawk

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.209 
of how you would fight with the tomahawk
we<00:03:55.810> looked<00:03:56.079> at<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:56.530> we<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:56.920> thought<00:03:57.189> it

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
we looked at that and we just thought it

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:59.610 
we looked at that and we just thought it
wasn't<00:03:57.670> awesome<00:03:57.909> enough<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.719> we<00:03:59.109> went<00:03:59.319> really

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.220 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really
brutal<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.219> it<00:04:00.370> wasn't<00:04:00.549> just<00:04:01.109> throwing<00:04:02.109> in

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.050 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in
board

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.910 

we<00:04:10.060> put<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.390> lot<00:04:10.450> of<00:04:10.659> time<00:04:10.959> into<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.290> navigation

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
we put a lot of time into the navigation

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.430 
we put a lot of time into the navigation
elements<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.549> we've<00:04:13.180> completely<00:04:13.720> redone<00:04:14.230> our

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
elements and we've completely redone our

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.560 
elements and we've completely redone our
climb<00:04:14.709> system<00:04:15.159> we<00:04:15.519> really<00:04:15.909> wanted<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.449> be

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
climb system we really wanted it to be

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.259 
climb system we really wanted it to be
much<00:04:16.780> more<00:04:16.810> organic<00:04:17.760> there's<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.060> much

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
much more organic there's so much

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.090 
much more organic there's so much
variety<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.930> what<00:04:20.079> he<00:04:20.139> can<00:04:20.290> climb<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.829> how<00:04:21.040> we

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
variety and what he can climb and how we

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.879 
variety and what he can climb and how we
can<00:04:21.280> do<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.780> Connor<00:04:22.780> moves<00:04:23.080> are<00:04:23.350> directly
