00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.710
 Of course, the car will be complete in the beginning 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.869
 Look closely and the parts we share 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 then you have to build your car too 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.640
 fit the whole shape of the car 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.949
 but that means that you only talk in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.779
 Quite normal in quotes 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.670
 series vehicle and then have so 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.090
 work exactly i have the data 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.590
 from the series vehicle that I have 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 here on my screen a computer 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.309
 and can work with it and constructive 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:51.300
 construct our places to do so 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:53.309
 arises the conversion kit for the SLS is 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.570
 what are these tools for that in 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.969
 clay working tools 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.859
 a plasticine on a wax base 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.500
 60 degrees is heated and over again 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.970
 can be used on one to one model 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.369
 the designer can shape and shape 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.550
 proportions of the parts exactly 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.770
 work out 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.429
 Andreas and Lucy model one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.429
 air inlet 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.380
 hello hello hello if i have a car 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.650
 drive no problem on the spot 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.130
 We'll do it right on the spot 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.670
 location 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.670
 in the brabus e v12 with 800 ps 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.690
 mom dad 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.690
 a little bit more 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.280
 more 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.159
 the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 200 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.790
 200 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.790
 and then let it roll out slowly 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.720
 your 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720
 O 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.140
 Wow 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:55.170
 was fun it is real 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:58.140
 But standing on the gas and so looks 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.620
 a finished brabus super mess of the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.230
 bullet on c class basis with 750 ps and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.410
 electronically limited 1100 newton meters 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.410
 torque 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.900
 I mean we have a lot of 63 liters now 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.989
 biturbo motor that means two 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.880
 completely new brabus turbochargers no 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.780
 gates that you can buy as conventional 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.000
 but really a complete one 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.860
 own development is really nice yet 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.660
 then the motor actually belongs 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.070
 not maximum because you get into a 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.230
 c class 8 cylinder engine with a maximum of 4 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.790
 176 ps so you in the car as a body 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.230
 or next to the body variant there 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.959
 it despise maximum that have now 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.640
 so not only has a v12 biturbo here 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.579
 the plant linda more but we have 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.130
 Of course , again completely biturbo 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.670
 engine it is also turbo charged we 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.670
 have over 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.709
 100 ps more than the interior series 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.280
 is in no way inferior to the outside 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.370
 of course, a call was a 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.989
 leather upholstery really the whole 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.430
 ground no test i am anymore but 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.319
 really everything in leather itself 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.700
 the ground already we have here 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.260
 everyone is down again 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.260
 prank the bottroper is a conversion 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.959
 package for the sls amg velvet body 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.959
 elements sports suspension and 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.959
 exhaust system 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.979
 Of course the car is a must 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.900
 you just say we move 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.030
 with the sls in a benchmark to one 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.710
 Porsche turbo to the 911 turbo 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.510
 which of course has a long history 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.880
 as well as the car actually long 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.889
 history leaning from the 300 sl gullwing of 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.669
 the wing-door car to it in the 60s 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.470
 years ago 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.810
 that was a special car that is yes 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.080
 such a renaissance of this vehicle 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.280
 again and again what leads to develop 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.650
 and to do that to that 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.660
 vehicle fits and is not too much and 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.160
 not too few , so the tuning is 100 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.479
 euro says exactly what i would like to have that 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.110
 of course a big challenge for you 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.669
 the colleagues 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.970
 we have seen that up here too 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.970
 design like these parts, so to speak as new 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.640
 developed added yes what we have 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.350
 here in carbon diffuser the same 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.210
 material what formula-1 teams use 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.130
 we have titanium exhaust system 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.630
 that is a failure so the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.250
 made of stainless steel or steel 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.979
 of course with us only from stainless steel 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.479
 but here we use titan titan 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.910
 much lighter than stainless steel that 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.310
 means save with such an exhaust system 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.330
 40 of the weight over the series 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.620
 exhaust systems 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.610
 this corresponds to a brown layer 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.650
 alone always twelve kilograms 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.229
 There are also many for the cockpit 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:35.099
 accessories a motor tuning success in 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.099
 I am very thankful for the briefness of the post 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.330
 i had a lot of fun i hope that 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.349
 but our audience had fun 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.370
 I'm really convinced of that 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.610
 had 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.539
 thanks again to all the staff 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.379
 would say you see each other again 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.379
 have fun
