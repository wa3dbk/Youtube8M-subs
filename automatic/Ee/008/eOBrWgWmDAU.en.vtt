so this is the final project of the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.080 
so this is the final project of the
semester<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:34.390> final<00:00:34.660> project<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.380> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
semester and the final project is a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.130 
semester and the final project is a
comprehensive<00:00:37.090> project<00:00:37.630> involving

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
comprehensive project involving

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.540 
comprehensive project involving
everything<00:00:38.530> we've<00:00:38.680> done<00:00:38.860> through<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.160> cement

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
everything we've done through the cement

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.979 
everything we've done through the cement
we<00:00:39.640> pass<00:00:39.879> through<00:00:39.910> things<00:00:40.390> all<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.660> time<00:00:40.690> in

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
we pass through things all the time in

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.770 
we pass through things all the time in
architecture<00:00:41.590> doorways<00:00:42.430> in<00:00:42.700> particular<00:00:43.239> and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
architecture doorways in particular and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.600 
architecture doorways in particular and
those<00:00:44.020> doorways<00:00:44.260> change<00:00:44.800> us<00:00:45.070> because<00:00:45.460> it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
those doorways change us because it

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.759 
those doorways change us because it
deals<00:00:45.790> with<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.510> place<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.320> other<00:00:47.470> side

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
deals with the place on the other side

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.259 
deals with the place on the other side
of<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.920> door<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.460> place<00:00:48.670> on<00:00:48.879> this<00:00:49.030> side

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
of the door and the place on this side

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.240 
of the door and the place on this side
of<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.420> door<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:50.110> transition<00:00:50.800> victor<00:00:51.160> is

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
of the door that transition victor is

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.420 
of the door that transition victor is
pretty<00:00:51.760> challenging<00:00:53.190> there's<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.339> many

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
pretty challenging there's so many

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.710 
pretty challenging there's so many
different<00:00:54.610> interpretations<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.540> when

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
different interpretations of it when

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.229 
different interpretations of it when
people<00:00:55.989> see<00:00:56.199> it<00:00:56.290> as<00:00:56.440> like<00:00:57.070> a<00:00:57.190> calm<00:00:57.460> silent<00:00:57.790> some

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
people see it as like a calm silent some

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.780 
people see it as like a calm silent some
people<00:00:58.510> can<00:00:58.660> see<00:00:58.839> it<00:00:58.960> as<00:00:59.080> I<00:00:59.350> get<00:00:59.920> angry<00:01:00.160> silence

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
people can see it as I get angry silence

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.859 
people can see it as I get angry silence
so<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.750> kind<00:01:01.960> of<00:01:02.019> have<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.369> convey<00:01:03.369> both<00:01:03.869> yeah

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
so you kind of have to convey both yeah

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.660 
so you kind of have to convey both yeah
I<00:01:04.900> think<00:01:05.049> I<00:01:05.290> think<00:01:05.860> every<00:01:06.010> was<00:01:06.100> pretty<00:01:06.280> excited

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
I think I think every was pretty excited

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.430 
I think I think every was pretty excited
but<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:07.000> know<00:01:07.240> being<00:01:07.540> able<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.840> design<00:01:08.380> our

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
but you know being able to design our

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.560 
but you know being able to design our
own<00:01:08.590> thing<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.130> build<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.240> all<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.479> way

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
own thing and build it all the way

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.390 
own thing and build it all the way
through<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:10.960> get<00:01:11.080> over<00:01:11.260> to<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.470> people<00:01:11.890> I've

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
through and get over to the people I've

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.130 
through and get over to the people I've
talked<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.700> some<00:01:12.820> upperclassmen<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.600> they

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
talked to some upperclassmen and they

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.719 
talked to some upperclassmen and they
tell<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.740> know<00:01:14.830> they<00:01:14.950> told<00:01:15.070> me<00:01:15.250> this<00:01:15.430> is<00:01:15.580> going

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
tell you know they told me this is going

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.330 
tell you know they told me this is going
to<00:01:15.790> be<00:01:15.880> like<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.030> turning<00:01:16.960> point<00:01:16.990> in<00:01:17.350> our<00:01:18.010> design

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
to be like a turning point in our design

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.850 
to be like a turning point in our design
first<00:01:18.970> time<00:01:19.240> they<00:01:19.390> use<00:01:19.420> any<00:01:19.750> kind<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.080> scale

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
first time they use any kind of scale

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.429 
first time they use any kind of scale
model<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.720> working<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.869> small<00:01:22.990> scale

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
model and working in a small scale

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.260 
model and working in a small scale
doesn't<00:01:23.710> include<00:01:24.070> all<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.430> reality<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.060> the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
doesn't include all the reality that the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.399 
doesn't include all the reality that the
full<00:01:25.570> scale<00:01:25.840> will<00:01:26.020> have<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.720> scaled<00:01:29.020> models

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
full scale will have the scaled models

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.999 
full scale will have the scaled models
work<00:01:29.619> for<00:01:30.310> referencing<00:01:31.180> but<00:01:31.780> also<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.590> lot

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
work for referencing but also a lot

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.110 
work for referencing but also a lot
stronger<00:01:33.430> than<00:01:34.180> what<00:01:34.660> we<00:01:34.810> actually<00:01:34.960> get<00:01:35.320> up

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
stronger than what we actually get up

stronger than what we actually get up
another<00:01:37.120> time<00:01:37.480> enough<00:01:37.930> we<00:01:38.320> can<00:01:38.500> only<00:01:38.710> use<00:01:40.920> 656
