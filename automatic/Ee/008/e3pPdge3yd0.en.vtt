up now which Johnny plays on a lot I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.929 
up now which Johnny plays on a lot I
don't<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.439> same<00:01:46.649> configuration<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
don't have the same configuration of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
don't have the same configuration of
guitar<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.479> him<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.079> I've<00:01:49.530> used<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:50.009> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
guitar as him so I've used the one that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.469 
guitar as him so I've used the one that
I<00:01:50.189> could<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> sound<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> most<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I could get to sound the most like it

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.899 
I could get to sound the most like it
which<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:52.439> 52<00:01:52.979> tele<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.460> let's<00:01:53.700> give<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
which is my 52 tele so let's give this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:08.350 
which is my 52 tele so let's give this
go

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.490 

so<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.540> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.750> hear<00:02:09.930> it<00:02:10.020> sounds<00:02:10.170> pretty<00:02:10.380> cool

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
so as you can hear it sounds pretty cool

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.110 
so as you can hear it sounds pretty cool
it's<00:02:10.860> nice<00:02:11.010> and<00:02:11.190> bluesy<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.730> got<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.880> bit<00:02:12.030> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's nice and bluesy it's got a bit of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's nice and bluesy it's got a bit of
overtime<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.780> already<00:02:20.000> now<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.300> great

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
overtime on it already now the great

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.060 
overtime on it already now the great
thing<00:02:21.510> about<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.020> time<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.890> turn

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
thing about this time is if you turn

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:32.240 
thing about this time is if you turn
down<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.610> cleans<00:02:23.850> up<00:02:24.060> quite<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> lot<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:32.160> is

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
down it cleans up quite a lot this is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.120 
down it cleans up quite a lot this is
with<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> backup<00:02:36.620> while<00:02:37.620> Johnny<00:02:37.920> lang

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
with a backup while Johnny lang

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.920 
with a backup while Johnny lang
definitely<00:02:38.580> plays<00:02:38.760> with<00:02:39.000> loads<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.390> attack<00:02:39.690> on

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
definitely plays with loads of attack on

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.140 
definitely plays with loads of attack on
his<00:02:40.140> guitar<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.800> can't<00:02:41.460> really<00:02:41.580> emulate<00:02:42.000> his

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
his guitar I can't really emulate his

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.060 
his guitar I can't really emulate his
style<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.660> much<00:02:42.810> part<00:02:43.110> from<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.350> few<00:02:43.590> little

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
style too much part from a few little

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.220 
style too much part from a few little
bits<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.520> pieces<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.020> what<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
bits and pieces so this is what the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.810 
bits and pieces so this is what the
overdrive<00:02:46.710> still<00:02:47.040> off<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
overdrive still off this is just the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.520 
overdrive still off this is just the
same<00:02:48.030> tone<00:02:48.270> as<00:02:48.450> before<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:48.990> for<00:02:49.170> some<00:02:49.350> lead

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
same tone as before but for some lead

00:02:49.530 --> 00:03:08.700 
same tone as before but for some lead
stuff

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.740 

so<00:03:09.710> Johnny's<00:03:10.130> lead<00:03:10.340> tone<00:03:10.610> can<00:03:10.970> get<00:03:11.120> seriously

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
so Johnny's lead tone can get seriously

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.020 
so Johnny's lead tone can get seriously
dirty<00:03:12.140> but<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.560> sounds<00:03:13.010> great<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.400> love<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.790> and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
dirty but it sounds great I love it and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.600 
dirty but it sounds great I love it and
I'm<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:14.690> big<00:03:14.900> fan<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.320> kind<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.710> tone<00:03:15.950> so

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
I'm a big fan of that kind of tone so

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.460 
I'm a big fan of that kind of tone so
this<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:16.910> with<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.090> overdrive<00:03:17.450> off<00:03:17.660> again

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:48.260 

this<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.710> on

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:56.440 

back<00:03:49.270> off

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.600 

I<00:03:59.260> had<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> chance<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.650> use<00:04:00.830> this<00:04:00.950> preset<00:04:01.190> last

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
I had a chance to use this preset last

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.000 
I had a chance to use this preset last
