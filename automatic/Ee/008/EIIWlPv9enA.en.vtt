00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.720
 that they are doing it in a way that I could say 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 much much more professional much more happy intensively 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.089
 that so many discs this Saturday what have been the successful 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.359

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.709

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.179

 It has made us sweat but 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.610
 I think that edesur tries to put all the effort to get it out 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.700
 good material and I think we are achieving it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 currently a record that can compete on the radio 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.770
 and that can compete 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.360
