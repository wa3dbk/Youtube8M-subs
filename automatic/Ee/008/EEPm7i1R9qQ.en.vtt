00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 for a new optimization video 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.720
 in which I will show you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.759
 how to show who is the master to your 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.490
 applications that do not want to close 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.810
 so you have sometimes already had I do not 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.379
 do not know if you've seen it before but 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.660
 accept applications that bug 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.010
 completely and you only have 20 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.920
 do you ask them to ask them to 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.040
 leave via the menu here quit or so 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 how does a docu anything 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.280
 not walk 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.980
 and then finally good you turned off 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.510
 and restart your computer so that 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.460
 it works again I'll show you 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.180
 how to force an application 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.399
 acquitted so that it works all the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.989
 time even if it bug or what are you 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.180
 sure if you do that the application 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.320
 will close 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.960
 we knew how to do that with all 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.460
 applications and even with the finder so 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.320
 but that's going to restart the finder because 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.250
 that the finder must be all the time 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.930
 open this is a rule on mac os x 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.210
 it's just doing the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.369
 shortcut commands halt 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.860
 and then the key esc which is all 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.399
 at the top left you do that and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.250
 it throws you this little this little 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.690
 window and that tells you if a 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.369
 application unlock select his 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.450
 name then click revive here his 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.770
 marks and revive because I am 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.619
 on the finder but let's say that I want 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.420
 safari there I want it going to put forced to 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.890
 leave then you can also 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.030
 find this menu by doing everything 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.060
 simply apple menu forced to leave 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.849
 here served by hand so if you prefer 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.289
 go into the menus of the interface or 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.890
 if you prefer the shortcuts good this 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.770
 it's up to you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.810
 and so I can for example forced to 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.099
 leave safari so how's it going 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.679
 so you see that my safari is 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:06.039
 open admit small bug it's not the 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.599
 case but let's admit I'm opening 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.620
 so this window I select his 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.370
 paris force to leave then here me 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.580
 warns that all changes 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.739
 unsaved will be lost etc 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.760
 we do not care in force to leave and mons 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.340
 at free has closed 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.480
 so depending on the size of the application 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.950
 the number of open files with 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.780
 the application etc it takes more or less 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.980
 from time to close you can be 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.780
 sure after three in the world it's over 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:38.730
 what is it a bit of a method 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.519
 a little brutal in quotation marks but that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.140
 can be very interesting if you have 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.220
 bug problems with inapa is a 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.700
 application especially 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.810
 so after if you really have to 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.319
 more and more bugs with this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.940
 application may be appealing to 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.950
 developers or keep if you do not 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.230
 not an update of available because 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.049
 that theoretically there is something 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.549
 of normal step so maybe made 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.139
 attention but in any case if really 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.129
 that bug 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.870
 you can raise is like that and 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.030
 so if you have any 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.900
 other concern especially concerns at the level 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.879
 graphic I had had I was 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.450
 still under snow leopard but I'm g 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.620
 use this example a problem with 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.829
 an icon or knew that now on 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.389
 a lot of claude websites 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.970
 youtube style or the self I put my 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.530
 videos online then upload them on 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.000
 can now use what they 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.160
 call the drag and drop technology 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.540
 that is, you take the file you 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.769
 select it drag it 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.079
 in in the window of the site and he 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.819
 he recognizes it the lead I had a 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.230
 problem with this thing that is to say 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.239
 that I had a video some high schools 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.190
 on youtube it's going very well 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.230
 except that when I'm closed in paris 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.720
 I had a ghost icon a little bit that 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.160
 was stuck like that and I could 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.129
 open any application on 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.510
 any is the name at the time there 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.769
 not going to another office yet but 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.790
 I could go back any 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.500
 application there was always this 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.629
 icon that remained and ben when you 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.159
 have problems like that thought 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.629
 to do the same thing but with the 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.879
 finder and you simply 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.269
 raise the finder up and there you go 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.819
 see here a little by little a disc 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.949
 light will turn off and then 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.269
 turn it back on indicating that the finder 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.280
 his raises and here we have not seen 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.380
 because he was 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.380
 me m pixelmator may 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.240
 but that's how it works 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.770
 so that unfortunately alas for example I had 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.870
 did that but my nikon was gone 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.319
 So here is a little trick you must 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.490
 the knowledge 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:39.039
 these present in bone x so I remember 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.509
 here or at their orders stop at them 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.500
 that's all it will be in the 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.050
 description of the video 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.470
 and so here is another little trick 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.800
 of optimization ben I tell you to very 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.530
 soon 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.639
 do not hesitate to find them my background 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.280
 in the description of the video 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.050
 is a wallpaper somewhat special 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.190
 I find a little weird Celtic like 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.210
 that but that's what it takes for all 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.440
 tastes anyway it's for you 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.340
 that I get up his screen so I try 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.630
 to put some for all 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.729
 world 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.789
 here and good very soon and a little 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.789
 day
