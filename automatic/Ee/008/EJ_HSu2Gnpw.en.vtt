into<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:18.770> flour<00:01:19.300> just<00:01:20.300> like<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:25.270> ok<00:01:26.270> now

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
into the flour just like that ok now

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.499 
into the flour just like that ok now
watch<00:01:26.690> how<00:01:27.039> everything<00:01:28.039> comes<00:01:28.369> in<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.880> forms

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
watch how everything comes in and forms

a<00:01:29.690> ball<00:01:30.080> of<00:01:30.440> dough<00:01:31.090> towards<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.240> end<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.690> then

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
a ball of dough towards the end and then

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.750 
a ball of dough towards the end and then
we<00:01:32.990> stop<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.530> food<00:01:33.799> processor

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:52.390 

okay<00:01:41.570> here<00:01:41.840> goes

ball you take the ball out and you just
let<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.010> rest<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.580> little<00:01:59.640> while<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:01.560> could

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
let it rest for a little while you could

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.500 
let it rest for a little while you could
put<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.190> refrigerator<00:02:02.730> for<00:02:03.030> example

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
put it in the refrigerator for example

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.080 
put it in the refrigerator for example
or<00:02:03.690> just<00:02:03.720> let<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.080> sit<00:02:04.790> now

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
moist all the way through by letting it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.320 
moist all the way through by letting it
rest<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.260> after<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.370> we're<00:02:17.850> going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> take

and divide it into four parts put three
of<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> parts<00:02:22.140> back<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> refrigerator

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
of the parts back into the refrigerator

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.470 
of the parts back into the refrigerator
and<00:02:24.890> we'll<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:26.070> working<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:27.000> one<00:02:27.300> of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and we'll be working with just one of

so and then we'll be taking if you don't
have<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> cutter<00:03:18.980> that's<00:03:19.980> shaped<00:03:20.550> like<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:21.660> it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
have a cutter that's shaped like like it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.290 
have a cutter that's shaped like like it
should<00:03:22.050> be<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:23.010> can<00:03:23.190> use<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.970> little

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
should be then you can use this little

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.030 
should be then you can use this little
piece<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.570> paper<00:03:24.870> especially<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
piece of paper especially this is a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.140 
piece of paper especially this is a
post-it<00:03:27.890> it's<00:03:28.890> about<00:03:29.310> three<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.790> half<00:03:29.940> by

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
post-it it's about three and a half by

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.070 
post-it it's about three and a half by
three<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> half<00:03:31.970> okay<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.450> then<00:03:33.570> just<00:03:33.600> take

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
three and a half okay and then just take

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.980 
three and a half okay and then just take
your<00:03:35.040> regular<00:03:35.250> pizza<00:03:36.120> cutter<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.480> cut

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990

your regular pizza cutter and cut
yourself<00:03:37.770> out<00:03:40.460> some<00:03:41.460> pieces<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:42.000> this

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.960 

now<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.750> could<00:03:48.260> roll<00:03:48.770> this<00:03:48.950> out<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.220> whole<00:03:49.670> lot

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
now you could roll this out a whole lot

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.510 
now you could roll this out a whole lot
thinner<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.740> had<00:03:51.920> one<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.160> those<00:03:52.540> Pizza

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
thinner if you had one of those Pizza

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.890 
thinner if you had one of those Pizza
are<00:03:55.520> not<00:03:55.760> pizza<00:03:56.000> but<00:03:57.760> spaghetti<00:03:58.900> dough

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
are not pizza but spaghetti dough

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:10.559 
are not pizza but spaghetti dough
rollers<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.100> see<00:04:02.680> occasionally

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.920 

now<00:04:11.110> we're<00:04:11.650> gonna<00:04:12.090> hold<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.269> together<00:04:13.689> with

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
now we're gonna hold this together with

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.929 
now we're gonna hold this together with
just<00:04:14.200> take<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> little<00:04:14.829> bit<00:04:15.040> of<00:04:15.129> water<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.700> wet

just take a little bit of water and wet
the<00:04:16.359> end<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.810> okay

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.020 

and<00:04:20.410> we're<00:04:21.009> going<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.220> be<00:04:21.370> rolling<00:04:21.639> all<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
and we're going to be rolling all the

and we're going to be rolling all the
pieces<00:04:22.979> onto<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.460> dowels<00:04:24.699> and<00:04:25.090> getting<00:04:25.419> them

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
pieces onto the dowels and getting them

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:35.869 
pieces onto the dowels and getting them
ready<00:04:25.750> for<00:04:26.050> frying

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.179 

now<00:04:36.449> supposedly<00:04:37.020> we<00:04:37.349> would<00:04:37.499> have<00:04:37.679> a<00:04:37.709> whole<00:04:37.949> lot

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:38.189 
now supposedly we would have a whole lot

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:39.980 
now supposedly we would have a whole lot
more<00:04:38.429> here<00:04:38.759> if<00:04:38.909> we<00:04:39.059> roll<00:04:39.330> our<00:04:39.509> dough<00:04:39.539> out

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
more here if we roll our dough out

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.159 
more here if we roll our dough out
thinner<00:04:40.319> now<00:04:41.249> there<00:04:41.459> you<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:41.779> 375<00:04:42.779> degrees

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
thinner now there you have 375 degrees

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.339 
thinner now there you have 375 degrees
and<00:04:43.199> we're<00:04:43.529> ready<00:04:43.740> now<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.009> took<00:04:44.159> this<00:04:44.520> spider

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
and we're ready now I took this spider

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.809 
and we're ready now I took this spider
to<00:04:46.349> hold<00:04:46.619> them<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:46.919> place<00:04:46.949> because<00:04:47.429> they<00:04:47.699> have

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
to hold them in place because they have

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.109 
to hold them in place because they have
a<00:04:47.849> tendency<00:04:48.209> to<00:04:48.449> roll<00:04:48.809> over<00:04:48.839> to<00:04:49.879> whatever<00:04:50.879> the

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:51.119 
a tendency to roll over to whatever the

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:55.100 
a tendency to roll over to whatever the
heaviest<00:04:51.449> part<00:04:51.869> is<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:53.509> you<00:04:54.509> want<00:04:54.719> it<00:04:54.779> to<00:04:54.929> cook

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
heaviest part is and you want it to cook

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.609 
heaviest part is and you want it to cook
uniformly<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:57.270> best<00:04:57.479> way<00:04:57.689> is<00:04:57.899> to<00:04:57.929> have<00:04:58.319> a

00:04:58.609 --> 00:04:58.619 
uniformly the best way is to have a

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:02.419 
uniformly the best way is to have a
whole<00:04:58.949> lot<00:04:58.979> of<00:04:59.360> oil<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.839> the<00:05:01.199> fryer<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:01.830> then

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:02.429 
whole lot of oil in the fryer and then

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:04.519 
whole lot of oil in the fryer and then
they<00:05:02.639> will<00:05:03.089> cook<00:05:03.389> uniformly<00:05:04.050> if<00:05:04.259> they're

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
they will cook uniformly if they're

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.639 
they will cook uniformly if they're
allowed<00:05:04.889> to<00:05:04.949> roll<00:05:05.580> around<00:05:05.729> in<00:05:06.089> there<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:07.319> their

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:07.649 
allowed to roll around in there on their

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:13.839 
allowed to roll around in there on their
own<00:05:10.279> okay<00:05:11.279> so<00:05:11.550> now<00:05:11.939> little<00:05:12.330> by<00:05:12.449> little<00:05:12.719> we<00:05:13.019> will

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
own okay so now little by little we will

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.949 
own okay so now little by little we will
make<00:05:14.849> a<00:05:14.879> dozen<00:05:15.389> here<00:05:17.149> and<00:05:18.149> to<00:05:18.419> take<00:05:18.599> them<00:05:18.809> out
