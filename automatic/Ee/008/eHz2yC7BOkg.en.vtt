00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.389
 very good data kids but the 14 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.529
 here begin and welcome one more day 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.999
 to your channel and we are in the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.529
 presentation of a new skin the league 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:09.600
 of legends in this case although I do not know 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 recognize a lot is sweet is called twitch 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.950
 pickpocket in English and it would translate 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.450
 as pickpocketing or pickpocket be tweets 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.699
 you know we 're having a theme 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.769
 a bit of cops and thieves in these 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.230
 last videos we had the tram skin 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.960
 of what was an anti-riot type 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.519
 so to speak we have bolivar that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.869
 it was like a police officer a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.640
 bit ridiculous but an officer of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.560
 police in this case we have the extreme 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.989
 opposite let's not say to the rat that always 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.239
 It has been characterized as a character 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 bad or bad vengeful or a little 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 crawling not a rat basically and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 we have the thief rat that the truth 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 is that I personally like it a lot 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 especially the gun I think it's 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.179
 very cool this revolver carries 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.090
 the poison bombs behind has its 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.469
 classic pestilence its tail that looks 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.269
 really me who spends a skunk on 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 reality and then it takes then it's typical 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.410
 not the cap and the mask so that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.329
 do not discover do not go with like the typical 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.789
 the thief of these old movies 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.739
 well, that's why I really like the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.510
 not good but we 'll go to see 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.860
 the animations little by little for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.130
 to see how the character moves 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.200
 etc 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.240
 here we have the first one that only 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.150
 he smells he eats it, he also eats it with 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 craving we'll even see the second 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.490
 the face is brutal or it seems that it is 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.540
 very possessed and I with those eyes dancing 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.200
 there's the rocker dance 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.030
 Y 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.009
 laughter really are people who do not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.350
 very much like the aesthetic that it has is very 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.939
 very fun to see the truth is cool 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.590
 lots but good let's start to see 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.289
 the skills let's start with the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.170
 cv that is the invisibility here the 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.640
 we have and trinity and we go invisible and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.649
 then typical the bonus that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.899
 we get here we have the attacks 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.399
 basic as you see soar in a single 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.920
 shot with the revolver if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.619
 with the skin for example one is called 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.119
 mercenary the one that carries the machine gun 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.560
 so shoot several bullets but good 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.700
 they do not really do the damage of several 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.220
 bullets but they do the damage of a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.390
 proven animations is the same is the one of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.270
 several bullets because in this case we have 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.860
 one really picks up the revolver with the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.049
 two hands as I'm seeing that is 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.519
 really quite heavy the truth in 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.319
 the sense for gave it to be a little 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.390
 mitigate that recoil that has the weapon or 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.950
 things like that I do not have the slightest idea but 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.840
 well let's stop scratching us the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.610
 head and let's see the good w we're going to 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 combine w ye to go a little bit more 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.680
 quick wait for them to bunch up a bit 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.269
 and there will have a double vee that is the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.780
 little vial of poison and he is purging 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.489
 online basically is this is what 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.290
 same but cool cool a lot I do not know to 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.160
 me personally how do I say this skin 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.540
 you know if I do not like it 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.520
 skins I tell you I do not have any 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 problem in this case this one cool me 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.360
 heap so we 're not going to wait for 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.150
 come the next wave to try the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.950
 final ability or the last one because in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.360
 this wave, well, it's not worth it 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.830
 because it's going to end now so come 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.030
 let's try it and activate and there goes 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.210
 it's really cool because it 's like a super 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.670
 cannon shot or is it a cannon shot that 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.440
 shoots like jets of poison that is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.030
 very hardcore it's like I have a 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.550
 poison hose really and will start 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.650
 plug people but still good 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.300
 It is very well the truth and me 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.920
 I personally like it a lot 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.540
 so well let's see the cowboy and 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.700
 finally death but good will 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.350
 start with the cowboy you put the is 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.190
 in the back it starts to come back as 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.190
 a rat goes looking for 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.470
 it goes there it is and well we are going to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.660
 buy us the mobility boots 5 and the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.800
 improvement to get out faster base 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.300
 to be able to get there before we go there mola 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.440
 how it actually runs when when 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.180
 has the speed because it gets to 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.310
 four legs and it's more like that rat 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.140
 fetid is not going to go out to flash and everything 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.610
 to get there before and finally we're going to 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.680
 see how I say death to see if this 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.570
 bet remember that this is a kind 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.170
 of alpha so to speak that the ones the 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.060
 characters are not entirely created by 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.709
 so to say many yes but good there 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.810
 some that as you see as you know 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.300
 some things are missing but good we go 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.980
 to move on to see what death said 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.540
 basically that goes off towards 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.190
 doing like a kind of corkscrew 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.690
 in the air and death falls the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.190
 revolver here as well as the kids 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.780
 I hope you liked the video line 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.400
 favorite if it's like that and see you in the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.580
 next a greeting to all and up 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.580
 then
