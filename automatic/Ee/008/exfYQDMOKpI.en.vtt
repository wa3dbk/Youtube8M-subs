the first thing that makes the Hellcat
so<00:00:40.770> special<00:00:41.220> is<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.330> most<00:00:42.600> obvious<00:00:42.930> thing<00:00:43.380> is

functional<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.550> spent<00:01:46.850> thirty<00:01:47.120> five<00:01:47.300> percent

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330
