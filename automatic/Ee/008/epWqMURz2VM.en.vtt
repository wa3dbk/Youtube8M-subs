00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I have a mapping mechanism for 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.049
 attracting migrant workers from 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.900
 visa-free states and what was 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.360
 earlier on our mechanism 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 it's really complicated enough for 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.539
 employer because pre- assess 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.980
 your need next year 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 attracting workers guys catch 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 very difficult plus respectively 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 was quite cumbersome and beyond 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 I have specified the filing procedure 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
 applications 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
 passing both on regional and on 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.850
 federal level various commissions 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.980
 in order for a specific employer 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.960
 to issue 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.309
 even one moment it was of course 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 prohibitive primarily for 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.410
 small and medium businesses we 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
 of course individual entrepreneurs 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.850
 present moment all employer 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.100
 no equal rights any 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.350
 the employer may legally from May 1 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.180
 attract migrant workers those 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.989
 the number of which is him 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.469
 it is necessary about the loss of how to go 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.449
 on 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.219
 answer your questions and then just 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.009
 recalled the list of documents that 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.020
 required to obtain a patent 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.509
 First of all, this is of course a statement 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.080
 increase this document certifying 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.630
 personality 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.450
 which is important migration card with 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.820
 This goal works an important aspect. 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.369
 every migration needs to be understood 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.560
 because if will be indicated 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.990
 another place documents are accepted 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.450
 just wo nâ€™t be this medical insurance 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.220
 These are documents that arrive 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.069
 he does not have HIV infection 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.020
 that he is not ill with addiction diseases 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.720
 suffering from infectious diseases 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.460
 social danger components 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.200
 accordingly what we talked about in 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.390
 document confirming possession of Russian 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.409
 based on the history of legislation 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.240
 Russian Federation 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.399
 Well, respectively, after receiving 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.259
 patent accentuates this 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.569
 attention he is subject to the procedure 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.549
 endoscopic registration required 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.020
 and photos and all this information 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.750
 accumulates our 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.000
 according to which not all scientific all 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.530
 controlling the right to store and here on 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.140
 present moment package which 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.080
 issued to install for work only in 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.399
 individuals it will be possible last 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.489
 times extend in December 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.950
 once again from one month to three and he 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.709
 will allow the rights to work during the first 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.470
 a maximum of three months 15 but only 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.210
 from individuals and legal entities in this 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.790
 opportunity 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.620
 not have failed to provide work for the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.540
 period of time I repeat from 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.910
 months to three if the migrant does not understand 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.080
 leave the territory of the Russian Federation 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.120
 In principle, this season is now 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.530
 New Year's Eve with us is just seasonal 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.560
 just from dad and grants going 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.760
 because all of his home to meet 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 New Year's holidays with family but 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.500
 if here remains in this case for 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.730
 this period of his legal stay on 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.710
 from a month to three 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.110
 he will tie up to assemble a new package 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.730
 documents on the key new package yet 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.890
 once tried again the semi pack will be 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.890
 be from month to 12 depending 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.530
 here is the desire of the migrants themselves that 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.020
 regards payment package means December 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.690
 of course it will be 1216 rubles 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.830
 because more acute attitudes are concerned 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.960
 tax budget legislation 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.200
 sing force backs say 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.540
 15th year still inflicted on 1 federal 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.640
 a law which is also inferior by 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.180
 next year, I first of my 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.740
 today's correction entry 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.470
 talked about our migration 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.210
 legislation as has two core 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.920
 directions against illegal 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.190
 fixation migrations respectively 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.250
 liberalization of migration procedures so 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.190
 Here is a law that increase 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.290
 terms of the so-called closure entry 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.600
 respect of those persons who are long 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.610
 time are 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.740
 in the Russian Federation and without a break 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.630
 most likely likely as a rule 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.640
 He considers illegal employment 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.600
 you know what until recently 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.120
 such decided by us was decided on 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.950
 the closure of the entry for three years was taken 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.560
 were taken against those who 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.850
 have exceeded their legal stay 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.270
 over a month 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.070
 over 30 days that is 90 minus 30 from 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.750
 respectively 120 days of continuous 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.760
 here being without clearance 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.860
 any permits 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.260
 matches the streets closes weight 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.420
 for three years by federal law 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.540
 it is established that if this juice is 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.070
 there are 90 will be plus one hundred eighty five 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.440
 years and if it is 90 plus 270 that is 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.200
 In general, in the general axis, we go to 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.530
 organic term is not bagni specific 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.590
 stay this will be 10 here it is another 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.720
 innovation that is, we repeat again 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.910
 we create normal understandable conditions for 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.580
 legal here stay finding 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.890
 than I said on the incentive migrants 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.660
 who do not want to comply with Russian 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.880
 laws we will of course do 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.520
 tough enough and basic of course 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.780
 view of the world associated with the closure published 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.700
 is most effective 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.380
 because on the one hand we do not spend 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.060
 federal budget money 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.430
 administrative janrev is not afraid 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.140
 deportation of money in this case as 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.880
 - the other side of micron we have 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.100
 opportunities to re-enter here 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.930
 legally he loses essentially doing 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.560
 opportunity to take advantage of their right 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:16.210
 on labor and make money for that 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.210
 he feeds his exact family
