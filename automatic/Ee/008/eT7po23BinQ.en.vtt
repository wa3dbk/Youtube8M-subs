00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this it's more like this so the arch of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.920 
this it's more like this so the arch of
my<00:00:25.470> foot<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:26.039> kind<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> rail<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.720> looks

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
my foot is kind of on that rail so looks

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.790 
my foot is kind of on that rail so looks
something<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.140> this

amount of speed so you can have some

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.920 
amount of speed so you can have some

weight off your back foot and they just
hop<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.800> 180<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> you're<00:00:53.550> gonna<00:00:53.730> sit<00:00:54.090> like

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
hop of 180 and you're gonna sit like

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.270 
hop of 180 and you're gonna sit like
this<00:00:54.270> evenly<00:00:55.260> distribute<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.800> weight<00:00:56.039> on

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this evenly distribute the weight on

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.240 
this evenly distribute the weight on
both<00:00:56.340> feet<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.840> lean<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> bit

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
both feet just like this lean back a bit

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
both feet just like this lean back a bit
so<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.550> you're<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.789> flying<00:01:00.090> forward<00:01:00.510> but

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so that you're not flying forward but

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.900 
so that you're not flying forward but
not<00:01:01.289> too<00:01:01.620> much<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.039> you're<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.309> slipping

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
not too much that you're not slipping

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.990 
not too much that you're not slipping
out<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.739> these<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.070> start<00:01:05.369> short<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
out and these will start short and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.910 
out and these will start short and
definitely<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.720> longer<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.290> time<00:01:07.500> progresses

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
definitely get longer as time progresses

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.950 
definitely get longer as time progresses
so<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:08.729> gonna<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:09.060> leaning<00:01:09.270> back<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
so you're gonna be leaning back when you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.060 
so you're gonna be leaning back when you
feel<00:01:10.110> yourself<00:01:10.260> starting<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> slow

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
feel yourself starting to slow

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
feel yourself starting to slow
essentially<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> switch<00:01:12.420> 90<00:01:12.840> technically

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
essentially do a switch 90 technically

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
essentially do a switch 90 technically
so<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.280> gonna<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.790> weight<00:01:14.970> off

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so you're gonna want to take weight off

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630 
so you're gonna want to take weight off
your<00:01:15.180> front<00:01:15.390> foot<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:16.250> just<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
your front foot and just just like that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.690 
your front foot and just just like that
you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.540> low<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:20.280> looks<00:01:20.490> easy

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can get low for that it looks easy

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.980 
you can get low for that it looks easy
when<00:01:21.030> doing<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> slide<00:01:21.570> there's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> couple

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
when doing the slide there's a couple

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.510 
when doing the slide there's a couple
things<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.040> want<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> do

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
things you really do not want to do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.090 
things you really do not want to do
because<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:23.820> would<00:01:23.939> result<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.479> falling<00:01:25.100> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because they would result in falling and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
because they would result in falling and
they'll<00:01:26.220> inflict<00:01:26.580> pain<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> main

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
they'll inflict pain one of the main

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
they'll inflict pain one of the main
problems<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.860> most<00:01:29.040> people<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:30.000> when

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
problems that most people have is when

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.450 
problems that most people have is when
they<00:01:30.450> kick<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:31.070> though<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.189> don't<00:01:32.310> have

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
they kick it out though they don't have

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
they kick it out though they don't have
enough<00:01:32.640> weight<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.850> their<00:01:33.060> heels<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.509> over

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
enough weight on their heels and over

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
enough weight on their heels and over
the<00:01:33.869> rail<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.920> point<00:01:35.280> their<00:01:35.460> toes<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the rail and they point their toes and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.789 
the rail and they point their toes and
that<00:01:36.240> means<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> board<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.079> flat<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that means the board will be flat and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
that means the board will be flat and
it'll<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.159> catch<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.180> illumise<00:01:39.659> for

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it'll just catch the illumise for

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.749 
it'll just catch the illumise for
balance<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.500> they'll<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.400> ahead<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
balance or they'll just go ahead and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
balance or they'll just go ahead and
you'll<00:01:41.880> stop<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.110> won't<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.259> able<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you'll stop then you won't be able to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.139 
you'll stop then you won't be able to
make<00:01:43.590> how<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.100> Steve's<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.970> long

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.609 
make how you're Steve's going your long
slide<00:01:45.509> another<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.170> people<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
slide another thing that people do is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
slide another thing that people do is
when<00:01:46.649> they're<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.850> might<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
when they're going they might go for the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.249 
when they're going they might go for the
slide<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.420> fall<00:01:51.420> backward<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
slide and then go fall backward and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.600 
slide and then go fall backward and
slide<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> board<00:01:53.159> goes<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
slide out and the board goes and you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.590 
slide out and the board goes and you
you're<00:01:54.030> screwed

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you're screwed

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
you're screwed
you<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> want

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you do not want to do that if you want

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
you do not want to do that if you want
to<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.670> weight<00:01:56.820> distributed<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.840> so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
to have your weight distributed right so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.899 
to have your weight distributed right so
that<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.320> don't<00:01:58.610> fall<00:01:59.610> backward

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
that you don't fall backward

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.480 
that you don't fall backward
is<00:02:01.179> your<00:02:01.359> board<00:02:01.920> another<00:02:02.920> problem<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.369> may

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
is your board another problem you may

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.429 
is your board another problem you may
have<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:04.179> flat<00:02:04.719> spotting<00:02:05.079> your<00:02:05.170> wheels

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
have is flat spotting your wheels

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.230 
have is flat spotting your wheels
they're<00:02:06.100> just<00:02:06.280> wearing<00:02:06.460> them<00:02:06.789> really<00:02:07.030> badly

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
they're just wearing them really badly

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.400 
they're just wearing them really badly
and<00:02:07.569> messing<00:02:07.869> them<00:02:07.990> up

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and messing them up

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.680 
and messing them up
one<00:02:09.190> thing<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.399> can<00:02:09.759> lead<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:09.970> flat<00:02:10.239> spots<00:02:10.509> is

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
one thing that can lead to flat spots is

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.720 
one thing that can lead to flat spots is
if<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.899> really<00:02:11.170> dig<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.620> your<00:02:12.280> back<00:02:12.459> wheels

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
if you really dig in your back wheels

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.520 
if you really dig in your back wheels
and<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.120> lean<00:02:13.420> back<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:14.049> pull<00:02:14.440> your

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and just lean back and just pull your

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.680 
and just lean back and just pull your
weight<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:14.860> your<00:02:14.950> heels<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.450> keeps

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
weight on your heels is that just keeps

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.660 
weight on your heels is that just keeps
the<00:02:16.840> wheels<00:02:17.019> in<00:02:17.170> one<00:02:17.349> spot<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.099> just<00:02:18.280> wears

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the wheels in one spot and it just wears

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.770 
the wheels in one spot and it just wears
them<00:02:18.819> down<00:02:18.940> right<00:02:19.120> there<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.420> you're<00:02:19.540> not

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
them down right there and you're not

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.160 
them down right there and you're not
happy<00:02:20.549> another<00:02:21.549> way<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> prevent<00:02:22.450> flat<00:02:22.870> spots

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
happy another way to prevent flat spots

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.100 
happy another way to prevent flat spots
is<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.560> keep<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.860> board<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.540> little<00:02:25.540> tiny<00:02:25.870> bit

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
is to keep the board a little tiny bit

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.210 
is to keep the board a little tiny bit
diagonal<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.739> wheels<00:02:26.920> are<00:02:27.069> still

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
diagonal so the wheels are still

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.680 
diagonal so the wheels are still
spinning<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:29.500> also<00:02:29.650> helps<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:31.510> your

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
spinning it also helps to have your

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.000 
spinning it also helps to have your
trucks<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.959> little<00:02:32.170> looser<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.799> there's<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
trucks a little looser so there's the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.229 
trucks a little looser so there's the
truck<00:02:33.220> some<00:02:33.370> more<00:02:33.489> turn<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.209> a

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
truck some more turn so that you have a

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.490 
truck some more turn so that you have a
little<00:02:34.629> bit<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.750> rotation<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.319> wheels

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
little bit of rotation in the wheels

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.509 
little bit of rotation in the wheels
because<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.799> will<00:02:35.890> keep<00:02:35.980> your<00:02:36.099> blood<00:02:36.280> spots

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
because that will keep your blood spots

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.910 
because that will keep your blood spots
away<00:02:36.610> Oh
