00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
interesting part about the more

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.720 
interesting part about the more
interesting<00:00:58.649> part<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.039> whole<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
interesting part what whole thing is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
interesting part what whole thing is
that<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.539> also<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.840> control<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> beam<00:01:01.620> via

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
that we also can control the beam via

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.459 
that we also can control the beam via
radio<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> let's<00:01:03.300> try<00:01:03.480> this

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
radio so let's try this

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.590 
radio so let's try this
it's<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.039> program<00:01:06.219> now<00:01:06.850> we're<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.179> tape<00:01:07.390> mode

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
it's the program now we're in tape mode

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.260 
it's the program now we're in tape mode
because<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.710> sound<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.130> coming<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.060> tip

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
because the sound is coming to the tip

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:31.190 
because the sound is coming to the tip
to<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.409> radio<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.420> we<00:01:13.450> go<00:01:13.659> into<00:01:13.869> radio<00:01:13.990> mode

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:47.010 

you<00:01:32.200> can<00:01:32.349> also<00:01:32.469> control<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:32.890> CD<00:01:33.759> changer<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
you can also control the CD changer so

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.880 
you can also control the CD changer so
it's<00:01:47.110> pretty<00:01:47.229> interesting<00:01:47.530> because<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:49.360> can

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it's pretty interesting because we can

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.089 
it's pretty interesting because we can
do<00:01:50.890> more<00:01:51.039> stuff<00:01:51.369> than<00:01:51.549> just<00:01:51.849> a<00:01:52.179> computer<00:01:53.759> so

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
do more stuff than just a computer so

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.419 
do more stuff than just a computer so
okay<00:01:57.099> let's<00:01:57.310> go<00:01:57.429> back<00:01:57.609> to<00:01:57.879> computer<00:01:59.369> this<00:02:00.369> is

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429
