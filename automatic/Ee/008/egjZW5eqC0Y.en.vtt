what I'm going to talk about is like
some<00:00:55.829> basics<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.550> organics<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
some basics about organics like I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.840 
some basics about organics like I
started<00:00:59.280> flying<00:00:59.940> something<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
started flying something like that and

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.050 
started flying something like that and
yeah<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.149> basically<00:01:04.040> what<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.189> need<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
yeah so basically what you need is a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
yeah so basically what you need is a
server<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:07.070> voxel<00:01:08.070> sniper<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.640> my

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
server with voxel sniper for my

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.289 
server with voxel sniper for my
technique<00:01:09.770> i'm<00:01:10.770> using<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> table<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.030> server

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
technique i'm using the table and server

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.640 
technique i'm using the table and server
you<00:01:13.140> may<00:01:13.170> not've<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.650> yeah

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you may not've and actually do and yeah

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.770 
you may not've and actually do and yeah
so<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> snap<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so we have the snap on there and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
so we have the snap on there and
quite<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> good<00:01:19.409> server<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.100> shouldn't<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.939> any

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
quite a good server so shouldn't be any

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.429 
quite a good server so shouldn't be any
problem<00:01:21.570> making<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.150> yeah<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.420> let's<00:01:24.810> get

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
problem making it and yeah so let's get

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.469 
problem making it and yeah so let's get
started<00:01:25.650> haha<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:28.170> need<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:30.090> basically

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
started haha so we need so basically

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.350 
started haha so we need so basically
there<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.810> two<00:01:31.130> types<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.430> making<00:01:32.850> organics

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
there are two types of making organics

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.749 
there are two types of making organics
one<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.140> make<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> wire<00:01:35.400> frame

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
one is to make like a wire frame

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.450 
one is to make like a wire frame
building<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.990> whole<00:01:37.140> thing<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.860> rough

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
building up the whole thing very rough

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.630 
building up the whole thing very rough
and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:39.000> fill<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.689> behind<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:41.100> 1<00:01:41.310> i'm

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and then fill it in behind the 1 i'm

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.830 
and then fill it in behind the 1 i'm
doing<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.600> 21<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.759> Morris<00:01:45.240> wake

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
doing in 21 I'm really like Morris wake

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.490 
doing in 21 I'm really like Morris wake
making<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.560> buckle<00:01:47.009> snapper<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
making it with buckle snapper and

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.770 
making it with buckle snapper and
basically<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:50.009> doing<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.780> let's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
grab a bull block I'm using some

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.950 
grab a bull block I'm using some
commands<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.009> basically<00:01:56.969> first<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.479> all<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
commands so basically first of all to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
like only the lines how the body is

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.529 
like only the lines how the body is
going<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> case<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:09.239> already

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
going and in this case there's already

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
going and in this case there's already
the<00:02:09.840> first<00:02:10.170> command<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the first command I'm you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.020 
the first command I'm you
it's<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.640> voxel<00:02:13.360> slappa<00:02:13.870> line<00:02:14.380> brush<00:02:14.910> come<00:02:15.910> on

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it's the voxel slappa line brush come on

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.290 
it's the voxel slappa line brush come on
this<00:02:17.070> /b<00:02:18.780> space<00:02:19.780> l<00:02:20.260> or<00:02:20.680> space<00:02:21.670> line<00:02:21.970> doesn't

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
this /b space l or space line doesn't

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.500 
this /b space l or space line doesn't
matter<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.980> then<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.370> first<00:02:24.880> right<00:02:25.180> click<00:02:25.210> on

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
matter and then you first right click on

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.170 
matter and then you first right click on
your<00:02:25.570> first<00:02:25.870> point<00:02:26.370> first<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.520> have<00:02:27.640> box

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
your first point first you have box

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.210 
your first point first you have box
let's<00:02:28.420> already<00:02:28.720> set<00:02:28.870> them<00:02:29.080> with<00:02:29.500> for<00:02:29.830> me<00:02:29.950> it's

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
let's already set them with for me it's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.480 
let's already set them with for me it's
grass<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.330> I'd<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:31.990> have<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.410> wool<00:02:32.860> so

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
grass but I'd like to do have it wool so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.780 
grass but I'd like to do have it wool so
you<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.750> your<00:02:34.900> first<00:02:35.140> point<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.890> down<00:02:36.610> with

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
you do your first point and down with

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.190 
you do your first point and down with
the<00:02:36.820> camper<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> second<00:02:37.780> point<00:02:37.900> would

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the camper a second point would

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.860 
the camper a second point would
automatically<00:02:38.740> create<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.430> line<00:02:39.780> which<00:02:40.780> is

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
automatically create a line which is

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.430 
automatically create a line which is
quite<00:02:41.230> useful<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.890> some<00:02:42.070> stuff<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
quite useful for some stuff and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.070 
quite useful for some stuff and
basically<00:02:44.440> I'm<00:02:45.310> building<00:02:46.210> up<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.690> whole

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
basically I'm building up the whole

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.410 
basically I'm building up the whole
thing<00:02:47.350> first<00:02:47.770> really<00:02:48.670> really<00:02:48.880> rough<00:02:49.120> with

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
thing first really really rough with

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.290 
thing first really really rough with
those<00:02:49.600> lines<00:02:49.870> making<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.100> general<00:02:52.060> shape<00:02:52.090> of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
those lines making the general shape of

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.130 
those lines making the general shape of
2<00:02:52.570> pi<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.080> then<00:02:53.350> I'll<00:02:54.340> start<00:02:54.820> making<00:02:55.810> it

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
2 pi and then I'll start making it

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.160 
2 pi and then I'll start making it
bigger<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.310> case<00:02:57.640> I'm<00:02:57.880> using<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.570> using

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
bigger for this case I'm using the using

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.580 
bigger for this case I'm using the using
some<00:02:59.440> brushes<00:02:59.680> like<00:03:00.070> first<00:03:00.580> form<00:03:00.820> using<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
some brushes like first form using the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.220 
some brushes like first form using the
plant<00:03:02.590> ball<00:03:02.860> brush<00:03:03.220> /<00:03:03.910> b<00:03:04.330> space<00:03:05.050> space<00:03:05.770> BB<00:03:07.230> what

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
plant ball brush / b space space BB what

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.520 
plant ball brush / b space space BB what
this<00:03:08.440> brush<00:03:08.800> does<00:03:09.450> turn<00:03:10.450> down<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.020> sauce<00:03:11.230> is

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
this brush does turn down the sauce is

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.630 
this brush does turn down the sauce is
if<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.220> right<00:03:12.700> click<00:03:12.730> with<00:03:13.150> my<00:03:13.360> gun<00:03:13.690> powder<00:03:14.640> make

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
if I right click with my gun powder make

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640 
if I right click with my gun powder make
things<00:03:16.030> way<00:03:16.810> bigger<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.890> like<00:03:19.650> decide

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
things way bigger so I can like decide

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.100 
things way bigger so I can like decide
how<00:03:20.830> big<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.220> thing<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.520> going<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.150> with<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
how big the thing is going and with the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.650 
how big the thing is going and with the
arrow<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.500> can<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:24.250> smooth<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.850> out<00:03:27.209> yo<00:03:28.209> so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
arrow I can like smooth it out yo so

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.330 
arrow I can like smooth it out yo so
this<00:03:29.260> is<00:03:29.410> basically<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.950> first<00:03:30.310> brush<00:03:31.320> for

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
this is basically the first brush for

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.770 
this is basically the first brush for
making<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.670> like<00:03:34.330> 3d<00:03:36.480> basically<00:03:37.480> i'm<00:03:37.570> also

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
making it like 3d basically i'm also

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.980 
making it like 3d basically i'm also
using<00:03:38.070> second<00:03:39.070> brush<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:39.459> called<00:03:39.990> mouth

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
using second brush it's called mouth

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.520 
using second brush it's called mouth
brush<00:03:41.440> base<00:03:42.040> page<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.790> space<00:03:44.520> melt<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:46.690> so

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
brush base page a space melt here so

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.110 
brush base page a space melt here so
what<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:48.280> brush<00:03:48.640> does<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:50.250> melt<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.790> blocks

what this brush does is melt the blocks
or<00:03:52.510> fill<00:03:53.260> them<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.490> quite<00:03:55.060> useful<00:03:55.180> for

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
or fill them in this is quite useful for

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.970 
or fill them in this is quite useful for
a<00:03:55.660> small<00:03:55.959> detail<00:03:57.810> basically<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.830> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
a small detail basically this is the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.050 
a small detail basically this is the
brush<00:04:00.250> I'll<00:04:01.150> give<00:04:01.950> thing<00:04:02.950> most<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.490> time

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
maybe we're in comparison with the plan

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
texture pack but in this case I'm using

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.960 
texture pack but in this case I'm using
our<00:04:45.900> table<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.259> texture<00:04:46.740> pack<00:04:46.949> and<00:04:47.250> the

our table and texture pack and the
reason<00:04:48.240> for<00:04:48.270> this<00:04:48.539> we<00:04:48.840> use<00:04:48.870> kind<00:04:49.289> of<00:04:49.380> some<00:04:49.740> days

you<00:04:53.210> nasiruddin<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.419> warp<00:04:55.610> basically<00:04:56.610> what's

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
you nasiruddin to warp basically what's

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.560 
you nasiruddin to warp basically what's
up<00:04:57.270> bodies<00:04:57.630> are<00:04:57.870> it's<00:04:58.199> a<00:04:58.470> feature<00:04:59.280> of<00:04:59.570> MC

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
up bodies are it's a feature of MC

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
up bodies are it's a feature of MC
pattern<00:05:01.080> up<00:05:01.350> define<00:05:01.770> connected<00:05:02.520> textures<00:05:03.030> and

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
pattern up define connected textures and

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.270 
pattern up define connected textures and
what<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.680> does<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.100> can<00:05:05.840> put<00:05:06.840> several

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
what it does you can put several

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.750 
what it does you can put several
different<00:05:08.280> textures<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:09.240> one<00:05:10.229> main<00:05:11.039> text<00:05:11.400> like

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
different textures to one main text like

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.719 
different textures to one main text like
for<00:05:11.940> example<00:05:12.030> here<00:05:12.539> if<00:05:12.630> close<00:05:12.900> down<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:13.729> close

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
for example here if close down and close

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.430 
for example here if close down and close
them<00:05:15.090> with<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.599> suppity<00:05:15.960> five<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:16.949> I<00:05:18.440> feel

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
them with the suppity five so I feel

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:27.560 
them with the suppity five so I feel
like<00:05:19.560> up<00:05:19.770> close<00:05:19.830> stone<00:05:20.639> is<00:05:23.000> 89<00:05:24.000> 89<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:26.570> for

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
like up close stone is 89 89 I for

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.390 
like up close stone is 89 89 I for
example<00:05:27.599> if<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.990> place<00:05:28.199> a<00:05:28.229> block<00:05:28.500> dear<00:05:28.710> there

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
example if I place a block dear there

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:39.020 
example if I place a block dear there
and<00:05:29.669> just<00:05:30.979> replace<00:05:31.979> it<00:05:32.130> with<00:05:36.349> acids<00:05:37.349> 89<00:05:38.220> just

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
and just replace it with acids 89 just

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.850 
and just replace it with acids 89 just
the<00:05:39.210> glass<00:05:39.389> Stone<00:05:39.599> but<00:05:40.080> if<00:05:40.229> i<00:05:40.380> SAT<00:05:40.740> 89<00:05:42.740> with<00:05:43.740> the

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
the glass Stone but if i SAT 89 with the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.060 
the glass Stone but if i SAT 89 with the
SAP<00:05:44.070> 85<00:05:44.610> that<00:05:45.360> looks<00:05:45.659> like<00:05:45.960> this<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:47.010> is

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
SAP 85 that looks like this and this is

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.649 
SAP 85 that looks like this and this is
only<00:05:47.280> if<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.580> have<00:05:47.760> these<00:05:48.800> saturdays<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.659> the

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
only if you have these saturdays and the

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.570 
only if you have these saturdays and the
awesome<00:05:51.840> thing<00:05:52.229> about<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.740> is<00:05:52.800> that<00:05:53.250> you

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
awesome thing about that is that you

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.760 
awesome thing about that is that you
really<00:05:53.909> can<00:05:54.180> create<00:05:54.570> a<00:05:54.750> lot<00:05:54.780> of<00:05:55.080> plug<00:05:55.470> so<00:05:55.650> we

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
really can create a lot of plug so we

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.560 
really can create a lot of plug so we
have<00:05:55.919> like<00:05:56.130> seven<00:05:56.699> hundred<00:05:56.729> and<00:05:57.090> forty

have like seven hundred and forty
different<00:05:57.810> blocks<00:05:58.409> just<00:05:59.340> because<00:05:59.639> of<00:05:59.760> their

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
different blocks just because of their

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.719 
different blocks just because of their
seventies<00:06:00.449> I'm<00:06:01.440> really<00:06:01.889> going<00:06:02.159> to<00:06:02.250> use<00:06:02.520> this

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
texture pack but i'll use because i have

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.250 
texture pack but i'll use because i have
really<00:06:08.729> a<00:06:08.760> lot<00:06:09.030> of<00:06:09.180> possibilities<00:06:09.570> with<00:06:10.080> all
