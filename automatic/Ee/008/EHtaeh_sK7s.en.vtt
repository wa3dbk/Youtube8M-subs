00:00:29.619 --> 00:01:03.649
 we divide the area so that the heat is not lit 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:01:06.460
 more possible light distance between 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.550
 seedlings taken equal to three meters 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.910
 but it is possible and less but it is better to plant 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.280
 so that each bush more 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.800
 battered the view so I place not 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.800
 saved between the rows took 3 meters 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.380
 I also have a distance between bushes 3 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.299
 meters between passengers 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:39.290
 bushes for planting using planting 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:42.020
 pit in order for the roots to give food 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.530
 here are the judges let 's say on our ground 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:53.659
 we like about 40 centimeters 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.159
 is the horizon of the fertile land 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.259
 next comes the red clay 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.000
 if we just plant grapes that is 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.500
 our roots will be in this 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.320
 the lesson 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.610
 the essence of the clay take something nutritious 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.679
 they are not possible so we dig 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.930
 pit 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:18.280
 80 for 80 I dig and depth 90 can 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.740
 meters to dig quietly this pit that for 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.050
 this will need further to the bottom of the pit 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:38.190
 where we pour our brick that is all that 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:38.190
 there is gravel sand 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.740
 go up the road now 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.569
 after rubble we fall asleep 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.480
 filled the cart with humus 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:18.060
 Now I take away the room and add 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:22.049
 you can add a whole bucket spilling out 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.690
 a second cart manure humus here 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.860
 can not be here necessarily 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:35.340
 good land but as 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:47.459
 land using so we have leveled 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:51.049
 and ram fall asleep on top of the ground 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.079
 which was taken out of the top layer 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:58.500
 the clay that was down I her 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:01.940
 leveled plot throw for 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.940
 uni using 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:45.680
 I did not leave the previous ones I could not leave there 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.199
 polyethylene pipe which is placed on 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.190
 gravel 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.660
 here it is necessary for something that is possible 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.650
 right away 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:05.840
 the roots pour a bucket of water and pour out and 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:14.289
 close the lid now doing we get 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:14.289
 our seedling is already overgrown with me 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:23.979
 gently pull in with a bucket 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.979
 water 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.030
 bushwoman 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:56.250
 we get our seedling straighten 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.870
 neat language understand 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.870
 our land 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.639
 what 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.770
 throw in advance 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:07.850
 landing should be below the kidney of 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:16.700
 whose first escape was given a centimeter on 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:20.200
 2 primer still earrings we picked it up good luck
