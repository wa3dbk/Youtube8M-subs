00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
by that is unless the internet goes out

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.700 
by that is unless the internet goes out
of<00:02:13.020> business

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
of business

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.580 
of business
this<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.340> same<00:02:14.580> place<00:02:14.820> where<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.720> Library

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
this is the same place where the Library

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.160 
this is the same place where the Library
of<00:02:16.650> Congress<00:02:17.250> keeps<00:02:17.640> their<00:02:18.240> data<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
of Congress keeps their data this is a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
of Congress keeps their data this is a
large<00:02:19.740> database<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.330> has<00:02:21.780> no<00:02:22.290> relevance<00:02:22.920> to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
large database that has no relevance to

large database that has no relevance to
the<00:02:23.400> company<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.240> buy<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:25.110> particular

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the company that you buy this particular

the company that you buy this particular
technology<00:02:26.130> through<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.670> think<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.360> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
technology through so I think it is a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.680 
technology through so I think it is a
great<00:02:31.560> addition<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.940> fraction<00:02:33.570> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
great addition and it's a fraction of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.510 
great addition and it's a fraction of
the<00:02:33.750> cost<00:02:34.020> if<00:02:34.380> you're<00:02:34.680> looking<00:02:34.980> at<00:02:35.100> buying<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
the cost if you're looking at buying a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.240 
the cost if you're looking at buying a
gravestone<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.990> probably<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> five<00:02:37.830> percent

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
gravestone it's probably a five percent

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.750 
gravestone it's probably a five percent
increase<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.030> overall<00:02:39.450> price<00:02:40.100> but<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:41.400> you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
increase in the overall price but if you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.700 
increase in the overall price but if you
really<00:02:42.000> want<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.420> know<00:02:42.480> somebody<00:02:43.200> see
