okay<00:00:05.710> well<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:07.029> is<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:07.479> pin<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:09.130> a<00:00:09.400> bulldozer

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
okay well that is a pin of a bulldozer

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.390 
okay well that is a pin of a bulldozer
it's<00:00:10.929> three<00:00:11.260> inches<00:00:11.410> in<00:00:11.740> diameter<00:00:11.920> it's

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
it's three inches in diameter it's

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.790 
it's three inches in diameter it's
hardened<00:00:12.820> steel<00:00:13.120> and<00:00:14.340> my<00:00:15.340> intent<00:00:15.850> is<00:00:16.119> to<00:00:16.800> turn

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
hardened steel and my intent is to turn

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.140 
hardened steel and my intent is to turn
this<00:00:18.010> into<00:00:18.070> a<00:00:18.400> tapered<00:00:19.529> point<00:00:20.909> for<00:00:21.909> a<00:00:21.939> bail

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
this into a tapered point for a bail

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.800 
this into a tapered point for a bail
sphere<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:24.150> I'm<00:00:25.150> hoping<00:00:25.449> it's<00:00:25.630> long<00:00:25.779> enough

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
sphere and I'm hoping it's long enough

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.179 
sphere and I'm hoping it's long enough
that<00:00:26.319> I<00:00:26.380> can<00:00:26.650> also<00:00:28.169> taper<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:29.439> other<00:00:29.560> end<00:00:29.859> and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
that I can also taper the other end and

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.360 
that I can also taper the other end and
put<00:00:30.999> threads<00:00:31.329> on<00:00:31.569> it<00:00:31.829> to<00:00:32.829> make<00:00:32.980> one<00:00:33.160> of<00:00:33.250> those

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
put threads on it to make one of those

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:44.790 
put threads on it to make one of those
screw<00:00:34.239> type<00:00:34.540> wood<00:00:35.290> splitters<00:00:36.690> well<00:00:43.800> again

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
screw type wood splitters well again

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.510 
screw type wood splitters well again
this<00:00:44.920> is<00:00:44.980> hardened<00:00:45.460> steel<00:00:45.699> it's<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:47.160> bulldozer

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700 
my pieces and now I'm gonna they're all
cut<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:25.030> size<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.540> I'll<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:25.869> ease<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
cut to size so I'll just ease the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.399 
cut to size so I'll just ease the
corners<00:01:27.340> on<00:01:27.490> them<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:27.850> they're<00:01:27.970> all<00:01:28.200> nice<00:01:29.200> to

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
corners on them so they're all nice to

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.090 
corners on them so they're all nice to
work<00:01:29.530> with<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:31.690> I'll<00:01:31.810> serve<00:01:32.020> them<00:01:32.440> together

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
okay well here's some of my parts I'm

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.219 
okay well here's some of my parts I'm
just<00:01:40.210> laying<00:01:40.450> out<00:01:40.720> for<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.770> locations<00:01:42.369> of<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
just laying out for the locations of the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.160 
just laying out for the locations of the
different<00:01:44.560> bits<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.590> down<00:01:47.830> here<00:01:49.170> I've

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
different bits and then down here I've

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.249 
different bits and then down here I've
made<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.410> jig

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
made a jig

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.440 
made a jig
so<00:01:53.259> if<00:01:53.410> laid<00:01:53.649> out<00:01:53.800> lines<00:01:54.070> for<00:01:54.430> where<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.090> lower

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
so if laid out lines for where the lower

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.300 
so if laid out lines for where the lower
pins<00:01:56.020> are<00:01:56.289> gonna<00:01:56.440> go<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:57.970> made<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.180> jig<00:01:58.570> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
pins are gonna go and I made a jig and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.999 
pins are gonna go and I made a jig and
you<00:02:00.310> line<00:02:00.580> up<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.840> lines<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.410> jig<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.679> Jake

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
you line up the lines in the jig to Jake

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.630 
you line up the lines in the jig to Jake
the<00:02:03.399> hole<00:02:03.580> in<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.820> jig<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:05.190> one<00:02:06.190> inch<00:02:06.369> bigger

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
the hole in the jig is one inch bigger

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.370 
the hole in the jig is one inch bigger
than<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.030> actual<00:02:07.539> pipe<00:02:07.780> that's<00:02:07.990> gonna<00:02:08.140> go<00:02:08.259> in

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
than the actual pipe that's gonna go in

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.500 
than the actual pipe that's gonna go in
there<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:11.100> one<00:02:12.100> inch<00:02:12.510> plasma

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
there and so that the one inch plasma

00:02:13.510 --> 00:03:04.390 
there and so that the one inch plasma
cutter<00:02:14.100> cuts<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.310> right<00:02:15.459> sized<00:02:15.700> hole

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
together and I've ground out all the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.649 
together and I've ground out all the
places<00:03:11.700> where<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.269> gonna<00:03:12.620> attach<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.510> that

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
places where it's gonna attach so that

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:22.599 
places where it's gonna attach so that
I'll<00:03:15.780> get<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.959> nice<00:03:16.169> clean<00:03:16.500> weld<00:03:17.569> in<00:03:18.569> every<00:03:18.840> case

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.209 

okay<00:03:23.609> well<00:03:23.879> that's<00:03:24.659> my<00:03:24.810> bail<00:03:25.019> spirit<00:03:25.500> it's<00:03:26.040> uh

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.219 
okay well that's my bail spirit it's uh

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.709 
okay well that's my bail spirit it's uh
done<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.359> not<00:03:27.449> painted<00:03:27.870> yet<00:03:28.049> but<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.290> will<00:03:28.439> be

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:29.719 
done it's not painted yet but it will be

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.399 
done it's not painted yet but it will be
the<00:03:30.719> two<00:03:30.959> bottom<00:03:31.609> stabilizing<00:03:33.230> spears<00:03:34.230> I

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
the two bottom stabilizing spears I

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.240 
the two bottom stabilizing spears I
suppose<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.189> large<00:03:35.969> main<00:03:36.269> spear<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:38.069> main

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
suppose and a large main spear the main

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.890 
suppose and a large main spear the main
spear<00:03:38.519> might<00:03:38.699> be<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.849> little<00:03:38.969> bit<00:03:39.180> too<00:03:39.419> big<00:03:39.689> it's

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
spear might be a little bit too big it's

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.439 
spear might be a little bit too big it's
two<00:03:40.109> and<00:03:40.139> three<00:03:40.409> eighths<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.829> diameter<00:03:41.419> so<00:03:42.419> I

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
two and three eighths in diameter so I

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.759 
two and three eighths in diameter so I
don't<00:03:42.780> know<00:03:42.870> if<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.139> gonna<00:03:43.260> work<00:03:43.530> or<00:03:43.739> not

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
don't know if that's gonna work or not

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.459 
don't know if that's gonna work or not
but<00:03:44.209> anyway<00:03:45.209> he's<00:03:45.329> got<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> solid<00:03:45.719> point<00:03:46.109> on<00:03:46.319> it

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:46.469 
but anyway he's got a solid point on it

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.089 
but anyway he's got a solid point on it
but<00:03:47.159> it<00:03:47.280> turned<00:03:47.549> from<00:03:47.669> hardened<00:03:48.269> steel<00:03:48.510> and

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
but it turned from hardened steel and

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.089 
but it turned from hardened steel and
the<00:03:50.099> pipe<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:52.260> Tim<00:03:52.469> three-eighths<00:03:52.829> pipe

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
the pipe it's the Tim three-eighths pipe

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.210 
the pipe it's the Tim three-eighths pipe
outside<00:03:53.310> diameter<00:03:53.669> is<00:03:54.439> very<00:03:55.439> very<00:03:55.709> thick<00:03:56.009> wall

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
