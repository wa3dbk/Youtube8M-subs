ridden by someone or simply being
unmanned<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.599> tracks<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.710> idiot<00:00:29.130> plays

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
unmanned on tracks so what idiot plays

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.640 
unmanned on tracks so what idiot plays
the<00:00:29.699> pressure<00:00:29.970> plate<00:00:30.240> estan<00:00:31.199> pressure<00:00:31.410> plate

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
the pressure plate estan pressure plate
in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> wooden<00:00:32.640> pressure<00:00:32.850> plate<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.510> make

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
in the wooden pressure plate to make

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.290 
in the wooden pressure plate to make
sounds<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> did<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.149> upgraded<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
sounds so what I did is upgraded and

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.040 
sounds so what I did is upgraded and
made<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.870> tracks<00:00:40.860> change<00:00:41.370> based<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.629> whether

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
made the tracks change based on whether

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.069 
made the tracks change based on whether
there<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.649> whether<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.969> cart<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.600> manned<00:00:45.840> or

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
there is whether the cart is manned or

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.319 
there is whether the cart is manned or
not<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.370> cart<00:00:47.579> isn't<00:00:47.850> man<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.180> will

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
not so the cart isn't man what will

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.189 
not so the cart isn't man what will
happen<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:50.010> couple<00:00:50.489> fall<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> will<00:00:51.870> go

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
happen the couple fall and will go

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.850 
happen the couple fall and will go
wherever<00:00:53.539> basically<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> use<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
wherever basically you can use it to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.569 
wherever basically you can use it to
refill<00:00:56.340> your<00:00:56.840> pez<00:00:57.840> dispenser<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.890> whatever

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
refill your pez dispenser or whatever

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.389 
refill your pez dispenser or whatever
you<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.350> if<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.590> meant<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.190> will

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you want to if it's meant what will

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.170 
you want to if it's meant what will
happen<00:01:02.730> I'll<00:01:03.120> fall<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.880> because<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
happen I'll fall and because of the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.350 
happen I'll fall and because of the
latest<00:01:06.540> update<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.140> 1.9<00:01:07.650> pre-release<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
latest update in 1.9 pre-release to the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.820 
latest update in 1.9 pre-release to the
hitboxes<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:11.479> offences<00:01:12.479> change<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.939> you<00:01:14.939> can

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
hitboxes for offences change so you can

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
hitboxes for offences change so you can
get<00:01:16.830> stuck<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.670> fence<00:01:18.119> fall<00:01:18.630> down<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.200> then

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
get stuck in a fence fall down and then

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.520 
get stuck in a fence fall down and then
you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.680> press<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.280> pressure<00:01:20.729> plate<00:01:21.530> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you can press the pressure plate so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.359 
you can press the pressure plate so
whenever<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:24.140> fall<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.890> redstone

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
whenever I fall down the redstone

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.480 
whenever I fall down the redstone
circuit<00:01:26.729> opinion<00:01:27.770> pressing<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.040> pressure

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
circuit opinion pressing that pressure

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.719 
circuit opinion pressing that pressure
plate<00:01:29.790> will<00:01:30.060> start<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.570> circuit<00:01:31.340> causing<00:01:32.340> these

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
plate will start a circuit causing these

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
plate will start a circuit causing these
two<00:01:33.439> Pistons<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.650> push<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.189> stone<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:37.350> rail

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
two Pistons to push a stone and a rail

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
two Pistons to push a stone and a rail
each<00:01:39.140> pushing<00:01:40.140> his<00:01:40.590> own<00:01:40.920> thing<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:42.110> under

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
each pushing his own thing and under

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.010 
each pushing his own thing and under
that<00:01:43.380> track<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.220> three<00:01:44.579> features<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.689> on

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that track I have three features put on

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.039 
that track I have three features put on
maximum<00:01:46.649> delay<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.360> another<00:01:48.360> 2<00:01:48.630> repeaters

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
maximum delay and another 2 repeaters

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.990 
maximum delay and another 2 repeaters
near<00:01:49.470> each<00:01:50.119> piston<00:01:51.119> again<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.990> maximum<00:01:52.500> delay

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
near each piston again on maximum delay

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.260 
near each piston again on maximum delay
so<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.329> happens<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.829> I'll<00:01:56.040> replace<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so what happens is if I'll replace that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
so what happens is if I'll replace that
wooden<00:01:57.810> plate<00:01:58.020> let's<00:01:58.590> template<00:01:59.130> with

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
wooden plate let's template with

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
wooden plate let's template with
wouldn't<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.320> now<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.649> using

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
wouldn't I can see now that I'm using

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.520 
wouldn't I can see now that I'm using
wooden<00:02:02.219> pressure<00:02:02.640> plate<00:02:02.969> every<00:02:03.899> card<00:02:04.170> also

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
wooden pressure plate every card also

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
wooden pressure plate every card also
onion<00:02:05.159> card<00:02:05.460> will<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:05.790> figure<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
onion card will also figure the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.410 
onion card will also figure the
then<00:02:08.619> redstone<00:02:09.160> circuit<00:02:09.369> she<00:02:09.700> obviously<00:02:09.970> so

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
then redstone circuit she obviously so

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.930 
then redstone circuit she obviously so
burned<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.050> mind<00:02:11.260> what<00:02:11.709> happens<00:02:12.069> is<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
burned it in mind what happens is the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.229 
burned it in mind what happens is the
car<00:02:13.209> drops<00:02:13.590> make<00:02:14.590> these<00:02:15.099> two<00:02:15.310> pistols<00:02:15.730> push

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
car drops make these two pistols push

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.160 
car drops make these two pistols push
the<00:02:16.690> blocks<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.300> cart<00:02:19.540> goes<00:02:19.930> that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the blocks and then the cart goes that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.870 
the blocks and then the cart goes that
way<00:02:20.380> instead<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:20.860> way<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.430> because<00:02:21.760> of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
way instead of that way and because of

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.170 
way instead of that way and because of
the<00:02:21.970> delay<00:02:22.120> under<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.989> bridge<00:02:23.260> after<00:02:24.180> some

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
the delay under that bridge after some

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.050 
the delay under that bridge after some
time<00:02:25.450> when<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.870> card<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.350> moved<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.069> these<00:02:27.880> two

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
time when the card is moved on these two

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.780 
time when the card is moved on these two
Pistons<00:02:28.450> push<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.780> again<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.370> default

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
Pistons push it again so the default
