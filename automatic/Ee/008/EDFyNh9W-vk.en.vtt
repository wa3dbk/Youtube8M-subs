you would do is you would type / let me
fly<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:18.170> he<00:00:19.170> had<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.500> turned<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.189> he<00:00:20.400> he<00:00:21.119> was

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
fly and he had it turned on so he he was

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.240 
fly and he had it turned on so he he was
breaking<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.720> block<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.050> flew<00:00:22.230> away<00:00:22.289> basically

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
breaking a block and flew away basically

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.790 
breaking a block and flew away basically
what<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.170> you<00:00:25.170> would<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.500> click<00:00:25.529> on

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
what you do is you would right click on

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.939 
what you do is you would right click on
any<00:00:25.980> block<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> ground<00:00:27.650> this<00:00:28.650> by<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> way

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
any block on the ground this by the way

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.290 
any block on the ground this by the way
this<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> Peter<00:00:29.670> he's<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.240> who

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
this is Peter he's the one who

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.600 
this is Peter he's the one who
programmed<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.869> mod<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.279> would<00:00:32.399> tell

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
programmed this mod and it would tell

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.250 
programmed this mod and it would tell
you<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.300> believe<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.870> fly

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you that you believe that you can fly

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.580 
you that you believe that you can fly
and<00:00:35.390> basically<00:00:36.390> doing<00:00:36.870> any<00:00:37.079> motion<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and basically doing any motion that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.880 
and basically doing any motion that
swings<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.100> arm<00:00:39.140> such<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.320> left<00:00:40.590> clicking

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
swings your arm such as left clicking

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.310 
swings your arm such as left clicking
would<00:00:41.820> cause<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> take<00:00:42.570> off<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> fly<00:00:42.989> up

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
would cause you to take off and fly up

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.119 
would cause you to take off and fly up
into<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> air<00:00:45.170> what's<00:00:46.170> nice<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.860> mod

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
into the air what's nice about this mod

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.869 
into the air what's nice about this mod
is<00:00:47.160> depending<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> angle<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.690> cursor

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
is depending on the angle of your cursor

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
is depending on the angle of your cursor
be<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:51.629> straight<00:00:52.230> off<00:00:52.350> into

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
be it up or down or straight off into

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.970 
be it up or down or straight off into
the<00:00:52.710> horizon<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:54.090> would<00:00:54.559> your<00:00:55.559> angle<00:00:55.860> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the horizon you would your angle of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
the horizon you would your angle of
ascent<00:00:56.100> would<00:00:56.640> increase<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.360> decrease<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
ascent would increase or decrease and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.170 
ascent would increase or decrease and
your<00:00:58.949> flight<00:00:59.280> speed<00:00:59.579> would<00:00:59.730> increase<00:01:00.030> or

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
your flight speed would increase or

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.549 
your flight speed would increase or
decrease<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:00.930> you're<00:01:01.050> pointing<00:01:01.350> more

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
decrease so when you're pointing more

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
decrease so when you're pointing more
off<00:01:01.680> into<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> horizon<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:03.539> actually<00:01:03.719> get

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
off into the horizon you actually get

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.609 
off into the horizon you actually get
more<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> forward<00:01:05.100> boost<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.689> less<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
more of a forward boost and a less of a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.230 
more of a forward boost and a less of a
nut<00:01:07.770> motion<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.700> instance<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:12.119> we

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
nut motion so like for instance if we

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.700 
nut motion so like for instance if we
wanted<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> fly<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.380> over<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
wanted to fly back it up and over this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.140 
wanted to fly back it up and over this
mountain<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.220> could<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.580> turn<00:01:14.700> around<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
mountain we could just turn around and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.210 
mountain we could just turn around and
point<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.530> would<00:01:16.650> take<00:01:16.830> us<00:01:16.979> over<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
point up and it would take us over the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
point up and it would take us over the
mountain<00:01:20.390> what's<00:01:21.390> nice<00:01:21.570> also<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> when

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
mountain what's nice also is that when

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
mountain what's nice also is that when
you<00:01:22.500> point<00:01:22.770> straight<00:01:23.189> down<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:23.939> get

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you point straight down you actually get

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.310 
you point straight down you actually get
more<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.420> upward<00:01:24.720> boost<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.200> like

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
more of an upward boost so it's like

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.749 
more of an upward boost so it's like
you're<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.860> pumping<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.280> wings<00:01:26.490> hard

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you're you're pumping your wings hard

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.690 
you're you're pumping your wings hard
work<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.420> virtual<00:01:27.840> wings<00:01:28.080> harder<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
work your your virtual wings harder a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.270 
work your your virtual wings harder a
slight<00:01:29.700> forward<00:01:30.150> tilt<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:31.619> pointing<00:01:32.070> down

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
slight forward tilt when pointing down

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.810 
slight forward tilt when pointing down
will<00:01:32.579> make<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.049> land<00:01:34.290> on

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
will make it so you can land on

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.480 
will make it so you can land on
precisely<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.210> top<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.570> objects<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.490> if

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
precisely on top of objects like so if

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.929 
precisely on top of objects like so if
you<00:01:39.450> wanted<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.280> completely<00:01:41.670> let<00:01:41.790> go

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you wanted to you can completely let go

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.109 
you wanted to you can completely let go
of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> keyboard<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.750> using<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> mod<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
of the keyboard when using this mod and

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.170 
of the keyboard when using this mod and
and<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.770> any<00:01:46.890> trouble<00:01:47.280> landing<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.729> top<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and I have any trouble landing on top of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.170 
and I have any trouble landing on top of
objects<00:01:48.840> once<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.740> use<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> feather<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:53.180> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
objects once you use the feather to to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.789 
objects once you use the feather to to
take<00:01:54.390> off<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.960> use<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> click<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
take off to use it to click on the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.590 
take off to use it to click on the
ground<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:56.850> switch<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.090> almost<00:01:57.390> any

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
ground you can then switch to almost any

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.370 
ground you can then switch to almost any
object<00:01:58.079> causes<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> swing<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.280> arm<00:01:59.610> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
object causes you to swing your arm and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.389 
object causes you to swing your arm and

you wanted to I don't know if that's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.150 
you wanted to I don't know if that's
planned<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.450> development<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> mod<00:02:28.470> but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
planned for development in the mod but

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.449 
planned for development in the mod but
you<00:02:29.730> definitely<00:02:29.940> would<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.480> able<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:30.989> it

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
you definitely would be able to do it

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.660 
you definitely would be able to do it
once<00:02:32.459> player<00:02:32.730> damage<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.300> implemented<00:02:34.670> you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
once player damage is implemented you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.970 
once player damage is implemented you
could<00:02:36.150> even<00:02:36.269> use<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.660> mod<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.170> increase<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
could even use this mod to increase the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.820 
could even use this mod to increase the
size<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.430> hitbox<00:02:39.260> for<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> player<00:02:40.560> or

increase the size of a hitbox for an

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.940

arrow<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.800> aerial<00:02:44.280> battles<00:02:45.920> with<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
arrow and have aerial battles with the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.000 
arrow and have aerial battles with the
horizontal<00:02:47.370> fly<00:02:48.150> when<00:02:48.989> facing<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.410> horizon

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
horizontal fly when facing the horizon

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.589 
horizontal fly when facing the horizon
it<00:02:50.489> allows<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:53.090> once<00:02:54.090> under<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> certain

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
it allows you to once under a certain

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.750 
it allows you to once under a certain
level<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.050> allows<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.530> basically<00:02:56.250> hit<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
level that allows you to basically hit a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.149 
level that allows you to basically hit a
cruising<00:02:57.209> altitude<00:02:57.330> where<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.470> won't<00:02:58.680> ascend

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
cruising altitude where you won't ascend

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.190 
cruising altitude where you won't ascend
any<00:02:59.340> further<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.599> you'll<00:03:00.810> stay<00:03:01.019> at<00:03:01.140> a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
any further and you'll stay at a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.110 
any further and you'll stay at a
specific<00:03:01.349> altitude<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.819> can<00:03:02.970> actually

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
specific altitude and you can actually

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.290 
specific altitude and you can actually
change<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.810> by<00:03:03.930> typing<00:03:04.110> /<00:03:04.590> cruise<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.459> then

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
change that by typing / cruise and then

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.550 
change that by typing / cruise and then
change<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:07.019> 130<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.540> doing<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.349> will

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
change it to like 130 and doing so will

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.530 
change it to like 130 and doing so will
put<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.940> above<00:03:12.440> fast<00:03:13.440> level<00:03:13.920> clouds<00:03:14.540> and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
put you just above fast level clouds and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.949 
put you just above fast level clouds and
you<00:03:15.750> would<00:03:15.900> cruise<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:18.510> makes<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you would cruise there and this makes it

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.530 
you would cruise there and this makes it
so<00:03:19.140> once<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.470> hit<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.680> specific<00:03:20.330> altitude<00:03:21.330> you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
so once you hit a specific altitude you

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.290 
so once you hit a specific altitude you
no<00:03:21.659> longer<00:03:21.840> ascend<00:03:22.489> for<00:03:23.489> each<00:03:23.610> flap<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.150> your

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
no longer ascend for each flap of your

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.020 
no longer ascend for each flap of your
wings<00:03:24.739> that's<00:03:25.739> pretty<00:03:25.980> nice<00:03:26.129> for<00:03:26.190> traveling

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
wings that's pretty nice for traveling

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.920 
wings that's pretty nice for traveling
long<00:03:27.269> distances<00:03:28.069> if<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.549> notice<00:03:29.849> I<00:03:30.390> lose<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
long distances if you notice I lose a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.960 
long distances if you notice I lose a
little<00:03:31.349> bit<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.590> frames<00:03:31.890> per<00:03:32.129> second<00:03:32.549> that's

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
little bit of frames per second that's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.490 
little bit of frames per second that's
simply<00:03:33.390> because<00:03:33.420> i'm<00:03:33.780> running<00:03:34.080> for<00:03:34.110> apps<00:03:34.319> at

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
simply because i'm running for apps at

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.580 
simply because i'm running for apps at
the<00:03:34.530> same<00:03:34.620> time<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.069> running<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> server

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the same time is running the server

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280 
the same time is running the server
what's<00:03:37.590> also<00:03:37.769> nice<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.690> limit<00:03:39.690> for<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
what's also nice is that limit for the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.020 
what's also nice is that limit for the
cruise<00:03:40.470> altitude<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:41.250> only<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:41.760> when<00:03:41.879> you're

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
cruise altitude is only for when you're

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.449 
cruise altitude is only for when you're
cruising<00:03:42.450> pointed<00:03:43.019> towards<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.349> horizon<00:03:43.459> so

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
cruising pointed towards the horizon so

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.619 
cruising pointed towards the horizon so
if<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.700> wanted<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.299> could<00:03:45.450> point

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
if you wanted to you could point

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.890 
if you wanted to you could point
downwards<00:03:46.230> or<00:03:46.409> even<00:03:46.799> point<00:03:47.040> upwards<00:03:47.459> and

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
downwards or even point upwards and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.899 
downwards or even point upwards and
descend<00:03:50.000> beyond<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.599> edges<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.140> map<00:03:52.909> so

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
descend beyond the edges of the map so

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.119 
descend beyond the edges of the map so
now<00:03:54.060> I'm<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.599> can<00:03:55.200> fly<00:03:55.439> higher<00:03:55.650> than<00:03:55.709> an<00:03:55.980> eagle

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
now I'm I can fly higher than an eagle

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.050 
now I'm I can fly higher than an eagle

you're pointing a there's depending on

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.460 
you're pointing a there's depending on
your<00:04:30.180> angle<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.600> degree<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.110> when<00:04:31.350> you're

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
your angle of degree like when you're

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.640 
your angle of degree like when you're
pointing<00:04:31.860> at<00:04:32.820> 60<00:04:33.270> degrees<00:04:33.300> off<00:04:34.139> in<00:04:34.560> the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
pointing at 60 degrees off in the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.340 
pointing at 60 degrees off in the
distance<00:04:34.830> it'll<00:04:35.389> 62<00:04:36.389> 30<00:04:36.600> degrees<00:04:36.900> it'll<00:04:37.110> take

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
distance it'll 62 30 degrees it'll take

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.310 
distance it'll 62 30 degrees it'll take
you<00:04:38.479> forward<00:04:39.479> three<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.080> when<00:04:40.199> you're

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
you forward three and when you're

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.200 
you forward three and when you're
pointing<00:04:40.680> down<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:40.979> 75<00:04:41.400> degrees<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.850> only<00:04:41.970> take

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
pointing down is 75 degrees it only take

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.830 
pointing down is 75 degrees it only take
you<00:04:42.300> forward<00:04:42.539> like<00:04:42.750> 1.5<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.850> when<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.539> go

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
you forward like 1.5 so when you go

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.930 
you forward like 1.5 so when you go
forward<00:04:46.320> like<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:47.250> can<00:04:47.430> come<00:04:47.610> in<00:04:47.729> for<00:04:47.910> a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
forward like this you can come in for a

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.400 
forward like this you can come in for a
precise<00:04:48.240> landing<00:04:48.510> an<00:04:48.900> object<00:04:50.180> excuse<00:04:51.180> me
