00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.899 
I don't know anything about welding so
it's<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.720> guy<00:01:28.409> doing<00:01:28.460> making<00:01:29.460> itself<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it's just a guy doing making itself a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.380 
it's just a guy doing making itself a
stove<00:01:30.259> alright<00:01:31.579> alright<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.000> cut<00:01:33.210> off<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

stove alright alright so we cut off the
the<00:01:34.110> top<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> hardest<00:01:34.860> part<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> taking

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the top the hardest part was a taking

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.390 
the top the hardest part was a taking
out<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.840> valve<00:01:37.110> anyway<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> won't<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.369> into

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
out the the valve anyway I won't go into

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.359 
out the the valve anyway I won't go into
the<00:01:38.820> specifics<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.860> make<00:01:40.860> sure<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.130> bleed

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the specifics but make sure you bleed
