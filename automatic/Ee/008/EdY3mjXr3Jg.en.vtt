00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
on order to shoot a base and then

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.970 
on order to shoot a base and then
immediately<00:00:06.660> somehow<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.109> right<00:00:07.350> at<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.680> at

the<00:00:08.040> base<00:00:08.429> i<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.820> really<00:00:09.269> don't<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.960> that

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the base i I really don't get that

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.870 
the base i I really don't get that
that's<00:00:10.740> kind<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.130> little<00:00:11.250> bit<00:00:11.460> confusing

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
that's kind of a little bit confusing

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.509 
that's kind of a little bit confusing
than<00:00:12.059> anyone<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.780> guess<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.769> probably<00:00:14.099> just

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
than anyone I guess it's probably just

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.310 
than anyone I guess it's probably just
an<00:00:14.670> observation<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.660> shouldn't<00:00:16.199> really

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
an observation and I shouldn't really

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.950 
an observation and I shouldn't really
think<00:00:16.710> too<00:00:16.890> much<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.640> my<00:00:18.600> plane

shuttle at the end of mission a lot

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
shuttle at the end of mission a lot
easier<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.190> we've<00:00:54.120> dealt<00:00:54.480> with

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
easier so in this one we've dealt with

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.170 
easier so in this one we've dealt with
flying<00:00:54.960> over<00:00:55.320> clouds<00:00:55.559> we've<00:00:56.160> flown<00:00:56.640> over<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
flying over clouds we've flown over the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.010 
flying over clouds we've flown over the
ocean<00:00:57.600> we've<00:00:57.840> flown<00:00:58.199> over<00:00:58.550> dirt<00:00:59.809> what<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.930> we

flying over in this one well the sky is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.710 
flying over in this one well the sky is
slightly<00:01:04.229> darker<00:01:04.979> shade<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> blue<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.909> we're

over clouds once again well at least
start<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.439> over<00:01:11.070> clouds<00:01:11.340> again<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
enemies from the previous levels you'll

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.030 
enemies from the previous levels you'll
get<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:23.729> over<00:01:23.759> again<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.140> now

get to see them all over again so we now
will<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.729> track<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.900> them<00:01:28.170> so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
will kind of track through all them so

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.880 
will kind of track through all them so
it's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.939> very<00:01:30.270> long<00:01:30.509> mission<00:01:31.020> yeah<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.560> not

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's a very long mission yeah it's not

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.819 
it's a very long mission yeah it's not
very<00:01:32.119> very<00:01:33.119> short<00:01:33.509> say<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> least<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
very very short say the least and

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.160 
very very short say the least and
dealing<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.210> dealing<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
dealing with up in dealing with this

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.580 
dealing with up in dealing with this
mission<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:38.689> mean<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> final<00:01:40.320> mission

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
mission I mean it is the final mission

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.810 
mission I mean it is the final mission
but<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.009> takes<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but this one takes it like you know a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.929 
but this one takes it like you know a
good<00:01:42.409> six<00:01:43.409> seven<00:01:43.770> eight<00:01:43.979> minutes<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.700> by

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
good six seven eight minutes or so by

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.460 
good six seven eight minutes or so by
itself<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.780> able<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.290> way

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
itself would be able to get all the way

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.039 
itself would be able to get all the way
through<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.060> which<00:01:48.060> especially<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.869> end

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
through it which especially if you end

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
through it which especially if you end
up<00:01:49.170> dying<00:01:49.470> during<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:51.030> what

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
up dying during it is then you know what

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
up dying during it is then you know what
is<00:01:51.450> ends<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.840> being<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.290> most<00:01:52.530> annoying<00:01:53.070> part

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
is ends up being the most annoying part

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.620 
is ends up being the most annoying part
about<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.700> whole<00:01:53.759> mission<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.390> why

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
about this whole mission and why

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
about this whole mission and why
probably<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.549> they

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
probably a lot of people even if they

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.370 
probably a lot of people even if they
finally<00:01:57.000> got<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.450> part<00:01:57.750> won't<00:01:57.960> even<00:01:58.200> get

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
finally got to this part won't even get

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.120 
finally got to this part won't even get
past<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.979> mission

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
past this mission

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.680 
past this mission
and<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.910> worst<00:02:02.090> thing<00:02:02.180> about<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.600> is

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
and the worst thing about it is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.420 
and the worst thing about it is
nothing's<00:02:03.110> changed<00:02:03.560> from<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.860> previous<00:02:03.890> ones

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
nothing's changed from the previous ones

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.590 
nothing's changed from the previous ones
like<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.670> because<00:02:04.910> basically<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.570> a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
like it because basically it's a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.840 
like it because basically it's a
compilation<00:02:05.990> level<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:07.130> all<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.460> previous

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
compilation level of all the previous

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.440 
compilation level of all the previous
levels<00:02:08.240> so<00:02:09.009> nothing<00:02:10.009> new<00:02:10.039> happens<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:11.090> just

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
levels so nothing new happens it's just

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.670 
levels so nothing new happens it's just
the<00:02:11.570> stuff<00:02:11.780> we've<00:02:11.990> already<00:02:12.080> really<00:02:12.530> been

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the stuff we've already really been

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.500 
the stuff we've already really been
dealing<00:02:13.010> with<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:14.030> now<00:02:14.150> we're<00:02:14.300> going<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> move

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
dealing with so now we're going to move

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.750 
dealing with so now we're going to move
from<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> air<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:16.250> we're<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.550> go<00:02:16.730> over

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
from the air and we're going to go over

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.560 
from the air and we're going to go over
the<00:02:17.209> ocean<00:02:17.630> now<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.880> instead<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.270> seeing<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
the ocean now so instead of seeing the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.910 
the ocean now so instead of seeing the
clouds<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.080> bottom<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:21.620> see<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
clouds on the bottom we now see a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.090 
clouds on the bottom we now see a
slightly<00:02:22.790> lighter<00:02:23.360> shade<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:23.990> blue<00:02:24.530> than<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
slightly lighter shade of blue than the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.949 
slightly lighter shade of blue than the
sky<00:02:25.400> now<00:02:25.610> before<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.240> course<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.570> sky<00:02:26.810> was

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
sky now before of course the sky was

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.720 
sky now before of course the sky was
lighter<00:02:27.200> than<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.530> ocean<00:02:27.740> but<00:02:28.040> now<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:28.459> my

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
lighter than the ocean but now that's my

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.590 
lighter than the ocean but now that's my
time<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:30.080> sky<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.500> slightly<00:02:31.130> darker<00:02:31.670> than<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
time the sky is slightly darker than the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.110 
time the sky is slightly darker than the
actual<00:02:32.780> ocean<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.470> time<00:02:33.739> around<00:02:34.120> big

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
actual ocean this time around big

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.430 
actual ocean this time around big

this<00:04:03.170> enemy<00:04:03.620> space<00:04:03.890> shuttle<00:04:04.280> than<00:04:04.459> me<00:04:04.640> who<00:04:04.880> was

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
this enemy space shuttle than me who was

like<00:04:05.180> all<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.540> way<00:04:05.660> on<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.840> opposite<00:04:06.320> side<00:04:06.530> of

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
like all the way on the opposite side of

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.750 
like all the way on the opposite side of
the<00:04:06.680> world<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.250> know<00:04:07.340> that's<00:04:07.519> what<00:04:07.700> it

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
so now with my fuel being empty you can

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.129 
so now with my fuel being empty you can
expect<00:04:14.220> all<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:15.330> know<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.750> all<00:04:15.840> expect

must<00:05:47.610> have<00:05:47.699> flown<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:47.970> long<00:05:48.240> way<00:05:48.449> guys<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:48.750> didn't

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
must have flown a long way guys I didn't

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.839 
must have flown a long way guys I didn't
think<00:05:49.410> planes<00:05:49.770> need<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.130> refuel<00:05:50.460> every<00:05:50.669> like

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
think planes need to refuel every like

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.089 
think planes need to refuel every like
three<00:05:51.120> seconds<00:05:51.599> so<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:51.840> in<00:05:52.139> in<00:05:52.530> terms<00:05:52.680> of<00:05:52.919> the

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
three seconds so I in in terms of the

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.680 
three seconds so I in in terms of the
actual<00:05:53.220> game<00:05:53.430> time<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:54.210> everything<00:05:54.389> you<00:05:54.660> know

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
actual game time and everything you know

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.300 
actual game time and everything you know
i<00:05:54.780> guess<00:05:54.870> i<00:05:55.080> would<00:05:55.139> have<00:05:55.229> freshly<00:05:55.560> blown<00:05:56.280> a

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
i guess i would have freshly blown a

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.219 
i guess i would have freshly blown a
very<00:05:56.760> good<00:05:57.030> distance<00:05:57.479> which<00:05:57.720> once<00:05:57.930> again<00:05:58.080> is

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
very good distance which once again is

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.870 
very good distance which once again is
the<00:05:58.470> point<00:05:58.680> of<00:05:58.800> why<00:05:59.010> wasn't<00:05:59.490> there<00:05:59.580> another

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
the point of why wasn't there another

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.360 
the point of why wasn't there another
aircraft<00:06:00.270> closer<00:06:01.139> than<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.099> one<00:06:02.250> I'm

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
aircraft closer than the one I'm

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.730 
aircraft closer than the one I'm
currently<00:06:02.400> piloting<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.050> enemy<00:06:04.470> wherever

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
currently piloting to the enemy wherever

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.210 
currently piloting to the enemy wherever
you<00:06:05.250> know<00:06:05.340> whatever<00:06:05.550> enemy<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:07.020> this<00:06:07.889> parts<00:06:08.160> a

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
you know whatever enemy and this parts a

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.700 
you know whatever enemy and this parts a
lot<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.490> fun<00:06:08.669> as<00:06:08.910> I'm<00:06:09.120> over<00:06:09.960> like<00:06:10.169> a<00:06:10.199> snowy

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
lot of fun as I'm over like a snowy

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.089 
lot of fun as I'm over like a snowy
place<00:06:11.190> I<00:06:11.550> guess<00:06:12.380> is<00:06:13.380> it's<00:06:13.530> supposed<00:06:13.860> to<00:06:13.919> be<00:06:14.070> a

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
place I guess is it's supposed to be a

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.070 
place I guess is it's supposed to be a
snow-covered<00:06:14.820> ground

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
snow-covered ground

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.059 
snow-covered ground
is<00:06:16.650> what<00:06:17.370> we're<00:06:17.520> flying<00:06:17.879> over<00:06:18.150> right<00:06:18.479> now<00:06:18.509> I

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.069 
is what we're flying over right now I

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.320 
is what we're flying over right now I
mean<00:06:20.069> I<00:06:20.129> always<00:06:20.310> think<00:06:20.759> that's<00:06:21.030> what<00:06:21.180> we're

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
mean I always think that's what we're

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.460 
mean I always think that's what we're
flying<00:06:21.569> over<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.050> that's<00:06:22.169> what's<00:06:22.349> supposed

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
flying over and that's what's supposed

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.610 
flying over and that's what's supposed
to<00:06:22.800> be<00:06:23.780> even<00:06:24.780> though<00:06:24.900> nothing<00:06:25.349> else<00:06:25.500> has

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
to be even though nothing else has

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.809 
to be even though nothing else has
really<00:06:25.889> changed<00:06:26.129> in<00:06:26.520> terms<00:06:26.639> of<00:06:26.789> the<00:06:26.879> gameplay

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
really changed in terms of the gameplay

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.219 
really changed in terms of the gameplay
good<00:06:29.819> news<00:06:30.030> is<00:06:30.240> we're<00:06:30.479> actually<00:06:30.659> really<00:06:31.080> not

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
good news is we're actually really not

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.409 
good news is we're actually really not
too<00:06:31.439> far<00:06:31.710> from<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:32.099> enemy<00:06:32.400> I<00:06:32.430> would<00:06:32.969> hope<00:06:33.150> so

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
too far from the enemy I would hope so

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.749 
too far from the enemy I would hope so
we've<00:06:33.870> been<00:06:34.050> flying<00:06:34.680> around<00:06:34.860> now<00:06:35.250> it<00:06:35.460> feels

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
we've been flying around now it feels

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.450 
we've been flying around now it feels
like<00:06:35.879> hours<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:37.830> know<00:06:37.949> it's<00:06:38.069> not<00:06:38.189> really<00:06:38.430> a

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
like hours you know it's not really a

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.100 
like hours you know it's not really a
super<00:06:38.789> long<00:06:38.909> game<00:06:39.180> but<00:06:39.449> man<00:06:39.629> does<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.900> feel

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
super long game but man does it feel

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.659 
super long game but man does it feel
like<00:06:40.289> it<00:06:40.500> it's<00:06:40.830> one<00:06:40.979> of<00:06:41.069> those<00:06:41.159> types<00:06:41.490> of<00:06:41.610> games

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
like it it's one of those types of games

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.029 
like it it's one of those types of games
wait<00:06:42.150> a<00:06:42.180> minute<00:06:42.629> you<00:06:43.379> know<00:06:43.409> ends<00:06:43.710> up<00:06:43.800> being<00:06:43.949> a

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
wait a minute you know ends up being a

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.249 
wait a minute you know ends up being a
real<00:06:44.189> big<00:06:44.370> paint<00:06:44.669> as<00:06:44.969> you<00:06:45.750> can<00:06:45.810> see<00:06:46.020> I'm<00:06:46.110> doing

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
real big paint as you can see I'm doing

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:47.779 
real big paint as you can see I'm doing
with<00:06:46.439> a<00:06:46.500> little<00:06:46.710> bit<00:06:46.800> of<00:06:46.830> helicopters<00:06:47.610> now

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
with a little bit of helicopters now

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.490 
with a little bit of helicopters now
instead<00:06:48.150> of<00:06:48.210> natural<00:06:48.719> the<00:06:48.840> other<00:06:48.960> aircraft

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
instead of natural the other aircraft

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.670 
instead of natural the other aircraft
but<00:06:49.800> it's<00:06:50.699> only<00:06:51.030> a<00:06:51.150> sprite<00:06:51.900> difference<00:06:52.379> it

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
but it's only a sprite difference it

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.409 
but it's only a sprite difference it
really<00:06:52.889> is<00:06:53.099> no<00:06:53.340> difference<00:06:53.819> between<00:06:53.909> the<00:06:54.270> two

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
really is no difference between the two

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.629 
really is no difference between the two
enemies<00:06:54.810> other<00:06:55.560> than<00:06:55.979> what<00:06:56.280> they<00:06:56.400> look<00:06:56.610> like

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
enemies other than what they look like

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.270 
enemies other than what they look like
an<00:06:56.940> appearance<00:06:57.389> yeah<00:06:58.289> so<00:06:58.590> that<00:06:58.889> that<00:06:59.069> whole

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
an appearance yeah so that that whole

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.709 
an appearance yeah so that that whole
thing<00:06:59.639> really<00:06:59.849> doesn't<00:07:00.210> make<00:07:00.270> any<00:07:00.449> difference

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:00.719 
thing really doesn't make any difference

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.659 
thing really doesn't make any difference
either<00:07:02.449> okay<00:07:03.449> we<00:07:03.599> got<00:07:03.629> to<00:07:03.930> be<00:07:04.020> close<00:07:04.340> it<00:07:05.340> can't

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
either okay we got to be close it can't

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.580 
either okay we got to be close it can't
be<00:07:05.789> too<00:07:06.000> much<00:07:06.180> farther<00:07:06.479> another<00:07:07.349> helicopter

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
be too much farther another helicopter

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.600 
be too much farther another helicopter
