00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 good evening lewis words but look at you it 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.740
 also loaded the goal both made me 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.060
 pleasure of making the first goal in a series a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.859
 that I didn't expect it despite everything 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.260
 we had a great game 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.289
 we did not take what was a step 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.560
 forward that is shared with a few 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.630
 difficulty on the left can be said if not 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 the coach a good found me well 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.649
 make me change on the other side ha 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.940
 found the goal immediately then raised the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.309
 game thirty seconds later 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.100
 if as a band you changed 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.289
 that profession was deep and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 then also marked in short on the right is one 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.360
 program to itself because I am used to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.980
 playing right did not play left 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420
 from 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.040
 last year against Catania the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.970
 first leg 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.920
 so still I got lost but it happens 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.300
 the ris lived a difficult period 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.720
 last year where all of you 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.940
 happy in the group, I am very happy 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.509
 also because I love it 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.280
 so where did the right company in 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:19.940
 how important it was 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.430
 very important because we come from one 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.340
 bad defeat against juventus 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.070
 so we needed one to leave 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.930
 particular team victory over 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.509
 four is no but I do find myself 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.640
 ready because you know you never know if it does 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.140
 bad a right goes from the right is 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.039
 forming an abstinence to be paid into 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 to be bad or not for me you feel four 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.240
 months after the leading derby in 26 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 I obviously eat erin on air in 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.300
 another one 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.920
 there is a particular situation now 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.910
 you are ready to live it as a holder who 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.770
 emotions you feel a week away 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.720
 before we had a game on Thursday 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.619
 so first let's think about the game 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.990
 Thursday from here you can see the match of 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.090
 third mentally helps to have one 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.099
 match with a draw and in a week 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.959
 rome, in other words, our small town e 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.690
 what you had commitments then 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.450
 having a head on Thursday is important 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.239
 to prepare you want to come 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.890
 if, however, we have to go ahead 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.810
 then battles for beating them first 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.560
 we win Thursday and then we think about that 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:34.280
 of the derby with the knowledge that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:38.269
 this is because the chapter is closed 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.310
 now we have won another is now 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.310
 chapter you have to win that too
