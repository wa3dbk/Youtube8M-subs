00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:10.070
 yeah 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.750
 But it has ended up straight is Hello Ohori 123 a there you contents 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.210
 I Oh I am today 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.529
 Though I would like to continue but is not introduced it is the pick to improve the previous 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.580
 Is this time too 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.760
 Actually there is a review of the pick 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:29.430
 It is here and this is also the same hair 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.410
 Speaking of Takamine, it's this Eleako manufacturer foremost or sound Janesu accessories too 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:38.520
 Takamine or a matter of course while making and he is now the Imaho well pick Toka it 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.570
 I mean that he made it but also had said so, but the guy that w Tsu p 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.590
 This form is so-called tiered 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:49.270
 Drop tears I'm Poro' and Jerry Well tears Horori Naa form 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.470
 It is said that Marua is crazy, the material of this pick is used for most of the picks 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.150
 You are celluloid 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.710
 It is a kind of person that you can feel the character when you hit the game 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.560
 Midian of the fender, also using well I though you will find a medium of pick 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.220
 I have a pick 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:11.360
 But in comparison to that, it seems like the heat is as high or slightly thick as the heat 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:16.310
 I think it may be the heat in the medium range, though 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.360
 The real is the Tteyuu w Tsu p jaw it is in the current catalog to the current heights 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.580
 Unfortunately I am not riding but I think maybe production is over 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.760
 Oh dear 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 First of all, there was a lot of things going on between the cats 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.550
 I think that I can still get it, though 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 On the back it is not visible rash When I's a little expensive first feature light of this pick 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.480
 It is n't good either. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.200
 It is difficult to pile up, but this is actually non- slip made of celluloid of God 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.159
 pick 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.149
 Apparently, it seems that this non-slip processing has been done 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.990
 Because certainly ordinary arrive Toka leverage alignment Tsu pick and when soon slip there 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.950
 Well I used to use a non-slip pick I used to use, but I think I have never exceeded it 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.439
 There is a time 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.220
 But there's one big mountain and I can't slip it, I think it's not sustainable 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.270
 I think it would be better to 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.440
 It was something or stick to the Toka the body of the guitar and this turned a blind of this I hobbling 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.250
 Pretty but that process is now a little story long I'd be there when that's hard 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.450
 I will try to pull back a bit of what it looks like 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.450
 Please take a look 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.359

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.940
 car 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.940

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.700

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.599
 me 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.770
 goo 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.770
 Hmm 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.000
 aWell I would like to go back to the impression I tried using 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:01.130
 There has been a slip just now Kedomo I'm gone sweaty I of the'd Te' fingertip little 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.910
 Better is Nema what slip I thought to Fu called Do Mars Do Te your enshrined new book which is also Well Consumable 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.840
 And Do not be better to was the time of the target mean is I will take Nde going to 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.769
 Thoroughly seems to me Monja 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.760
 I think there is no, and I think celluloid and I feel good after all 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:19.680
 Also it is using me well or rather easy to understand cat or clearly Tteyuu the I response 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.770
 I feel that I have the same leg shape as the Fender midian pick I showed earlier 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.860
 Masu get or is this I'm a quite number one even if 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.360
 In the sense that there is a feeling of strength I say that it is very good because there is a response 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.840
 So I Tteyuu the I in addition this form Teardrop pick guard is formed of Rakuri Fu 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.189
 I especially really Pau lead animals but did you say the pickguard 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.819
 Or that it is possible to draw Datte seemingly reality firmly that this previously have pointed 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:46.419
 I feel that it is good that I can pick it up reliably 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.849
 After all because there are exciting stroke there was and was not going to Yappa force at the stroke 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.069
 This 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:54.680
 It is quite a teardrop pick guard that I am the most with a large rice ball type pick 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:59.300
 Though it can not also be used rarely the Tteyuu 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:03.050
 I think try to use it the ne different form Once again Well Toka but still say Do and 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.919
 The players are nervous about the fact that everyone has already processed the non-slip 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:11.270
 If there is a thing that was very firm we have a common feeling as I previously also said 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.229
 Well pick various shapes and Nde really Nanbo of the world to try also that the various materials 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.670
 What are you 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:18.420
 All means well try it is this video in the wake of 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:23.670
 In I think that I think we say also would like to see all means for this 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:28.440
 p w w If it sees in the oyster shop, it should be good to use it by all means 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:32.720
 I mean that yes I though I think that way also Ohori that I'll see you next time 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.720
 Goodbye it was there 123
