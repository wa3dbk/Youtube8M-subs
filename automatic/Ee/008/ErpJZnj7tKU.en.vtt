SHE STILL HASN'T RECEIVED NOTICE

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000

CURRENT STOCK IS GONE.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
FROM THE LOOKS OF THE SHELVES,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.133
IT WON'T BE LONG.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
HMM.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
THAT BAD.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
THERE'S A REAL EMOTIONAL

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
COMPONENT TO A PRODUCT THAT'S

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
BEEN AROUND FOR 82 YEARS.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I BOUGHT THESE AS EXAMPLES.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
MY MOTHER WOULD NOT GO A DAY

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.066
WITHOUT HAVING THESE THINGS FOR

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
BREAKFAST.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
THEM, THE SMELL, JUST REMEMBER

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
THIS STUFF.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
WHEN WE CLEANED OUT MY PARENTS'

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
HOUSE AFTER THEIR DEATH, WE

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.866
FOUND A BOX OF THESE INSPECT

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
CUPBOARD.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
WE JOKED WE SHOULD HAVE BURIED

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
THEM WITH MY FATHER, HE LOVED

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
THE THINGS.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
WHEN YOU'VE GOT AN   2-YEAR-OLD

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
PRODUCT IT GETS INTO THE PSYCHE

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
OF AMERICANS AND CONSUMERS.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE IDENTIFY WITH

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
IT, SURE.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
DON'T YOU THINK THE BRAND IS

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
STILL VIABLE, SOME OTHER COMPANY

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
IS GOING TO COME IN AND RESCUE

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
THESE PRODUCTS?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I WOULD THINK SO.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
CERTAINLY FROM MY

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
UNSCIENTIFIC STUDY TODAY, THERE

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
IS A LOT OF CONSUMER LOYALTY FOR

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
THESE PRODUCTS.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
AND IF THEY STICK THAT HARD WITH

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
ME, WHAT IS IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
THAT'S RIGHT.
