more that you are aware of these things
and<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:19.260> me<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:19.590> out<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.160> filming<00:00:20.460> things

and for me going out and filming things

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.880 
and for me going out and filming things
that<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.210> become<00:00:21.660> aware<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.050> changes<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.330 

my<00:00:34.760> general<00:00:35.150> practice<00:00:35.720> of<00:00:36.020> making<00:00:36.920> films

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
my general practice of making films

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.200 
my general practice of making films
which<00:00:38.120> is<00:00:38.680> very<00:00:39.680> much<00:00:39.770> like<00:00:40.190> going<00:00:40.400> out<00:00:40.730> or

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
which is very much like going out or

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.210 
which is very much like going out or
like<00:00:41.750> being<00:00:41.930> in<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.140> studio<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.590> drawing<00:00:42.920> or

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
like being in the studio and drawing or

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.350 
like being in the studio and drawing or
writing<00:00:43.610> or<00:00:43.700> something<00:00:44.000> it's<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.180> very

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
writing or something it's a very

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.590 
writing or something it's a very
continual<00:00:44.990> thing<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:45.620> less<00:00:46.600> preconceived

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
continual thing it's less preconceived

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.950 
continual thing it's less preconceived
or<00:00:48.320> having<00:00:48.770> say<00:00:48.950> a<00:00:48.980> script<00:00:49.430> it's<00:00:50.390> more<00:00:50.720> like<00:00:50.870> a

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
or having say a script it's more like a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.790 
or having say a script it's more like a
kind<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.320> going<00:00:51.920> out<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.100> gathering<00:00:56.500> and<00:00:57.500> as<00:00:57.680> I

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
kind of going out and gathering and as I

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.010 
kind of going out and gathering and as I
go<00:00:57.950> along<00:00:58.070> I<00:00:58.460> get<00:00:58.580> more<00:00:58.820> images<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.660> know

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
go along I get more images you know

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.610 
go along I get more images you know
clusters<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:00.830> kind<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.280> shapes<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:02.620> sequences

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
clusters of kind of shapes of sequences

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.570 
clusters of kind of shapes of sequences
perhaps<00:01:04.190> starts<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.059> suggest<00:01:05.540> themselves<00:01:05.780> and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
perhaps starts to suggest themselves and

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.500 
perhaps starts to suggest themselves and
as<00:01:07.580> those<00:01:08.090> are<00:01:08.540> edited<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:10.640> film<00:01:10.940> starts<00:01:11.330> to

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
as those are edited the film starts to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.350 
as those are edited the film starts to
create<00:01:11.810> its<00:01:12.229> own<00:01:12.590> weight<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.790> know<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.240> it

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
create its own weight you know and it

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.330 
create its own weight you know and it
has<00:01:14.510> densities<00:01:15.260> that<00:01:15.650> accumulate<00:01:16.310> in

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
has densities that accumulate in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.940 
has densities that accumulate in
different<00:01:16.910> parts<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.720> then<00:01:17.869> once<00:01:18.229> those<00:01:18.560> get

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
different parts and then once those get

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.609 
different parts and then once those get
to<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.160> certain<00:01:19.340> stage<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:20.479> they<00:01:20.720> just<00:01:20.960> link

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
to a certain stage then they just link

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.030 
to a certain stage then they just link
together

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.220 
as an artist-in-residence at the
Exploratorium<00:01:28.650> I've<00:01:29.460> had<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.210> few<00:01:30.540> years<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
Exploratorium I've had a few years to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.760 
Exploratorium I've had a few years to
work<00:01:31.800> on<00:01:32.130> several<00:01:33.120> projects<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.990> first<00:01:34.020> was

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
work on several projects the first was

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.190 
work on several projects the first was
called<00:01:35.190> compound<00:01:35.910> eyes<00:01:36.120> which<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> series

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
called compound eyes which was a series

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.540 
called compound eyes which was a series
of<00:01:37.260> insect<00:01:37.800> studies<00:01:38.190> I<00:01:39.980> worked<00:01:40.980> on<00:01:41.160> a<00:01:41.220> light

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
of insect studies I worked on a light

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.200 
of insect studies I worked on a light
sculpture<00:01:42.360> installation<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:43.530> night<00:01:43.890> signals

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
sculpture installation of night signals

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.210 
sculpture installation of night signals
and<00:01:46.300> then<00:01:46.990> since<00:01:47.290> then<00:01:47.470> I've<00:01:47.590> been<00:01:47.680> working<00:01:47.860> on

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
and then since then I've been working on

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.270 
and then since then I've been working on
a<00:01:48.430> film<00:01:48.730> that<00:01:49.180> could<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.380> an<00:01:50.560> impressionistic

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
a film that could in an impressionistic

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.310 
a film that could in an impressionistic
way<00:01:51.930> try<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:52.960> study<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.700> environment<00:01:55.320> that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
way try to study the environment that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.740 
way try to study the environment that
the<00:01:56.980> Exploratorium<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.820> new<00:01:57.970> Exploratorium

the Exploratorium the new Exploratorium

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.440 
the Exploratorium the new Exploratorium
is<00:01:58.930> moving<00:01:59.260> into<00:01:59.620> this<00:02:00.160> area<00:02:00.760> of<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.060> piers

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
is moving into this area of the piers

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.070 
is moving into this area of the piers

the Exploratorium but what that space is
like<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.920> then<00:02:15.040> also<00:02:15.190> historically<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.720> know

and<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.580> kind<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.910> way<00:02:37.360> you're<00:02:37.540> approaching

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
and a kind of way you're approaching

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.170 
and a kind of way you're approaching
this<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> project<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:39.160> still<00:02:39.459> try<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> start

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
this is a project I still try to start

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.340 
this is a project I still try to start
with<00:02:41.160> nothing<00:02:42.160> each<00:02:42.640> time<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:44.050> always

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
with nothing each time and so I always

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.850 
with nothing each time and so I always
find<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.860> kind<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.130> struggle<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.880> know<00:02:45.910> and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
find a kind of struggle you know and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.470 
find a kind of struggle you know and
part<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> learning<00:02:48.520> process<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.940> trying

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
part of the learning process is trying

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.280 
part of the learning process is trying
to<00:02:49.980> put<00:02:50.980> together<00:02:51.130> ideas<00:02:51.519> on<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.690> spot<00:02:52.989> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
to put together ideas on the spot and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.070 
to put together ideas on the spot and
also<00:02:54.130> perhaps<00:02:54.549> learning<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.540> adapt

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.800 

I<00:03:01.170> often<00:03:01.740> tried<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:03.150> shoot<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.660> way

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
I often tried it to shoot in a way

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.270 
I often tried it to shoot in a way
that's<00:03:04.050> not<00:03:04.230> about<00:03:04.500> getting<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:05.010> perfect

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
that's not about getting the perfect

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.580 
that's not about getting the perfect
take<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:05.970> more<00:03:06.300> like<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.840> drawing<00:03:07.230> like

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
take but more like in drawing like

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.800 
take but more like in drawing like
trying<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.100> get<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> very<00:03:08.700> true<00:03:09.230> genuine<00:03:10.230> line<00:03:10.590> I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
trying to get a very true genuine line I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.660 
trying to get a very true genuine line I
like<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.960> idea<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:14.040> trying<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.460> make

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
like the idea of really trying to make

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.300 
like the idea of really trying to make
that<00:03:14.970> line<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.200> first<00:03:16.470> moment<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.250> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that line in the first moment so it's a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:27.200 
that line in the first moment so it's a
kind<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.580> genuine<00:03:18.050> mark

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.860 

I<00:03:27.300> think<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.350> like<00:03:28.530> film<00:03:28.860> because<00:03:29.190> I'm<00:03:29.580> I'm<00:03:30.510> just

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
I think I like film because I'm I'm just

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.540 
I think I like film because I'm I'm just
struck<00:03:31.200> when<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.470> see<00:03:31.740> something<00:03:32.100> that's<00:03:32.280> very

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
struck when I see something that's very

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.550 
struck when I see something that's very
beautiful<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.240> I'm<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.600> find<00:03:33.990> film<00:03:34.320> very

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
beautiful and I'm I find film very

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.280 
beautiful and I'm I find film very
beautiful<00:03:35.040> when<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.190> see<00:03:35.460> a<00:03:35.490> red<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:36.450> film

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
beautiful when I see a red on film

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.860 
beautiful when I see a red on film
I<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.950> feel<00:03:38.310> startled<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.210> you<00:03:39.570> know<00:03:39.690> it's

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
I just feel startled as you know it's

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.270 
I just feel startled as you know it's
like<00:03:40.050> an<00:03:40.170> emotional<00:03:40.650> response<00:03:42.500> also<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:44.070> fact

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
like an emotional response also the fact

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.060 
like an emotional response also the fact
that<00:03:44.370> film<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.360> finite<00:03:45.900> thing<00:03:46.320> it's<00:03:46.710> it's

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
that film is this finite thing it's it's

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.330 
that film is this finite thing it's it's
kind<00:03:47.460> of<00:03:47.610> precious<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.450> way<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.740> it<00:03:50.160> has

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
kind of precious in a way and so it has

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.300 
kind of precious in a way and so it has
a<00:03:50.370> fragility<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.720> find<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.650> is

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
a fragility and I find that is is

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.700 
a fragility and I find that is is
something<00:03:53.580> that's<00:03:53.850> very<00:03:54.120> much<00:03:54.480> like

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
something that's very much like

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.100 
something that's very much like
experiencing<00:03:55.710> things<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.370> things<00:03:56.670> are

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
experiencing things that things are

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.960 
experiencing things that things are
happening<00:03:58.110> around<00:03:58.230> us<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.890> passing<00:03:59.790> us<00:03:59.940> by

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
happening around us and passing us by

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.380 
happening around us and passing us by
and<00:04:00.680> temporary<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.010> film<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> kind<00:04:03.180> of

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
and temporary and film is a kind of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.200 
and temporary and film is a kind of
temporary<00:04:03.810> element<00:04:04.440> which<00:04:04.880> reminds<00:04:05.880> me<00:04:05.940> of

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
temporary element which reminds me of

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.790 
temporary element which reminds me of
the<00:04:06.240> original<00:04:06.390> experience<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.620> guess

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
the original experience and I guess

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:21.960 
the original experience and I guess
that's<00:04:08.040> something<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.490> I<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.940> find<00:04:09.300> genuine

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.030
