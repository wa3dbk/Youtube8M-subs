00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
some cards here for hard hat where I

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.849 
some cards here for hard hat where I
start<00:00:14.130> things<00:00:14.400> off<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:15.150> Dom<00:00:15.619> that<00:00:16.619> then

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
start things off with a Dom that then

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
left side of the map we're gonna have a

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.479 
left side of the map we're gonna have a
path<00:00:21.659> that's<00:00:22.109> what<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.859> usually<00:00:22.979> like<00:00:23.159> to<00:00:23.310> call

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:23.489 
path that's what we usually like to call

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:24.919

it<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.849> want<00:00:24.089> to<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.449> separate<00:00:24.899> it

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
it if you want to you can separate it

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.460 
it if you want to you can separate it
with<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.289> wood<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.829> a<00:00:25.919> dirt<00:00:26.390> moving<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
with a wood and a dirt moving on this is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.099 
with a wood and a dirt moving on this is
where<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> flag<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.159> also<00:00:29.639> located<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.239> CTF<00:00:30.809> we

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
where the flag is also located in CTF we

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.770 
where the flag is also located in CTF we
call<00:00:31.319> this<00:00:31.439> trailers<00:00:32.269> and<00:00:33.269> over<00:00:33.449> here<00:00:33.629> we<00:00:33.750> have

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
call this trailers and over here we have

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.069 
call this trailers and over here we have
pillars<00:00:35.000> kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> signify<00:00:36.390> some<00:00:36.570> things<00:00:36.780> here

let's move it back over here this part
of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.359> map<00:00:39.589> that<00:00:40.589> will<00:00:40.679> then<00:00:40.859> lead<00:00:41.010> us<00:00:41.039> into

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
of the map that will then lead us into

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.290 
of the map that will then lead us into
what<00:00:41.519> we<00:00:41.609> like<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.789> call<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.660> ramp<00:00:43.019> after<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
what we like to call see ramp after that

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
what we like to call see ramp after that
we're<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> keep<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.749> moving<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.289> here

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we're going to keep on moving over here

we're going to keep on moving over here
back<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.859> where<00:00:46.949> we<00:00:47.039> were<00:00:47.070> through<00:00:47.399> pillars

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
back to where we were through pillars

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.489 
back to where we were through pillars

construction continued on down through
it's<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> give<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> sea<00:00:58.679> dogs<00:00:58.949> that's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's going to give a sea dogs that's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.209 
it's going to give a sea dogs that's
where<00:00:59.429> the<00:00:59.489> seed<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.909> location<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.949> that<00:01:01.949> also

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
where the seed on location is that also

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
where the seed on location is that also
leads<00:01:02.399> us<00:01:02.519> into<00:01:02.670> bottom<00:01:03.089> construction<00:01:03.690> some

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
leads us into bottom construction some

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
leads us into bottom construction some
pretty<00:01:04.140> pivotal<00:01:04.290> parts<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.829> map<00:01:05.240> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
pretty pivotal parts of the map that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
pretty pivotal parts of the map that
leads<00:01:06.390> us<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:06.899> here<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> tunnel<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.399> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
leads us in over here to tunnel just a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
leads us in over here to tunnel just a
small<00:01:08.759> enough<00:01:08.970> room<00:01:09.299> call<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.810> lifts<00:01:10.079> you<00:01:10.290> know

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
small enough room call it lifts you know

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.929 
small enough room call it lifts you know
I<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.860> used<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.460> thought<00:01:11.729> throw

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I don't really used it but thought throw

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
I don't really used it but thought throw
it<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.290> leads<00:01:13.439> us<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.740> wood

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it in there that also leads us into wood

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.030 
it in there that also leads us into wood
pretty<00:01:14.850> obvious<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> wood<00:01:15.689> building

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
pretty obvious it's the wood building
