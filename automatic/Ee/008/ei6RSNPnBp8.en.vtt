actually the day before the day this

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.730 
actually the day before the day this
goes<00:00:11.969> up<00:00:12.179> which<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.450> unusual<00:00:12.599> for<00:00:13.080> me<00:00:13.290> now<00:00:13.500> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
goes up which is unusual for me now and

goes up which is unusual for me now and
for<00:00:13.860> everyone<00:00:14.130> that's<00:00:14.280> wondering<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.820> did<00:00:15.120> have

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
for everyone that's wondering I did have

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.330 
for everyone that's wondering I did have
my<00:00:15.630> math<00:00:15.929> final<00:00:16.260> today<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:16.890> long-anticipated

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
my math final today my long-anticipated

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.099 
my math final today my long-anticipated
map<00:00:18.000> final<00:00:18.359> because<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.690> actually<00:00:18.930> kind

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
map final because this is actually kind

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.000 
map final because this is actually kind
of<00:00:19.140> cool<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> lot<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.619> guys<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.890> been

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
of cool a lot of you guys have been

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.710 
of cool a lot of you guys have been
asking<00:00:20.130> me<00:00:20.340> how<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> did<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:20.970> my<00:00:21.000> math<00:00:21.240> final<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
asking me how I did on my math final and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.000 
asking me how I did on my math final and
it<00:00:21.810> makes<00:00:21.960> sense<00:00:22.109> because<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> past<00:00:22.859> few

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it makes sense because in the past few

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.470 
it makes sense because in the past few
months<00:00:23.160> sometimes<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:23.850> videos<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.269> talked

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
months sometimes in my videos I talked

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.839 
months sometimes in my videos I talked
about<00:00:24.510> math<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.439> precalc<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.580> much<00:00:26.760> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
about math and precalc and how much I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.130 
about math and precalc and how much I
fucking<00:00:27.119> hate<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:27.869> everyone

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
fucking hate it all and for everyone

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
fucking hate it all and for everyone
that<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:28.560> cares<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.980> actually<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that actually cares I actually think I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.910 
that actually cares I actually think I
did<00:00:30.420> surprisingly<00:00:31.050> good<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.619> fine<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
did surprisingly good on that fine the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.139 
did surprisingly good on that fine the
thing<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.189> though<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.369> never<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:33.000> know

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
thing is though you never really know

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.330 
thing is though you never really know
about<00:00:33.450> tests<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.110> finals<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.739> school<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.280> all

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
about tests and finals in school and all

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.440 
about tests and finals in school and all
that<00:00:35.489> shit<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> could<00:00:35.969> literally<00:00:36.210> walk

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that shit like you could literally walk

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.610 
that shit like you could literally walk
out<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> classroom<00:00:36.989> thinking<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
out of the classroom thinking you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040 
out of the classroom thinking you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
completely killed that exam and then you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
completely killed that exam and then you
check<00:00:40.350> your<00:00:40.920> grades<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.670> got<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> deal

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.310 
did not get a good grade I haven't taken
math<00:00:50.789> Nick<00:00:51.000> semester<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.899> dad<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> grade

should be it in a few days I'll let you
guys<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> did<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.289> will<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
guys know how I did and if I will in

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
guys know how I did and if I will in
fact<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.219> retaking<00:00:59.760> math<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.480> let's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
fact be retaking math or not which let's

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
fact be retaking math or not which let's
just<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.170> hope<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> don't<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
just all hope that I don't have to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.560 
just all hope that I don't have to
because<00:01:02.520> I'd<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.030> embarrassing<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
because I'd be really embarrassing and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.550 
because I'd be really embarrassing and
also<00:01:03.840> yesterday<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.350> uploaded<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:05.390> video<00:01:06.390> no<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
also yesterday I uploaded a video no I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.899 
also yesterday I uploaded a video no I
guess<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> could<00:01:08.189> call<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> video<00:01:08.610> more<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
guess you could call it a video more of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
guess you could call it a video more of
a<00:01:08.970> song<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.510> thing<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> video<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
a song the thing is with that video and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580 
a song the thing is with that video and
videos<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.670> people<00:01:12.240> either<00:01:12.590> really

took<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:27.000> breath<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.840> had<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.019> cut<00:02:28.319> in

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
took a breath and then I had a cut in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.930 
took a breath and then I had a cut in
like<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.920> hook<00:02:29.099> I<00:02:29.190> had<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> put<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.610> hook<00:02:29.790> in

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and then had to make sure everything was

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.080 
and then had to make sure everything was
synced<00:02:31.769> up<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.010> instrumental<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.819> I
