00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.100
 exactly the polisher suddenly but because 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.529
 you can take the lamp or even the usual 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:15.120

 friends will not deceive anyone 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.590
 the fact is that I am almost two 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 month was not in the native land and the car 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.420
 almost all this time was under a canopy 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 look what 2 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.960
 here we also have liquid glass well 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 Naturally traces of active recreation are visible 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 however, considering that where the car is for it 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 time spent here we are supposed to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.149
 were to see the base color metal 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.489
 Well, go accordingly immediately 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.950
 painting at least polishing in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.960
 our case just needs but 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.059
 by the way really what you need if u 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.660
 we are not lacquered scratched just lost 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.539
 former view 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.699
 liquid glass is all much easier and it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.399
 In short, well, and accordingly we look 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.570
 Further if you need a detailed answer 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.910
 Several options will try in brief 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 run through all the most simple 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 go to an authorized service wilson 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 or any other that is profiled 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.430
 on liquid glass there are specialists themselves 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.439
 will determine the degree of wear protection that is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.240
 make a diagnosis and prescribe the right one 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.430
 wrinkle cream hood it yourself and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 will bring arrived waited 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.080
 took it paid simply nowhere but then 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 own handles are not so difficult 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.189
 Especially if you are already once on a mission 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.860
 even if not wet we recall 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.720
 today the addition of at least maintaining 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.400
 liquid glass and everything is much easier 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.650
 than with the first application of options not 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.050

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.730
 scratch deep enough thick 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.440
 let's say a branch got on the way there 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.060
 Moreover, the service life of liquid glass 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.460
 crossed the equator 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.710
 better not to wait another six months but immediately 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.350
 connect heavy artillery first 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.770

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.420

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.790
 and secondly anyway so soon 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.740
 go down a new layer will fill all 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.320
 scratch marks and scratches and return level 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.180

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.090

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.090
 light refreshing effect 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.730

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.310
 shine then apply water repellent 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.230
