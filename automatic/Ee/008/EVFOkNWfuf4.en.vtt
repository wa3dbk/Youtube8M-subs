open it up and as you can see if you

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.179 
open it up and as you can see if you
change<00:03:44.659> around<00:03:44.810> your<00:03:45.109> boot<00:03:45.290> time<00:03:45.590> will<00:03:45.769> be<00:03:45.920> a

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
have this originally came with vista and

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:06.150 
have this originally came with vista and
just<00:03:52.790> let<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.239> turn<00:03:53.419> on

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
gigabytes of ram one second I'm not sure

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.560 
gigabytes of ram one second I'm not sure
you<00:04:54.340> can<00:04:54.430> see<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.640> but<00:04:54.910> there's<00:04:55.300> your<00:04:55.450> two

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
gigs of ram it will help a lot more and

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.150 
gigs of ram it will help a lot more and
this<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.320> how<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.500> change<00:05:00.100> ram<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.820> laptop
