take a look we're not going to go
through<00:00:15.179> there<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.599> I'm<00:00:15.660> probably<00:00:15.960> not

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
through there because I'm probably not

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
have not yet to see the interior of this

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.350 
have not yet to see the interior of this
so<00:00:43.140> I'll<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.950> surprises<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> we're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
so I'll be just surprises you we're

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.610 
so I'll be just surprises you we're
going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> back<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.350> work<00:00:46.440> our<00:00:46.590> way

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
going to go to the back and work our way

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
going to go to the back and work our way
forward<00:00:47.420> cool<00:00:48.420> engine<00:00:48.870> room<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:51.000> it's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
forward cool engine room and it's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500 
forward cool engine room and it's
probably<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.649> basically<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.670> how

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
probably it so basically this is how

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.139 
probably it so basically this is how
much<00:00:54.629> engines<00:00:55.110> until<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.879> front

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
much engines until we get to up front

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.470 
much engines until we get to up front
main<00:00:58.140> engine<00:00:58.590> rooms<00:00:59.010> probably<00:01:00.000> reactor

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
main engine rooms probably reactor

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
main engine rooms probably reactor
somewhere<00:01:00.809> around<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:01.199> we'll<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.890> ahead

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
somewhere around there we'll go ahead

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.579 
somewhere around there we'll go ahead
and<00:01:02.039> skip<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.850> let's<00:01:03.320> double<00:01:04.320> stairs

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and skip that so let's double stairs

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.050 
and skip that so let's double stairs
excellence<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.610> we've<00:01:05.790> seen<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
excellence go down here we've seen the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.130 
excellence go down here we've seen the
bomb<00:01:06.540> levels<00:01:07.010> storage<00:01:08.010> areas<00:01:08.479> poor<00:01:09.479> power<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
bomb levels storage areas poor power I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.560 
bomb levels storage areas poor power I
don't<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.040> those<00:01:11.250> could<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.700> bad<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.360> power

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
don't know those could be bad the power

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340 
don't know those could be bad the power
I<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:15.210> one's<00:01:15.450> definitely<00:01:15.750> power

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I think that one's definitely power

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.190 
I think that one's definitely power
consistent<00:01:17.070> nuclear<00:01:17.340> reactor<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:19.020> well

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
consistent nuclear reactor on it as well

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
consistent nuclear reactor on it as well
as<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.130> window<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> guess<00:01:20.640> but

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
as that one that's a window I guess but

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.330 
as that one that's a window I guess but
it's<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:21.930> cuz<00:01:22.229> doors<00:01:22.950> close<00:01:23.939> up

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.160 

there<00:01:28.340> now<00:01:28.670> space<00:01:29.000> can't<00:01:29.299> didn't<00:01:29.630> accept<00:01:30.049> a

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
there now space can't didn't accept a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.250 
there now space can't didn't accept a
little<00:01:30.470> crack<00:01:31.119> well<00:01:32.119> meatspace<00:01:32.600> getting<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.170> I

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
little crack well meatspace getting in I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.430

little spin let's go and actually Stern
the<00:03:06.230> items<00:03:06.469> off<00:03:06.650> oh<00:03:06.920> that's<00:03:07.819> beautiful<00:03:08.030> look

the items off oh that's beautiful look

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.179 
the items off oh that's beautiful look
at<00:03:08.810> those<00:03:08.900> frames<00:03:09.349> that<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.680> just<00:03:09.829> get<00:03:10.010> from

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
at those frames that we just get from

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.110 
at those frames that we just get from
that<00:03:10.959> yes<00:03:11.959> all<00:03:12.439> right<00:03:12.620> let's<00:03:12.799> go<00:03:12.920> ahead<00:03:12.980> and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
that yes all right let's go ahead and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.470 
that yes all right let's go ahead and
engines<00:03:14.120> on<00:03:14.269> by<00:03:14.840> frames<00:03:16.060> let's<00:03:17.060> go<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.299> follow

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
engines on by frames let's go and follow

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.349 
engines on by frames let's go and follow
up<00:03:17.629> until<00:03:17.870> fast<00:03:18.079> as<00:03:18.200> n<00:03:18.349> goes<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:19.459> we<00:03:20.090> want<00:03:20.299> to

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
up until fast as n goes so we want to

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.360 
up until fast as n goes so we want to
look<00:03:20.569> at<00:03:20.719> our<00:03:20.840> speed<00:03:21.230> here<00:03:21.530> meters/second

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
look at our speed here meters/second

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.470 
look at our speed here meters/second
let's<00:03:22.609> go<00:03:22.730> oh<00:03:23.379> it<00:03:24.379> kills<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.889> power<00:03:25.099> but<00:03:26.030> it's

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
let's go oh it kills the power but it's

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.020 
let's go oh it kills the power but it's
think<00:03:26.689> it's<00:03:26.810> up<00:03:26.930> speed<00:03:27.200> pretty<00:03:27.409> well<00:03:28.030> it

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
think it's up speed pretty well it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.170 
think it's up speed pretty well it
maneuvers<00:03:29.569> pretty<00:03:29.780> well<00:03:29.930> also<00:03:30.579> side<00:03:31.579> side<00:03:31.879> up

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
maneuvers pretty well also side side up

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.610 
maneuvers pretty well also side side up
now<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:34.489> slows<00:03:35.000> down<00:03:35.079> pretty<00:03:36.079> slow<00:03:36.319> compared

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
now it slows down pretty slow compared

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.890 
now it slows down pretty slow compared
to<00:03:36.709> most<00:03:36.829> ships<00:03:37.040> I've<00:03:37.219> flown<00:03:37.370> but<00:03:38.329> you<00:03:38.810> know

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
to most ships I've flown but you know

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.209 
to most ships I've flown but you know
that's<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.169> little<00:03:39.349> test<00:03:39.530> there<00:03:39.769> we're<00:03:40.069> going

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:40.219 
that's a little test there we're going

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.800 
that's a little test there we're going
to<00:03:40.310> keep<00:03:40.430> on<00:03:40.549> rotating<00:03:40.700> space<00:03:41.269> here<00:03:41.450> because<00:03:41.719> I

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
to keep on rotating space here because I

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.259 
to keep on rotating space here because I
can<00:03:42.069> ok<00:03:43.069> thanks<00:03:43.549> that's<00:03:43.700> pretty<00:03:44.000> much<00:03:44.060> all<00:03:44.209> i
