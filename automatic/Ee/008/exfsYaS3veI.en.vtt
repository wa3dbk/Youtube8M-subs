decrease your plate size that must have

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.819 
decrease your plate size that must have
been<00:03:18.450> done<00:03:18.629> with<00:03:18.810> 30<00:03:19.110> centimeter<00:03:19.590> diameter

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
been done with 30 centimeter diameter

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.710 
been done with 30 centimeter diameter
place<00:03:20.220> church<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.610> 23<00:03:21.090> centimeter<00:03:21.569> diameter

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
place church is 23 centimeter diameter

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.569 
place church is 23 centimeter diameter
place<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.409> decrease<00:03:22.709> your<00:03:22.890> plate<00:03:23.280> size

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
place if you decrease your plate size

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.729 
place if you decrease your plate size
yeah<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.450> automatically<00:03:25.110> are<00:03:25.319> going<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> eat

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
yeah you automatically are going to eat

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.350 
yeah you automatically are going to eat
less<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.489> actually<00:03:26.640> translate<00:03:27.090> in

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
less and this can actually translate in

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.390 
less and this can actually translate in
twenty-five<00:03:27.900> percent<00:03:28.110> less<00:03:28.650> calorie<00:03:29.129> intake

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
twenty-five percent less calorie intake

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.610 
twenty-five percent less calorie intake
which<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.420> translate<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:31.019> all<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.470> year

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
which can translate in all in the year

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.470 
which can translate in all in the year
over<00:03:31.980> five<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.430> fifteen<00:03:32.849> kilograms<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.420> weight

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
over five to fifteen kilograms of weight

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.539 
over five to fifteen kilograms of weight
loss<00:03:33.840> without<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.230> even<00:03:34.379> trying<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.069> the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
loss without you even trying and the

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.309 
loss without you even trying and the
reason<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.660> food<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.200> you

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
reason is that if you see food if you

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.900 
reason is that if you see food if you
see<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> portion<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.069> satisfying<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
see a portion that is satisfying it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.580 
see a portion that is satisfying it
actually<00:03:39.090> will<00:03:39.359> satisfy<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.930> more<00:03:40.319> than<00:03:40.500> if

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
actually will satisfy you more than if

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.530 
actually will satisfy you more than if
you<00:03:40.650> see<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.859> portion<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.540> dissatisfying

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
you see a portion of this dissatisfying

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.640 
you see a portion of this dissatisfying
yeah<00:03:42.840> there's<00:03:43.140> something<00:03:43.319> with<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
yeah there's something with the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.559 
yeah there's something with the
integration<00:03:44.129> of<00:03:44.190> our<00:03:44.370> eyes<00:03:44.670> our<00:03:45.060> taste<00:03:45.450> buds

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
integration of our eyes our taste buds

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.809 
integration of our eyes our taste buds
our<00:03:45.930> brain<00:03:46.319> our<00:03:46.560> stomach<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.700> is

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
our brain our stomach and so on it is

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.910 
our brain our stomach and so on it is
amazing<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.569> just<00:03:48.810> serve<00:03:49.109> on<00:03:49.290> smaller<00:03:49.590> plates

amazing so just serve on smaller plates
if<00:03:50.159> it's<00:03:50.340> more<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.760> tree<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.090> going<00:03:51.239> to

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
if it's more like a tree it's going to

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.910 
if it's more like a tree it's going to
stretch<00:03:51.540> out<00:03:51.720> your<00:03:51.750> melee<00:03:52.140> going<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.470> chew<00:03:52.680> bit

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.960 
the same amount of food on both place
and<00:04:05.220> we<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.430> have<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> look<00:04:05.669> at<00:04:05.790> what<00:04:05.940> that
