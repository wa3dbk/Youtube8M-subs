00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.869
 the fools who continue to engage in the interests of foreign investors 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.949
 Berlin 1 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.079
 This one maddened because at that moment I see the river along 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.509
 Direction see this time as a winner leave that it goes out like that 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.509
 I would never have thought of the Medicis 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250
 in these two games ran better 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 Please enter your address 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.390
 Rebirth rather 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.670
 and not everyone 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 Svet-ake my stomach too loud and loud 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
 that is different now 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 Well that fits optimally German increased 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 but it is a crazy Worzeldorf 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.910
 in this museum wants 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.240
 she can only do that if I have trouble in this all the time 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.440
 year 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.430
 the internet is an important good if all a bit much 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 in the area 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 I'm sorry if they stay and not to do any more weight 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.940
 The result is better yet it is a so-called hers 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.810
 Home for the 80th 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.080
 at the same time he goes from the bhf-bank 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.620
 that's less risky assets in several dogs 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.770
 09 before that but little of it should be from the assembly of the Soviet Union as a full version 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.770
 With 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500
 December in Schwerin 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.500
 at least in the day 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 No wonder her year has not always been a horror 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.319
 not always is not clear 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.599
 now it is not always 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.599
 the rent what is only with Heike Sch 50 Euro 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.439
 we do not try to stem China 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.899
 but both brands do not agree 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.649
 Hamburg ddp 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.709
 Leipzig 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.989
 good ideas 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.989
 Unfortunately, for example, we may also have to find it 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.679
 that's what's important to draw under our nose it's never been said before 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.119
 urban orchestra food 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.699
 in the US wherever they are 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:19.599
 Mixa had it showed that so far is too little known where to do it 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.569
 I could not leave 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.569
 Rheinfelden 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.659
 It is a 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.089
 Of course I think super 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.089
 it looks like the CDU is releasing the Medal of Honor 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.519
 Who cares that is also something to eat and fast 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.950
 We could have used it well when we were traveling with the giant bird 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.189
 but now it is 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.189
 Thank you 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.259
 you can think of the money what 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.059
 I stayed happy 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.349
 for the fiction before I confirm this I understand 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.269
 they have been holding since the 15th 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.999
 good also bad it will soon be dark 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.389
 that she does not forget 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.389
 Greg Joswiak 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.439
 so he was always small what he probably will be occupied in the way like Bern 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.449
 one not quite agree 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.449
 but far too many made docile tracks 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 UW 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.689
 That's good news 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.750
 a chance I would have seen more questions that I am one 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.380
 We have been so long and have not a single highlight we ask 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.379
 what's up they are not usually on 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.409
 and that's not right here 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.749
 otherwise, the stock has the probes 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.749
 that did not happen quite clearly 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.919
 June 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.460
 it's the first time it's time that's all we did 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.069
 Can you tell me some? Let's say ten on three columns 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.249
 Inters Cristian Chivu 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.849
 so he suggests it's already gone 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.339
 I am afraid 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:58.339
 60 the thing is through cars 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.449
 Dominik wants to drive out the leaves 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.020
 maybe it would go to people 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.080
 it's not surprising that you do not have a chance to know you at least three completely 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.770
 great class 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.589
 I looked bezgl 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:25.029
 of course I'm no longer tolerated Roberto did not work out 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:26.930
 at the louder 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.930
 because he is unique 

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.839
 minute 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.289
 Euro 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:12.309
 I have a huge lead of nine percent 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.930
 Mimi 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.339
 Ben 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.460
 would 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:51.710
 find the games 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.710
 Bundesliga 

00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:09.309
 the most confident are 

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:11.589
 I'm always like this
