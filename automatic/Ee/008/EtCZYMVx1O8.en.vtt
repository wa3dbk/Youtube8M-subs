gonna be putting the pole in the center
of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> greenhouse<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.220> snow

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
of the greenhouse here because the snow

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.460 
of the greenhouse here because the snow
is<00:02:08.459> gonna<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.820> coming<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.350> he'll

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
is gonna be coming and I think he'll

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.590 
is gonna be coming and I think he'll
wind<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.830> running<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.250> my<00:02:11.430> electrical<00:02:11.970> down

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
wind up running all my electrical down

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.520 
wind up running all my electrical down
there<00:02:13.130> run<00:02:14.130> my<00:02:14.340> air<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.880> can<00:02:15.299> run<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.630> out<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
there run my air I can run it out on the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.160 
there run my air I can run it out on the
tubing<00:02:16.890> provided<00:02:17.480> they<00:02:18.480> don't<00:02:18.660> get<00:02:18.870> too<00:02:19.019> much

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
tubing provided they don't get too much

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.070 
tubing provided they don't get too much
loss<00:02:19.440> over<00:02:19.769> length<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.459> don't<00:02:21.180> know<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.510> don't

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
loss over length I I don't know I don't

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.720 
loss over length I I don't know I don't
know<00:02:22.170> how<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.470> air<00:02:22.650> will<00:02:22.860> behave<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.489> long

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
know how the air will behave in a long

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.460 
know how the air will behave in a long
line<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> short<00:02:24.690> line<00:02:24.870> whatever<00:02:25.140> we'll

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
line on the short line whatever we'll

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.370 
line on the short line whatever we'll
find<00:02:25.680> out<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.730> anyway<00:02:27.570> yeah<00:02:27.989> are<00:02:28.080> gonna<00:02:28.200> be

these<00:03:05.070> guys<00:03:05.130> out

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
these guys out

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.400 
these guys out
really

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
really

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.390 
really
as<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:10.220> can<00:03:10.400> see<00:03:11.080> they<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.500> seemed<00:03:13.040> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
as you can see they just seemed to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.830 
as you can see they just seemed to
bounce<00:03:13.700> right<00:03:14.390> back<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:16.240> I'm<00:03:17.240> starting<00:03:17.810> to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
bounce right back and I'm starting to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.590 
bounce right back and I'm starting to
wonder<00:03:18.080> now<00:03:18.470> if<00:03:21.040> possibly<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.480> reservoir<00:03:23.480> of

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
wonder now if possibly that reservoir of

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.460 
wonder now if possibly that reservoir of
mine<00:03:23.780> was<00:03:24.020> heating<00:03:24.410> up<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.840> know<00:03:26.990> causing

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
mine was heating up and you know causing

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.200 
mine was heating up and you know causing
me<00:03:27.590> some<00:03:27.740> root<00:03:27.980> problems<00:03:28.460> now<00:03:28.580> I<00:03:28.610> was<00:03:28.910> getting

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
me some root problems now I was getting

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.670 
me some root problems now I was getting
a<00:03:29.270> little<00:03:29.390> bit<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.660> root<00:03:29.840> rot<00:03:30.050> there<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.290> checked

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
a little bit of root rot there I checked

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.200 
a little bit of root rot there I checked
out<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.980> root<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.400> ones<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.760> pulled<00:03:32.000> out

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
out the root so the ones I pulled out

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.640 
out the root so the ones I pulled out
and<00:03:32.980> yeah<00:03:33.980> for<00:03:34.250> sure<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.430> was<00:03:34.700> getting<00:03:34.850> root<00:03:35.150> rot

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
and yeah for sure I was getting root rot

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.600 
and yeah for sure I was getting root rot
so<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.680> think<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:38.480> next<00:03:38.840> time<00:03:39.380> around<00:03:39.590> even<00:03:40.490> in

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
so I think this next time around even in

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.920 
so I think this next time around even in
the<00:03:40.700> Dutch<00:03:40.880> buckets<00:03:41.330> I'm<00:03:41.750> going<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.830> be<00:03:43.930> using

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
the Dutch buckets I'm going to be using

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.440 
the Dutch buckets I'm going to be using
some<00:03:45.230> xym<00:03:45.650> or<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.580> think<00:03:46.790> that's<00:03:47.150> what<00:03:47.300> it's

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
some xym or I think that's what it's

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.640 
some xym or I think that's what it's
called<00:03:47.600> sign<00:03:48.220> anyway<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.460> it's<00:03:50.060> an<00:03:50.210> organic

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
called sign anyway it's it's an organic

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.900 
called sign anyway it's it's an organic
enzyme<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:51.860> helps<00:03:52.040> with<00:03:52.520> that<00:03:52.700> type<00:03:52.880> of

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
enzyme that helps with that type of

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.520 
enzyme that helps with that type of
thing<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:53.180> I'll<00:03:53.420> try<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:54.020> think<00:03:54.440> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
thing so I'll try that I think the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.960 
thing so I'll try that I think the
temperature<00:03:54.950> went<00:03:55.160> up<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.430> here<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.610> little<00:03:55.790> bit

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
temperature went up in here a little bit

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.720 
temperature went up in here a little bit
and<00:03:57.340> besides<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.490> temperature<00:03:58.880> going<00:03:59.090> up

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.880
