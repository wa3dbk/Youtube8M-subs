00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.640 
was a fixed exact same thing he does now
he's<00:04:31.539> like<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.810> want<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.110> make<00:04:32.259> sure<00:04:32.289> it's<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
he's like I want to make sure it's the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.740 
he's like I want to make sure it's the
right<00:04:32.800> movie<00:04:33.190> role<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.520> it's<00:04:33.639> like<00:04:33.819> wow<00:04:34.060> talk

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:38.520 
about not taking a single risk and I
just<00:04:37.750> think<00:04:37.900> John<00:04:38.050> Hammond<00:04:38.259> would<00:04:38.349> have<00:04:38.440> been

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
just think John Hammond would have been

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.899 
just think John Hammond would have been
better<00:04:38.650> off<00:04:38.860> putting<00:04:39.099> on<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.340> cape<00:04:39.580> would<00:04:39.789> she

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
better off putting on a cape would she

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.070 
better off putting on a cape would she
for<00:04:40.180> some<00:04:40.210> reason<00:04:40.599> he<00:04:40.690> was<00:04:40.810> going<00:04:40.990> around

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
for some reason he was going around

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.779 
for some reason he was going around
saying<00:04:41.379> I'm<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.949> too<00:04:42.069> old<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.370> do<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.520> and

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
saying I'm just too old to do that and

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.189 
saying I'm just too old to do that and
I'm<00:04:42.849> like<00:04:42.970> why<00:04:43.120> would<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.300> call<00:04:43.539> yourself<00:04:43.960> too

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
I'm like why would you call yourself too

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:44.999 
I'm like why would you call yourself too
old<00:04:44.379> Jon<00:04:44.650> Hamm

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
old Jon Hamm

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.529

Blind<00:04:50.949> Side<00:04:51.159> did<00:04:51.400> well<00:04:51.580> let's<00:04:51.729> just<00:04:51.909> do<00:04:52.000> the

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
Blind Side did well let's just do the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.240 
Blind Side did well let's just do the
male<00:04:52.270> version<00:04:52.509> of<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:52.960> that's<00:04:53.830> kind<00:04:54.039> of<00:04:54.099> what

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
male version of that that's kind of what

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.149 
male version of that that's kind of what
you<00:04:54.610> seem<00:04:54.909> seem<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.990> have<00:04:56.139> happening<00:04:56.770> here<00:04:57.009> but

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
you seem seem to have happening here but

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.260 
you seem seem to have happening here but
I<00:04:57.220> think<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.550> could<00:04:57.669> have<00:04:57.789> been<00:04:57.879> such<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.060> more

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
I think this could have been such a more

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.080 
I think this could have been such a more
unique<00:04:58.509> fascinating<00:04:59.229> exciting<00:04:59.830> movie<00:05:00.220> that

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
unique fascinating exciting movie that

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.730

showed<00:05:01.300> more<00:05:01.569> they<00:05:01.990> seem<00:05:02.169> to<00:05:02.259> spend<00:05:02.409> a<00:05:02.500> lot<00:05:02.650> of

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
showed more they seem to spend a lot of

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.249 
showed more they seem to spend a lot of
