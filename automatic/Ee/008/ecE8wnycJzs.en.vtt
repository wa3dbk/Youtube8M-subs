00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
into their edges and actually caused

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.450 
into their edges and actually caused
them<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.360> break<00:06:01.690> and<00:06:01.870> snap<00:06:02.080> off<00:06:02.290> so<00:06:02.560> opt<00:06:02.920> for<00:06:03.430> a
