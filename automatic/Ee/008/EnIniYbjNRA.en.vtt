bronzer<00:00:56.370> comes<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
bronzer comes like those and then it's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
bronzer comes like those and then it's
got<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:58.829> ol<00:00:58.980> mirror<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.520> then

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
got you know the big ol mirror and then

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.139 
got you know the big ol mirror and then
look<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.780> gorgeous<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.280> four

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
look how gorgeous that is so it has four

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
look how gorgeous that is so it has four
colors<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.379> i<00:01:04.470> believe<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> formula<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
colors and i believe the formula is the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.660 
colors and i believe the formula is the
same<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.060> their<00:01:06.180> moisturizing<00:01:06.840> bronzer<00:01:07.670> so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
same as their moisturizing bronzer so

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.010 
same as their moisturizing bronzer so
obviously<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> could<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.510> swipe<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
obviously you could do one swipe and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
obviously you could do one swipe and
i'll<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> pretty<00:01:10.799> lights<00:01:11.189> bronzer

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.310 
very well to define your lashes it's
like<00:05:02.040> it's<00:05:03.040> like<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.340> lash<00:05:03.580> blast<00:05:04.180> wand<00:05:04.780> but

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
like it's like the lash blast wand but

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.470 
like it's like the lash blast wand but
smaller<00:05:05.770> so<00:05:06.160> it's<00:05:06.280> not<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.610> jumbo<00:05:07.030> one<00:05:07.240> but

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
smaller so it's not this jumbo one but

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.630 
smaller so it's not this jumbo one but
it's<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.690> same<00:05:07.840> kind<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:08.140> plastic<00:05:08.350> wand<00:05:08.890> so<00:05:09.550> it

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
it's the same kind of plastic wand so it

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.340 
it's the same kind of plastic wand so it
really<00:05:09.790> defines<00:05:10.000> its<00:05:10.540> supposed<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.900> lengthen

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
really defines its supposed to lengthen

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.000 
really defines its supposed to lengthen
defined<00:05:11.740> curl<00:05:12.460> um<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.930> volume<00:05:14.500> eyes<00:05:14.620> your

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
defined curl um and volume eyes your

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.080 
defined curl um and volume eyes your
lashes<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:15.460> it's<00:05:15.580> like<00:05:15.669> a<00:05:15.700> four-in-one

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
lashes so it's like a four-in-one

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.040 
lashes so it's like a four-in-one
effects<00:05:16.660> for<00:05:16.810> me<00:05:16.990> it's<00:05:17.380> like<00:05:17.560> good<00:05:18.430> um<00:05:19.020> like<00:05:20.020> a

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
effects for me it's like good um like a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.110 
effects for me it's like good um like a
little<00:05:20.320> step<00:05:20.560> up<00:05:20.740> from<00:05:20.919> natural<00:05:21.460> volume<00:05:21.940> but

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
little step up from natural volume but

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.330 
little step up from natural volume but
it's<00:05:22.270> not<00:05:22.510> like<00:05:22.750> VaVaVoom<00:05:23.380> like<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.800> have<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.190> do

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
it's not like VaVaVoom like I have to do

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.370 
it's not like VaVaVoom like I have to do

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
it a few coats in order to get it like

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.620

that<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:27.190> they<00:05:27.550> also<00:05:27.700> gave<00:05:27.940> me<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.150> shade

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
that and they also gave me the shade

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.840 
that and they also gave me the shade
matched<00:05:29.440> me<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.890> vital<00:05:30.160> Umi<00:05:30.370> exhaust
