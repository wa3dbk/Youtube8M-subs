corners<00:03:24.950> are<00:03:25.040> pretty<00:03:25.250> nice<00:03:25.340> that's<00:03:25.640> when<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
corners are pretty nice that's when the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.539 
corners are pretty nice that's when the
care<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.150> these<00:03:26.299> corners<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.190> was<00:03:28.310> quick

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549
