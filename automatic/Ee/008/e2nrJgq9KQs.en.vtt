00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
all right you guys like the way that a

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.230 
all right you guys like the way that a
water<00:04:41.380> looks<00:04:41.680> at<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:42.010> I<00:04:42.250> don't<00:04:43.030> like<00:04:43.060> that

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
water looks at this I don't like that

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.580 
water looks at this I don't like that
there's<00:04:43.390> no<00:04:43.450> current<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.080> can<00:04:44.290> ever<00:04:44.410> tell

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
from like floating or not but it's all

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.100 
from like floating or not but it's all
right<00:04:47.590> i<00:04:47.860> might<00:04:48.610> for<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.420> sake<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.720> my<00:04:49.840> wooden

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110

right i might for the sake of my wooden
house<00:04:50.230> my<00:04:50.590> um<00:04:51.000> single-player<00:04:52.000> world<00:04:52.300> i<00:04:52.680> might

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
house my um single-player world i might

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.050 
house my um single-player world i might
just<00:04:55.950> change<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.220> water<00:04:57.400> back<00:04:57.640> i<00:04:57.850> don't<00:04:58.000> know

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
just change the water back i don't know

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.940 
just change the water back i don't know
if<00:04:58.120> there's<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.330> way<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.480> pick<00:04:58.810> like<00:04:59.110> what<00:04:59.500> what

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
if there's a way to pick like what what

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.310 
if there's a way to pick like what what
is<00:05:00.180> what<00:05:01.180> has<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.570> texture<00:05:01.840> pack<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.200> what

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
is what has the texture pack and what

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.680 
is what has the texture pack and what
doesn't<00:05:02.670> there's<00:05:03.670> probably<00:05:04.000> way<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.570> if

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
doesn't there's probably way but if

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.930 
doesn't there's probably way but if
there<00:05:04.960> is<00:05:05.140> i'm<00:05:05.620> going<00:05:05.920> to<00:05:06.010> change<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.790> water

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
there is i'm going to change the water

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.240 
there is i'm going to change the water
back<00:05:07.320> because<00:05:08.320> i<00:05:08.440> like<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.740> when<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:08.950> can<00:05:09.070> see

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
back because i like it when you can see

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.810 
back because i like it when you can see
the<00:05:10.740> textures<00:05:11.740> or<00:05:11.860> whatever<00:05:12.100> it's<00:05:12.220> called<00:05:12.280> or
