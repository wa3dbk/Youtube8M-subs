00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:38.190
 millimeters then on the bottom 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.770

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.320
 LED screen of 15 with 6 inches 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 and with a 0 camera with 3 megapixels 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.390
 that is to say that this computer tells that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.490
 has the built-in microphone and account 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 with bluetooth 3.0 technology 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 the weight of this laptop is just 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.860
 22 kilos and a half quite light the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.300
 true and good let's start a little 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.760
 for the software 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.920
 It has an Intel Core i7 processor 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:40.090
 of 223 gigahertz and 4 cores a 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.500
 8 gb ram and a hard disk of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.470
 500 gigabytes 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.740
 what happens the graphics card is an intel 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.870
 hd graphics 4000 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.870
 It's not very good but it fulfills 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.740
 and the operating system is a windows 7 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.619
 64- bit home premium 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.439
 and this also has a battery of 6 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.250
 cells that lasts about 3 hours 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.250
 three and a half hours 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.360
 and talking about this computer the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.700
 price is about 600 650 euros which is 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.000
 the truth is enough to be a 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.490
 to have an i7 processor and 8 gb of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 ram the truth is that works for me 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.240
