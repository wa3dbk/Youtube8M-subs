00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.390
 you can use the cube when you have 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.880
 teaching volumes for example can pick up 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.510
 a cube you can use only three by three 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.920
 times 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.990
 I think it's cooler if I can use 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.849
 another is also more then just cool 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.670
 take the two for two for example you 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.220
 will put as if we got here from 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.699
 low or even the volume unit 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 so I have height 1 to which is width 1 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.430
 there the length 1 also then that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:39.899
 cube the smaller the volume 1 is a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.480
 public unit that happens to pick you up 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.320
 with this club and build another 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.370
 cube that has the double fault forth the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.920
 double of culture there double of course to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.879
 here also all the dimensions that will 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 happen and how will it get x 2 that had 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.510
 one here now has two 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.340
 It will get very expensive for two again, right? 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 because all these two have two on top 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.799
 also and will be marked by two of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.659
 new because all these four here 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.580
 has back there because he has twice to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.520
 there too 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.810
 right then and the student can see is that it has 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 has eight equal courses 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 even eight times that the little one 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 The same thing you can do 33 is 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.159
 consider one here I do not know and I know how to be 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.340
 one unit is to have a volume one here and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.829
 that's when I get a how that's formed 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.189
 for several courses since it only has 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.530
 Now I'm going to get three for here three. 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.149
 It's three o'clock or it's not going to work. 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.670
 be marked by 3 x 3 again and we 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.710
 if it is only spoken here would be a name 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.119
 will be marked by 30 again because 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.520
 this has to stop 13 39 27 it can 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.310
 until then count the courses have a what not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.039
 You see, it would be what was inside. 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:12.450
 right does not give to me is the yard and that's it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.690
 You can but understanding this is a 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.520
 easy unit thing 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.540
 here 444 something is going to happen 64 nÃ© 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.030
 It's okay if you want, you can use 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.780
 also others that are neither formats 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.240
 of cube and if for example that is the right 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.910
 Portuguese for two and that's how it goes 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.830
 be not to be alone in the cube that is 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.450
 always the same thing then again have 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.600
 a club here would be our 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.580
 unit volume 1 and that's what I did a 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.190
 multiply by sad is that the size 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.800
 of itself is only two up 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.870
 and behind there depth 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.220
 There were three also so three 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.150
 times 39 times 2 18 can you count it going 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.100
 have 18 robustness one thing to catch others 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.830
 formats 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.810
 this one pick up a unit here from 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.680
 clubbing 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.660
 I put three failures up 4 and 23 for 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.750
 So how many courses are you going to have to 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 to tell everything is to do three months 392 4 36 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.800
 huh 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.180
 there you want is not a cube right 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.910
 but all the pieces have the same size 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.640
 so I have here I made three for here 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:36.780
 three to six sixty- four 32396 54 in these 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.780
 which depends on work and also
