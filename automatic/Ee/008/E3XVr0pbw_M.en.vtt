00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
try something different and we're gonna

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.339 
try something different and we're gonna
use<00:00:11.040> copper<00:00:11.490> sulfate<00:00:11.969> aqueous<00:00:12.420> plus<00:00:12.929> em<00:00:13.320> 1

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
use copper sulfate aqueous plus em 1

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.840 
use copper sulfate aqueous plus em 1
yeah<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> resolved

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
yeah so what is going to be the resolved

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.480 
yeah so what is going to be the resolved
that's<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:19.650> 1<00:00:19.859> more<00:00:20.039> than<00:00:20.250> copper

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that's we have about 1 more than copper

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.259 
that's we have about 1 more than copper
sulfate<00:00:21.029> with<00:00:21.689> color<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.760> mean<00:00:23.760> some<00:00:24.000> fresh

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
sulfate with color I mean some fresh

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.009 
sulfate with color I mean some fresh
ammonia<00:00:25.050> point<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.500> molar<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.449> put<00:00:27.449> some<00:00:27.689> in

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
ammonia point one molar I put some in

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.999 
ammonia point one molar I put some in
just<00:00:28.080> green<00:00:28.980> bottles<00:00:30.199> okay<00:00:31.199> let's<00:00:31.590> try<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
just green bottles okay let's try that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.930 
just green bottles okay let's try that
how<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.730> gonna<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.000> okay<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.899> again

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
and this one is the copper sulfate

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.289 
and this one is the copper sulfate
that's<00:01:04.839> what<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.110> color<00:01:05.290> look<00:01:05.560> like

precipitation in some kind okay this is
the<00:02:29.160> second<00:02:29.489> one<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.840> third<00:02:32.420> which<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:34.190> sodium

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
the second one and third which is sodium

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.020 
the second one and third which is sodium
carbonate<00:02:36.660> or<00:02:36.840> Corot<00:02:37.230> acid<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.489> once<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.819> check

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
carbonate or Corot acid and once I check

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.840 
carbonate or Corot acid and once I check
it<00:02:39.150> remember<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.830> produce<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.670> lot<00:02:41.819> of

gas and hissing sound again same thing

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.050 
gas and hissing sound again same thing
with<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.569> solid<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:47.160> that's<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.489> got

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
with the solid and that's what I got

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.920 
with the solid and that's what I got
alright<00:02:49.019> come<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> last<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:51.299> questions
