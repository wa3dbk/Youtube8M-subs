00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello good morning friends welcome to 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.039
 upton blog today we are going to 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.970
 show how to verify because it is slow 

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:10.410
 your laptop 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.240
 as you can see I have many files 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.880
 on top of the desk so that's not the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.840
 main reason may be slow 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.740
 three reasons number one 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.380
 hard drive that presents damage by excess 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.350
 of use that generally whoever fails 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.670
 is to people who use it for autocad or 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.590
 kids who use the laptop to 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.750
 videogames the reason in number 2 is to be 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.460
 slow the operating system by excess 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.809
 use for having a lot of time to be using 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.090
 this operative fact recommended 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.489
 reinstall the laptop approximately 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.650
 every 6 months and even more if they have it 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.650
 lit all day and the number 3 that 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.820
 the one that we are going to show you today 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.040
 for lack of ram memory in fact if 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.650
 we press the control keys to 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:01.030
 delete them appears on the screen 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.360
 as you can see it is a bit slow says 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.710
 administrator 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.600
 d 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 of tasks 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 pressure there 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.640
 and the administers details appear a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.810
 section that says performance press 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.630
 the performance 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.700
 and here you can see the bar 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.310
 performance this machine is 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.750
 running with 1.5 gigas of ram that is 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.750
 until down the processor is 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.220
 running at 1% and this laptop has 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.040
 physically 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.510
 a day and a half were just like 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.150
 can see almost is reaching the limit 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.470
 of the limit of physical memory that 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.830
 have if your physical memory is less than 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.330
 what you are using to process is 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.910
 the reason why your laptop is 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.590
 slow usually laptops that bring 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.100
 md processor that were bought between 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.440
 the 2010 and 2009 that was only in a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.690
 day of ram and that bring windows view are 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.280
 the main laptops that have that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.130
 problem because the windows seen 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.930
 it's a very heavy operating system if 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.340
 they want to correct the problem visit us 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.540
 in laptop and we will give you some solution 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.750
 so that your equipment is working 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.400
 as if it were a terrarium 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 do not look out for our 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.640
 future blogs thank you for following us 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.640
