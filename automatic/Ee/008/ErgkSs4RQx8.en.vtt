00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.970
 We also want a little one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.379
 nice model for the friends of scale 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.380
 hck is watching 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.750
 we got it from rc4 ddr like 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.980
 the americans would say than the four 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.060
 wheel drive and yes it is the terrain 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.180
 with a new body krusa the set 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.529
 and what we always asked how 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.689
 Actually, that's what I'm talking about 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 my americans use the word 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.120
 terrain as the name of a model is yes 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.350
 rather unusual I mean yes you have 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.940
 make an idea how to do that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.500
 but could not pronounce an idea 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 I did some research like this last time 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.860
 exactly the same consideration ok once briefly 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.860
 path 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.719
 what's it called so nice I have there 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.440
 what is prepared 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.739
 who by our American 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 Colleagues relaxing video and there will be 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:29.659
 this question is called the wise 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:29.659
 clarified or used the joggers then 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.460
 again an original packaged package yes 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.290
 not yet looked at what we already 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.439
 Know it is a browser is one 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.439
 browser 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:19.040
 even popular warranty seal like 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:19.040
 always a very nice guide 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.700
 externally something so simple 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.090
 everything just black and white with the whole 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.380
 Part designations become the Baustufen 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:39.500
 photos pointed is ok 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.500
 looks quite nice out of the kal bow 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:59.269
 like a tree 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.269
 Constancy - is improving 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.470
 the interior dashboard with 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.599
 accelerator clutch brake 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.129
 that will be the inner lining of the 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.260
 Doors are also very atypical for 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.680
 American no automatic was not 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:34.760
 automatic car is possible 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:37.459
 Integrate SUV or other 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.510
 so it looks but ever clean 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.730
 packed out of here 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.900
 this is already going to be a serious one 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.810
 that is to say, it looks like aluminum 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.280
 black anodized 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.890
 It's probably the bumper 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.890
 or something that probably does 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.090
 here again then even a 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.519
 couple of customers rush now at the example 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.750
 the windows and the headlights 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:10.329
 fairing steering wheel any small ones 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.489
 unpack part of the wiper 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:18.139
 interesting because here prefabricated 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.609
 then look at the modules okay 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.680
 construction costs on the axes already holds 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.580
 times in border I would I know the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.440
 probably have a stare 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.889
 did not drive through a phoenix 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.470
 Here we have the gear with 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.060
 integrated slipper clutch like it 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.080
 Looks right here can the tension 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.669
 Adjust or modular plug system 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.720
 with over 3 la gear for the medium 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.720
 were still wet small parts 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.800
 then his place 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:09.610
 Let's see what looks like plastic 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.710
 but clearly it is all already 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.410
 worked clean edges heavy 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.580
 quality 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:22.680
 the bore also looks very neat 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.680
 so one is saying typical hartz iv 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:34.960
 ok and here mature the mature one 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.600
 Doing a bit of work well and the 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.900
 rims even in extremely plastic 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.270
 wrapped 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.300
 Here we have made the centerpiece 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.450
 the cruiser also makes the cruiser the 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.020
 then cruiser down the carton 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.020
 we have this mission 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:38.490
 so much to the exit now begins the 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:40.230
 unpainted looks like it's all here 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.760
 seen there are probably then come 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:54.120
 pay and that's right up here 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:55.100
 behind it or that is the content however 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.890
 deep inside me 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.540
 you have to install there and like it 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:04.200
 you can see exactly the roof can 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.200
 You can lose weight if needed 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.630
 even make a convertible out of it 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.620
 for sunny days in gent 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.070
 that is something quite different than 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:20.070
 the right corner would say right 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.930
 this is a model that will go too 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.910
 will not overwhelm you because of 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.170
 Prefabricated construction boom if you have time and 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.500
 that's definitely what it's like 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.330
 a nice thing nice something to tinker 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.120
 and above all, if the result 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.420
 then it looks like it before as the 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.760
 promises then you have a nice 

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.860
 relatively simple built scaler and how 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.390
 the thing then ultimately looks there 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.800
 you see in one of the 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.800
 next editions of grass entity
