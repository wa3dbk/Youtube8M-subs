00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
 do not 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.550
 this is the time of the new video of the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.500
 week being at this time I wanted 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.629
 make them this video you feel of 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.760
 which is a really great video 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.829
 but good carrying the grain of this 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.739
 video let's talk about the one we're going 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.360
 to do and this time we have to make a 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.040
 delicious pizza and seriously 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.230
 I recommend too much and good today 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.480
 I bring this fruit track we are going to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.879
 do us together we will also make a 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.800
 soda that is super delicious and the 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.870
 I really like it a lot with 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.340
 fruit extract and the truth is that 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.739
 for people who like 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.870
 exotic things and the rich things the 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.489
 things that cool you and also that are 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.809
 pretty healthy for people 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.030
 because honestly that's the most 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.340
 important of everything and that is super 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.649
 Super delicious and tasty and with 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.180
 everything and be so low to remove either 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.330
 so you are until I'm to be 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.330
 so 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.170
 neither here 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.200
 the words neither for that tea 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.550
 choking with pizza well 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.390
 let's make this drink so that you 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.590
 pass the food pole down the throat 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.590
 and we start with this video 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.040
 hello are you from excel mailing 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.720
 to begin we will occupy flour 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.720
 prepared frosting and grated coconut 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.320
 we are also going to occupy these delights 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.220
 hard that are the kiwis the pears and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.410
 many but many strawberries 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.890
 first we will put all our strawberries 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.890
 in the blender 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.680
 and then we'll take our frosting and what 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.950
 we will put in a bowl and then grab 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.409
 our strawberry puree and mix it 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.049
 well and put it together and let us have one 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.180
 super delicious yummy consistency and 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.180
 the best thing with the strawberry is better not 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.459
 I tell them super rich to continue 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.170
 here I have my flour ready and I 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.940
 I bought at the supermarket you 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.980
 they just have to put a little bit of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.290
 hot water so that it can make the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.640
 mix remembering you always have 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.500
 have a little flour on hand 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.599
 so that they do not take off very much in 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.819
 the fingers I'm telling you seriously this is 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.620
 too sticky they always have flour 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.870
 at hand and that's going to be super easy 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.269
 to put it in the oven I occupy a mold 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.069
 round if it makes me a little easier 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.349
 you just have to flatten it and that 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.150
 they stay super per super flat to me 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.370
 it was a little hard that if the mass is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.049
 because it's a little bit more than what 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.760
 I should do the truth is very 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.500
 excited because it was my first pizza 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.620
 but to continue with the procedure 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.269
 let's put our oven to warm up to 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.519
 218 degrees Celsius and after this 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.050
 we have to wait 20 minutes for 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.240
 our delicious pizza is ready 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.400
 when we have baked our work 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.710
 of good art if I call him because he is 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.810
 a work of art and the truth that 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.500
 then let's put our frosting 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.610
 prepared with strawberries because that was 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.230
 delicious 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.420
 well, from this you have seen 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.980
 the salty pieces that put cheese 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.290
 then now instead of which we are to 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.360
 put grated coconut that I liked 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.160
 very much as you know with the grated coconut 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.080
 and the truth you know super well then 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.600
 you have seen the pepperoni is that 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.550
 they have the salty pizzas and good 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.830
 where are we going to put some precious strawberries 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.740
 pepperoni and then to put this sweet 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.780
 and this acid together we're going to put a 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.790
 little kiwi bits of kiwi 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.620
 small cutlets then we are going to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.360
 split a piece of pear we're going to 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.060
 slice it into cubes 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.610
 small and then we will integrate them to 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.040
 our pizza to give them that touch 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.410
 and that apple white flavor that to me 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.360
 I like very much clarify is super 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.150
 very delicious this fruit pizza is 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.340
 it requires that I eat you seriously as 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.470
 I did not have that little thing to cut pizza 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.450
 I occupy a knife it makes me very 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.780
 practical you take care of what you have 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.780
 at home 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.479
 to make your own detox suárez 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.669
 you need to cut your fruit into slices 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.800
 preferred in this case occupy strawberry and 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.949
 pear and the truth that I liked a lot 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.229
 this combination to continue we are going to 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.389
 put our fruits in our glasses 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.789
 remember to put all your favorite fruit 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.889
 so that it is completely filled if you 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.169
 you want me I added some seeds 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.759
 chía and I am a complete fan of 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.310
 these seeds really know super 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.470
 rich if you want to add them but the most 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.180
 important is to crush the fruit I do not 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.610
 I had a special object to do it 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.349
 then I chose this disheartening 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.389
 fruits to get all your 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.430
 nutrients and then I put a little bit 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.560
 of ice so that the arito would remain 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.880
 well rich for summer the truth 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.860
 when it is very hot this 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.020
 drink is super delicious then you 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.569
 can put water or soda depends on your 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.400
 likes but I put water in this case 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.440
 I mention that it does not have to be that 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.360
 sweet city but that can be water with 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.280
 Soda and water to make it much more 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.590
 healthy and software because as the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.599
 killer and some mint leaves then for 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.219
 give it that fresh touch and you see that too 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.090
 it is very, very nice and 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.090
 presentation 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.309
