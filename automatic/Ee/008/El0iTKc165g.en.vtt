00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.790
 Gone green as I said and will beat now 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.829
 cn 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:16.070
 The richest hedged so Voigt the last one they stole it game 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.890
 released 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.490
 the proportion is now close to a complete stop 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.520
 Tax Offices can until the 1 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.520
 Vj Gia 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.420
 then that's it 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 Where 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.180
 the reason is your first one now at the move against England 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.310
 1 Avenge a seven-meter false shop 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.450
 yes why they sort 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.360
 I loaded it all for the label but that's how long the label defense game was 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.220
 not helped 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.240
 what the individual plants safe 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.550
 I did not even know from our side everything has to be up and running again 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.989
 I play this advertising medium back to normal 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.220
 Munich is so perfect 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.770
 Schweigert 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 maybe it's the title of the play all year 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 but no 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.470
 you can feel the crisis 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.110
 here, too, everything is running here, this is obviously not 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.090
 hopefully we can put everything above it 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.640
 Gaillard 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 I did not calculate correctly 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 wobbles 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.510
 Wants to score 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.190
 It was only when I was in front 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.500
 a shit list 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 maybe she should have commitment 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 he did not hurt himself 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.939
 they see the stars 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.540
 as a practical is long that that is so psych what is that in humans and that 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.559
 We have signatures together here 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.969
 so why will 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.199
 Wilhelm 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 which turns out to be very dangerous 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.909
 but no matter how different 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.309
 receives 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.509
 and is safe 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.509
 percent 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.519
 further replaced 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.519
 Why 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.109
 Dr 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.679

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.679
 Brussels - with 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:43.779

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.779
 7 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.369
 William 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.369
 to make music 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.559
 which in attractive prices 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.149
 added value 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.979
 May 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.400

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.509
 dpa 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.509

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.949
 Bowl 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.949
 but why does the theater only have silver? 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.490

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.360
 May I be here 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.210
 I think that our young live 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.110
 so Brig is aware of her 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.110

 Animals are allowed this place here and now that we would be so easy 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.169

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.770
 Euro 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.439
 that such must happen 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:19.439
 not important 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.539

 bad thanks to one of the best RPGs 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:47.830
 the role-play as so many from here go the opinions 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.099
 not installed but you still notice 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.449
 We once had a long planned but not better integrated and stuff 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.189
 on and on 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.499
 I have agreed to be in official statements 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.490

 that's a fantastic talent, he's already "something of amateurish 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.509
 Nobody can say when it's done 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.270
 for themselves 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:32.189
 dpa 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:33.159
 Oh, you shit

 «No No No» means 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.129
 But that's good 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:42.020
 unsuccessful 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.830
 this is how Schalke make it possible 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.830

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:00.240
 there is more 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.819
 at first hand 

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.819
 the c offers 

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.199
