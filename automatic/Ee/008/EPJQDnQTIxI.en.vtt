00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.789 
take a closer look at this in a short
while<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.430> then<00:02:05.750> in<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.259> should<00:02:07.619> have

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
while and then in here we should have

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.839 
while and then in here we should have
some<00:02:08.069> extra<00:02:08.520> goodies

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
some extra goodies

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.420 
some extra goodies
I<00:02:09.110> would<00:02:10.110> imagine<00:02:10.200> we've<00:02:10.770> got<00:02:10.979> maybe<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I would imagine we've got maybe a

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.470 
I would imagine we've got maybe a
cabling

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
cabling

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.890 
cabling
let's<00:02:12.599> have<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> look<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:15.269> in<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.629> section

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
let's have a look so in this section

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.610 
let's have a look so in this section
here<00:02:16.080> we've<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.709> got<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.250> pack<00:02:17.580> or

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
here we've just got a pack or

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.839 
here we've just got a pack or
accessories<00:02:19.620> which<00:02:19.799> is<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.129> stand<00:02:20.519> clip

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
accessories which is this stand clip

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.330 
accessories which is this stand clip
that<00:02:21.060> was<00:02:21.180> mentioned<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:22.069> little<00:02:23.069> bit<00:02:23.190> earlier

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
that was mentioned a little bit earlier

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.009 
that was mentioned a little bit earlier
on<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.030> stand<00:02:27.390> clip<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.900> is

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
on so this is the stand clip this is

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.600 
on so this is the stand clip this is
quite<00:02:28.230> useful<00:02:28.409> actually<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:29.099> haven't<00:02:29.340> had<00:02:29.580> one

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
quite useful actually I haven't had one

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.119 
quite useful actually I haven't had one
of<00:02:29.819> these<00:02:29.910> with<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.510> olympus<00:02:31.019> linear<00:02:31.739> PCM

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.250 
of these with the olympus linear PCM
recorders<00:02:32.700> before<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.629> allows<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.110> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
recorders before this allows you to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.229 
recorders before this allows you to
connect<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.099> recorder<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.700> then

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
connect this to the recorder and then

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.420 
connect this to the recorder and then
i'll<00:02:36.420> act<00:02:36.599> as<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> desk<00:02:37.110> stand<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:38.220> sort<00:02:38.400> of

i'll act as a desk stand for sort of

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.699 
i'll act as a desk stand for sort of
interviewing<00:02:39.030> or<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.170> clip<00:02:40.470> this

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
interviewing or you can clip this

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.610 
interviewing or you can clip this
perhaps<00:02:41.280> onto<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.730> microphone<00:02:42.269> stand<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.290> very

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
perhaps onto a microphone stand so very

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.530 
perhaps onto a microphone stand so very
useful<00:02:44.010> little<00:02:44.099> clip<00:02:44.459> nice<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.420> they

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
useful little clip nice that they

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900 
useful little clip nice that they
include<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.340> box

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
include this in the box

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.000 
include this in the box
it's<00:02:48.299> got<00:02:48.450> quite<00:02:48.660> strong<00:02:49.349> sore<00:02:49.739> clip

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
it's got quite strong sore clip

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.479 
it's got quite strong sore clip
mechanism<00:02:50.609> as<00:02:50.730> well<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.530> then<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:53.069> here<00:02:53.310> we

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
mechanism as well and then just here we

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.539 
mechanism as well and then just here we
have<00:02:53.700> got<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.910> USB<00:02:54.540> cable<00:02:54.780> mini<00:02:55.739> USB<00:02:55.920> 2<00:02:56.250> full

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.880 
have got a USB cable mini USB 2 full
size<00:02:56.849> USB<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.780> i'll<00:02:57.989> imagine<00:02:58.410> that's<00:02:58.560> used

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
size USB and i'll imagine that's used

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.240 
size USB and i'll imagine that's used
for<00:02:59.280> charging<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.660> moving<00:03:01.349> sort<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.680> files<00:03:01.950> off

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
for charging or moving sort of files off

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.240 
for charging or moving sort of files off
of<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.489> device<00:03:03.109> so<00:03:04.109> now<00:03:04.200> let's<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.890> look

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
of the device so now let's have a look

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.729 
of the device so now let's have a look
at<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:06.209> recorder<00:03:06.780> itself<00:03:09.079> quite<00:03:10.079> nice<00:03:10.379> weight

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
at the recorder itself quite nice weight

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.830 
at the recorder itself quite nice weight
to<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.010> actually<00:03:11.459> feels<00:03:12.000> very<00:03:12.090> well<00:03:12.599> made<00:03:12.810> so

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
to it actually feels very well made so

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.920 
to it actually feels very well made so
initial<00:03:13.410> impressions<00:03:13.920> are<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.190> doesn't<00:03:14.370> feel

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
initial impressions are it doesn't feel

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.839 
initial impressions are it doesn't feel

I'll go into that in more detail in the
review<00:03:59.099> and<00:03:59.340> then<00:04:00.150> around<00:04:00.299> on<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.629> side

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
review and then around on this side

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.690 
review and then around on this side
we've<00:04:01.139> got<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.410> power<00:04:01.680> switch<00:04:01.950> which<00:04:02.310> we<00:04:02.489> hold

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
we've got a power switch which we hold

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.300 
we've got a power switch which we hold
down<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:03.060> power<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.389> device<00:04:03.660> on<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.200> then<00:04:05.190> we

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
down to power the device on and then we

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.520 
down to power the device on and then we
can<00:04:05.549> put<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.790> up<00:04:05.849> into<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> hold<00:04:06.450> position<00:04:06.959> to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
can put it up into the hold position to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.550 
can put it up into the hold position to
actually<00:04:08.129> stop<00:04:08.690> any<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> buttons<00:04:10.169> being

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
actually stop any of the buttons being

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.490 
actually stop any of the buttons being
pushed<00:04:11.120> now<00:04:12.120> we<00:04:12.449> have<00:04:12.599> got<00:04:12.750> power<00:04:12.959> in<00:04:13.079> this<00:04:13.290> so

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
pushed now we have got power in this so

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.599 
pushed now we have got power in this so
obviously<00:04:13.829> does<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.220> rechargeable

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
obviously does have a rechargeable

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.839 
obviously does have a rechargeable
battery<00:04:14.879> inside<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.590> said<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.190> power<00:04:17.669> up

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
battery inside and it said on power up

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.580 
battery inside and it said on power up
that<00:04:18.030> we're<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.269> quick<00:04:18.510> mode<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.349> gives<00:04:19.500> a

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
that we're in quick mode so it gives a

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.459 
that we're in quick mode so it gives a
sort<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.430> audio<00:04:20.820> feedback<00:04:21.180> as<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.719> what<00:04:21.900> mode

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
sort of audio feedback as to what mode

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:30.140 
sort of audio feedback as to what mode
we're<00:04:22.680> in

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.670 

so<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.479> tune<00:04:31.720> emotes<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.259> can<00:04:32.380> use<00:04:32.530> it

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
so this is a tune emotes you can use it

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.490 
so this is a tune emotes you can use it
as<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:33.069> chromatic<00:04:33.819> tuner<00:04:34.050> I'm<00:04:35.050> just<00:04:35.349> going<00:04:35.470> to

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
as a chromatic tuner I'm just going to

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.320 
as a chromatic tuner I'm just going to
play<00:04:36.009> those<00:04:36.250> back<00:04:36.460> again<00:04:36.759> just<00:04:36.789> so<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.270> you

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
play those back again just so that you

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:50.629 
play those back again just so that you
can<00:04:37.479> hear<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.930> audio<00:04:38.470> feedback<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.280> get

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.400 

so<00:04:51.639> as<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.120> heard<00:04:52.270> there<00:04:52.509> we<00:04:52.660> get<00:04:52.780> some<00:04:52.990> audio

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
so as you heard there we get some audio

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.559 
so as you heard there we get some audio
feedback<00:04:53.740> which<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.340> really<00:04:54.669> nice<00:04:54.789> it's

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
of internal memory but you can obviously

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.110 
of internal memory but you can obviously
extend<00:05:35.530> that<00:05:35.680> memory<00:05:36.009> using<00:05:36.370> that<00:05:36.490> card<00:05:36.759> slot

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
you've got them on file and then a

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.240 
you've got them on file and then a
little<00:05:49.449> push<00:05:49.719> button<00:05:49.870> here<00:05:50.289> and<00:05:50.409> then<00:05:51.070> this

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
little push button here and then this

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.180 
little push button here and then this
reveals<00:05:51.930> that<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.259> doesn't<00:05:53.680> use<00:05:53.740> a
