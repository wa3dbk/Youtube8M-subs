00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
written on my blog the first part is

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.660 
written on my blog the first part is

that it's elimination what you're going
to<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.060> each<00:02:57.299> day<00:02:57.510> you're<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.900> pick

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
to do is each day you're going to pick

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.240 
to do is each day you're going to pick
something<00:02:58.410> different<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:58.980> you're<00:02:59.069> going<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
something different that you're going to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.800 
something different that you're going to
limit<00:02:59.400> from<00:02:59.670> your<00:02:59.819> diet<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.239> one<00:03:00.390> week<00:03:00.599> so

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.970 
overall it's about a seven day detox but
you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.090> make<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.360> shorter<00:03:03.660> or<00:03:03.690> longer<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.739> for

you can make it shorter or longer so for

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.199

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.350 
might choose to give up coffee so that
means<00:03:13.079> day<00:03:13.440> two<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.099> you're<00:03:14.579> no<00:03:15.120> longer

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
means day two and on you're no longer

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.720 
means day two and on you're no longer
having<00:03:15.690> coffee<00:03:15.959> or<00:03:16.319> alcohol<00:03:16.410> day<00:03:17.370> three<00:03:17.639> you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
having coffee or alcohol day three you

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.360 
having coffee or alcohol day three you
might<00:03:17.880> give<00:03:18.060> up<00:03:18.180> dairy<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.069> on<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.340> so

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
might give up dairy so and so on and so

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
might give up dairy so and so on and so
forth<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.750> what<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:21.900> find<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.380> people

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
forth so this is what I find that people

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.410 
forth so this is what I find that people
do<00:03:22.799> well<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.489> because<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.180> little

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
do well with it is because it's a little

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.690 
do well with it is because it's a little
gentler<00:03:24.989> than<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.829> cutting<00:03:26.130> everything<00:03:26.459> out

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
gentler than just cutting everything out

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.430 
gentler than just cutting everything out
I'm<00:03:27.180> actually<00:03:27.450> getting<00:03:27.660> over<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> little<00:03:28.109> cold

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
I'm actually getting over a little cold

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.460 
I'm actually getting over a little cold
right<00:03:28.590> now<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.340> i<00:03:29.970> tried<00:03:30.450> some<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> these<00:03:30.840> some

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
right now and i tried some of these some

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.199 
right now and i tried some of these some
of<00:03:31.500> these<00:03:31.590> cleanse<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.940> was<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> very

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
of these cleanse and it was a very

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.069 
of these cleanse and it was a very
strict<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.109> severe<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.859> i<00:03:35.930> think<00:03:36.930> that's

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
strict and severe and i think that's

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.990 
strict and severe and i think that's
part<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.340> don't<00:03:38.519> want<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.819> just

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
part of it is you don't want to just

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.930 
part of it is you don't want to just
jump<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.799> headfirst<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:41.910> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
jump in headfirst you really with it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.640 
jump in headfirst you really with it
with<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.389> detox<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.959> might<00:03:43.139> want<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.410> go<00:03:43.620> a

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
with a detox you might want to go a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.550 
with a detox you might want to go a
little<00:03:43.799> grudge<00:03:44.099> little<00:03:44.639> more<00:03:44.760> gradual<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:46.109> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
little grudge little more gradual so the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.589 
little grudge little more gradual so the
first<00:03:46.829> part<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.700> elimination<00:03:48.090> you're

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
first part is the elimination you're

first part is the elimination you're
going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> gradually<00:03:49.290> eliminate<00:03:49.500> some<00:03:50.069> of

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
going to gradually eliminate some of

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.250 
going to gradually eliminate some of
these<00:03:50.250> things<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:51.019> don't<00:03:52.019> support

lot of people are asking me about a

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.370 
lot of people are asking me about a
juicer<00:04:54.729> right<00:04:54.910> now<00:04:55.030> I<00:04:55.240> recommend<00:04:55.840> getting<00:04:56.169> a

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
juicer right now I recommend getting a

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.950 
juicer right now I recommend getting a
juicer<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.979> know<00:04:57.790> it's<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.150> big<00:04:58.300> chunk<00:04:58.600> of<00:04:58.720> money

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
juicer I know it's a big chunk of money

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.590 
juicer I know it's a big chunk of money
especially<00:04:59.229> if<00:04:59.590> you've<00:04:59.740> never<00:04:59.889> juice<00:05:00.220> before

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
especially if you've never juice before

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.909 
especially if you've never juice before
