00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.929
 we have here an application from the oil Fulda area 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.439
 She in an oil platform 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.909
 I can with simple 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.909
 not move through the 3d why 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.970
 what they maybe know by the Vettel a Phone the factor only effect n um 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.560
 that is the typical zoom functionality 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.030
 they buzz so out of it so move in through the 3d effect as well 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.830
 it is sucked in with the two fingers 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.020
 Further details are provided by simple that functionalities 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.640
 But I can also look at the ready-made Russians 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 Right mouse click function through a tactic which works longer on the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 Screen is running 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 so I look at the part of this plant 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.750
 but we also see here that one more mistake is visible 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.760
 in which position I move in 3d space this error becomes the medina 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.800
 shown 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.810
 I have a bag function on diesel 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.480
 error message 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.390
 yes, a live stream can show valves can open and close easily 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 with fingers Porsche 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.730
 Go back to the applications the bug is fixed 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.730
 I still want to take a closer look 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 what happened there now 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.150
 that is a mistake of the rounds in the construction sector has occurred 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.919
 Two fingers at the same time on the speedometer signify a pen of Zion 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.319
 I open these functions 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.669
 I just nonsense 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.099
 a second display is opened 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.099
 I have the drill head visible 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.189
 same as philosophy 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.189
 this build head was brought in by percent CRD data import so where 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.829
 It actually has not been any chimera overhead regarding the 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.109
 drawing 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.909
 and can now put the maintenance man in his place in his place 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.909
 to lead 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.479
 can fix the error before 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.479
 the case here a valve which would have to be replaced 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.389
 back in applications 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.889
 Right mouse click 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.689
 how to go back to the 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.329
 the oil rig 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.329
 you can do more functions 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.229
 Foam and for example 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.229
 the device a little closer 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.579
 when the speed changes test fan 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.999
 Pauli as an example can KÃ¶hler
