00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.910
 only friends funny way like here in 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.469
 have already heard live blog 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.059
 We do not really have time here and figure 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.620
 to be looked at from all sides and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 to describe in detail 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.090
 That's why I want you to at least 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.150
 let's show it is now the lg 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.730
 watch the successor technically 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.119
 almost identical to the predecessor's lgt 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 Also offered with Android as the operating system 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.520
 on it and yes one has so one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.490
 Little inspiration from the motor 360 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.710
 leave with the round metal housing 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.450
 However, it seems relatively simple 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.400
 So now I have that easy to say 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.440
 We have that weight I would have 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.730
 so now we do not expect 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.290
 Let's have a look here 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 bit I think that thing is called 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.680
 colo graf or something like that can be found here 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.350
 do not turn the seemingly so tight 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.640
 his 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.699
 So one side we see pretty much 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.100
 dominant switch button rocker as well 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.350
 always in the connection of a digital 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.479
 clock and an analogue an analogue 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.049
 housing one may call it on the 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.090
 back 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.979
 yes we had a long time yet 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.049
 suspected that it may be the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.420
 possibility of a charge so 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.039
 Unfortunately, there is no wireless charging 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.530
 not it's the pin connector again 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.670
 that's already at the predecessor too 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.770
 had led to problems 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.659
 we hope the problem is solved here 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.729
 That was the problem at the time 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.130
 was that so here stress was on 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.869
 and that's why with body welds 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.550
 somehow started to oxidize 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.960
 I think that will contribute to the new 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.789
 did not make the new riots 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.990
 we put you in your little sensor 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.399
 below that will be all 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.659
 probability for the pulse 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.990
 be responsible 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.490
 and yes a high-quality poor I suspect 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.280
 Sometimes it will be something like calfskin 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.600
 be in style and we have now 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.970
 the show is already giving 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.310
 seen that so many watch faces 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.530
 will give that I think times due 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.679
 the design of the watch itself 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.310
 materials he be on an analog basis 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.259
 should 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 otherwise android who is clear that is 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.989
 Of course, every clock is pretty much the same 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.090
 we have a few more funny ones 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.230
 apps seen with the theme of fitness 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.150
 to keep oneself busy 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.910
 otherwise you will know her again 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.820
 repeat as with the lg porta 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.330
 so with the rectangular design we have 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.330
 here too 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.730
 a 1.2 ghz qualcomm snapdragon 400 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.830
 processor battery is a bit bigger 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.660
 Namely 410 milliamp hours 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.180
 Fire was 400 billion per 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.400
 hours and we just want to 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.280
 watch if that is such a demo mode 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.880
 or maybe we can not do any 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.130
 watch faces change a pity 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.140
 In spite of all that, 410 should be day long 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.030
 Let's see if you can 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.370
 maybe on two computers 4.0 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.150
 are also a little more sensors 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.520
 forgive 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.920
 and as I said the big difference is 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.190
 of course the heart rate monitor 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.490
 Heart rate monitor down to the round 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.470
 So what design here with steel 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.490
 stainless steel I can not do it this way 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.980
 define correctly 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.920
 So it feels extremely light 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.720
 not like me now an analog clock 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.800
 would expect or from an analogue 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.270
 would expect 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.830
 well that it should up to this point he also 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.420
 always been there before being here around us 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.340
 forcibly driving out of the hall 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.590
 next guidance more or less 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.510
 we'll definitely be in 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.340
 an interview appointment with lg there again 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.489
 take a closer look and so on 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.320
 few things to the un should be the first 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.170
 impression back that first sufficient 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.300
 you know video as usual on saturday 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.900
 licon and share new in this sense 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.549
 with jackson from android tv teams 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.349
 liked the video did not forget 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.150
 and to act and there may also be 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.980
 via twitter google plus or facebook 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.310
 to share with others also the food 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 to have 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.760
 the healthy one 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.570
 to the healthy one
