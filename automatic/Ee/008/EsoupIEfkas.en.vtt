00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
that so you've got to really make sure

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.780 
that so you've got to really make sure
that<00:00:34.320> all<00:00:34.469> those<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> date<00:00:35.309> this

have installed on your system that

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
have installed on your system that
probably<00:00:42.360> gets<00:00:42.600> neglected<00:00:42.809> by<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.559> of

probably gets neglected by a lot of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.119 
probably gets neglected by a lot of
people<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.879> probably<00:00:45.120> why<00:00:46.129> malware

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
people and this is probably why malware

writers<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.850> actually<00:00:48.180> concentrated<00:00:48.989> their

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
writers have actually concentrated their

writers have actually concentrated their
efforts<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.829> attacking<00:00:50.610> them<00:00:50.940> areas<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.260> let's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
efforts on attacking them areas so let's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.619 
efforts on attacking them areas so let's
look<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> free<00:00:53.039> program<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.879> use<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
look at a free program we can use to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.709 
look at a free program we can use to
actually<00:00:55.430> keep<00:00:56.430> our<00:00:56.610> system<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> date<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
actually keep our system up to date and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.319 
actually keep our system up to date and
one<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.079> called<00:00:58.170> patch<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:58.920> pc<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one of them is called patch my pc it's a

and which ones are up to date now you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.450 
and which ones are up to date now you
can<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.549> scan<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> 89<00:01:13.460> third-party

can actually scan up to 89 third-party

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
can actually scan up to 89 third-party
applications<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.450> program<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.049> one

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
applications with this program in one

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.280 
applications with this program in one
fell<00:01:16.470> swoop<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.549> also<00:01:17.729> does<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> complete

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
fell swoop and it also does a complete

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
fell swoop and it also does a complete
mess<00:01:19.830> update<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.759> those<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.869> fell

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
mess update of all those in one fell

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
mess update of all those in one fell
swoop<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> portable

swoop as well and it's a portable

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
swoop as well and it's a portable
application<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> look<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130

keep them up-to-date what's going to
happen<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> weak<00:02:01.860> point

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
happen is it's going to be a weak point

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.760 
happen is it's going to be a weak point
for<00:02:02.369> malware<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.119> attack<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.619> always

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
for malware to attack so it's always

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.150 
for malware to attack so it's always
advisable<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.430> keep<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.450> date<00:02:07.160> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
advisable to keep these up to date so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
advisable to keep these up to date so
let's<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> look<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> program<00:02:09.539> itself

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
let's have a look at the program itself

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
let's have a look at the program itself
you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.679> said<00:02:10.920> here<00:02:11.160> we've<00:02:11.280> got<00:02:11.310> 94

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you can see it said here we've got 94

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
you can see it said here we've got 94
important<00:02:12.930> updates

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
important updates

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740 
important updates
so<00:02:14.069> if<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.250> clicked<00:02:14.490> on<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.390> will<00:02:15.569> give

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so if I clicked on this this will give

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.290 
so if I clicked on this this will give
me<00:02:15.780> all<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.350> windows<00:02:16.709> updates<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> could

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
me all the windows updates that I could

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.059 
me all the windows updates that I could
actually<00:02:18.450> update<00:02:19.020> as<00:02:19.170> well<00:02:19.350> which<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.680> very

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
these could be installed on the system

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.640 
these could be installed on the system
and<00:02:29.670> their<00:02:29.940> high<00:02:30.120> priority<00:02:30.750> but<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.590> a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
not a little work on this program and I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.090 
not a little work on this program and I
think<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.569> good<00:03:16.230> start<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.800> an<00:03:16.950> awesome

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
think it's a good start and an awesome

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.430 
think it's a good start and an awesome
little<00:03:17.459> program<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.810> would<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.019> pretty

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
little program and it would be pretty

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.830 
little program and it would be pretty
much<00:03:19.590> as<00:03:19.890> time<00:03:20.730> goes<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.299> just<00:03:21.510> gonna<00:03:21.630> bit

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
much as time goes on it's just gonna bit

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.930 
much as time goes on it's just gonna bit
better<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.320> better<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:22.829> let's<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> look
