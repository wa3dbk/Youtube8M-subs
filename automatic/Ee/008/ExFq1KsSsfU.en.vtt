00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
have space alright so going on in here

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.330 
have space alright so going on in here
we're<00:02:33.810> gonna<00:02:33.870> make<00:02:34.019> some<00:02:34.440> space<00:02:34.739> hopefully

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
we're gonna make some space hopefully

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.840 
we're gonna make some space hopefully
our<00:02:35.970> dark<00:02:36.780> habitats<00:02:37.590> are<00:02:37.890> still<00:02:38.250> filled<00:02:38.580> with

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
our dark habitats are still filled with

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:51.470 
our dark habitats are still filled with
some<00:02:39.230> dragons<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.380> can<00:02:40.530> sell

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.449 

alright<00:02:52.480> let's<00:02:52.660> solve<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:52.959> dragon<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:54.160> dark

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
alright let's solve this dragon the dark

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.650 
alright let's solve this dragon the dark
fire<00:02:54.730> dragon<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.300> think<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.599> have<00:02:55.720> double<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.170> ID

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
fire dragon I think we have double of ID

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.900 
fire dragon I think we have double of ID
now<00:02:58.660> let's<00:02:59.349> go<00:02:59.500> back<00:02:59.769> here<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:02.370> place<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.640> into

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
now let's go back here and place it into

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.020 
now let's go back here and place it into
the<00:03:04.090> habitat<00:03:04.629> there<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:06.220> sunset

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
so that's pretty painful we're gonna

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.809 
so that's pretty painful we're gonna
evolve<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.739> second<00:04:03.190> form<00:04:03.430> then<00:04:03.639> we'll

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
evolve it to second form then we'll

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.670 
evolve it to second form then we'll
check<00:04:04.060> out<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.329> second<00:04:04.750> animation<00:04:05.079> there<00:04:05.590> it

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
check out the second animation there it

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.629 
check out the second animation there it
is<00:04:05.799> second<00:04:06.519> form<00:04:06.760> can<00:04:07.060> get<00:04:07.269> out<00:04:07.420> of<00:04:07.510> there

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
is second form can get out of there

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.460 
is second form can get out of there
that's<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.880> size<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.389> the<00:04:10.510> second<00:04:10.959> dragon<00:04:11.170> for

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
that's the size of the second dragon for

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:23.730 
that's the size of the second dragon for
wondering<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:12.540> mean<00:04:13.540> second<00:04:14.139> form
