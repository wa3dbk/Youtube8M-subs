and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.630> close<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.380> box<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:16.980> put<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.040 

now<00:01:46.730> women's<00:01:47.150> brains<00:01:47.330> are<00:01:47.570> very<00:01:47.750> very

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
now women's brains are very very

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.680 
now women's brains are very very
different<00:01:48.170> from<00:01:48.590> s<00:01:48.800> race<00:01:49.120> women's<00:01:50.120> brains<00:01:50.390> are

different from s race women's brains are

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.900 
different from s race women's brains are
made<00:01:50.840> up<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.200> big<00:01:51.470> ball<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.920> wire<00:01:52.280> and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.670 

everything<00:01:55.910> is<00:01:56.420> connected<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.680> everything

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.470 

the<00:02:02.680> car<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.130> Constitution<00:02:03.730> your<00:02:03.880> job<00:02:04.150> and

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
the car of the Constitution your job and

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:16.510 
the car of the Constitution your job and
your<00:02:04.660> kids<00:02:04.900> are<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.320> your<00:02:05.650> mother

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.440 

it's<00:02:17.520> like<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.880> internet<00:02:18.270> superhighway<00:02:20.450> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it's like the internet superhighway and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.840 
it's like the internet superhighway and
it's<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.810> driven<00:02:22.140> by<00:02:22.320> energy<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:23.490> we<00:02:23.640> call

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
it's all driven by energy that we call

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.740 
it's all driven by energy that we call
emotion

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.500 

is<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.830> one<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.400> reasons<00:02:30.970> why<00:02:31.150> women

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
is this one of the reasons why women

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.550 
is this one of the reasons why women
tend<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.680> remember<00:02:33.180> everything<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.750> if

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
tend to remember everything because if

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.490 
tend to remember everything because if
you<00:02:38.740> take<00:02:38.770> an<00:02:39.220> event<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.690> connect<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.200> to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
you take an event and you connect it to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.980 
you take an event and you connect it to
an<00:02:41.590> emotion<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.430> burns<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.240> your<00:02:43.300> memory<00:02:43.780> and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
an emotion it burns in your memory and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.020 
an emotion it burns in your memory and
you<00:02:44.140> can<00:02:44.290> remember<00:02:44.620> forever<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.670> same<00:02:45.880> thing

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you can remember forever the same thing

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.370 
you can remember forever the same thing
happens<00:02:46.330> for<00:02:46.570> men<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.930> just<00:02:47.140> doesn't<00:02:47.290> happen

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
happens for men it just doesn't happen

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.770 
happens for men it just doesn't happen
very<00:02:47.620> often<00:02:47.920> because<00:02:48.400> quite<00:02:48.760> frankly<00:02:48.820> we

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
very often because quite frankly we

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.880 
very often because quite frankly we
don't<00:02:49.930> care

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.190 

women<00:02:57.760> tend<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.600> care<00:02:58.840> about<00:02:59.130> everything<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
women tend to care about everything and

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.750 
women tend to care about everything and
she<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.560> loved

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.660 

ok

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.640

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
now men we have a box in our brain that

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.160 
now men we have a box in our brain that
most<00:03:20.830> women<00:03:20.950> are<00:03:21.190> not<00:03:21.310> aware<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.810> particular
