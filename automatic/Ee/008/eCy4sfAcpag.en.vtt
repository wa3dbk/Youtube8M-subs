00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.560
OK.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.990
You guys this next one is very simple.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.430
It's fun.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.540
It's an good old school step that we're bringing
back.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.230
It's called the Jazz Square.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.230
OK.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.740
So, you're gonna start with your feet together.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
Now, cross your left over your right.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.680
OK.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.720
Now, step back, step side and step forward.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.390
So, if you look down, you'll notice you're
making a square with each foot.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.390
OK.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.450
It's a little square on the floor.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.160
If that's too much for you, then follow along
with me.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.400
Don't look down.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.400
Think less.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.250
Use more down here.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.250
OK.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.800
So, cross, back, side, front.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.500
Cross, back, side, front.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
OK.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Left foot.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.000
Right, left, forward.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.340
Cross, back, side, front.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.800
Cross over.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.220
Now, step away from me.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.620
Side now, towards me.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.490
Back right here.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.509
Side, good.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.530
Cross, side, here.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.530
OK.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.540
Cool.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.670
So, that was pretty simple.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.670
Yes.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.670
Don't let it get complicated.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.350
I'm telling you it's simple because it is.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.920
Don't freak out up here.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.920
OK.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920
It's working your legs.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.009
It's cardio.

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.740
It's also one of those steps that you can
take slow or you can speed it up depending

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.259
upon where you're at in your warm up or in
your workout.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.850
Are you warming up?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.640
Are you cooling down?

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.640
Which ever one.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.359
If you're warming up, go for a faster tempo.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.159
If you're cooling down, slow it down a little
bit.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.159
OK.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.799
So, we're gonna take it slow, then we're gonna
speed it up.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.799
OK.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.049
Cross the left leg over the right.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.259
1, 2, side forward.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.929
1, 2, side.

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.729
Now let's speed it up.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.409
Cross, back, side.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.259
Cross, back and then you keep the arms free.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.259
Good.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.530
Cross, back, side.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.990
Cross, back, side.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.080
You can add the hips.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.000
Cross, back, side.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.930
Cross, back, side.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.370
You can add the upper body.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.630
All right.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.980
You can add the whole body.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.250
Cross, back, side.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.250
OK.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.790
Now, as you see, we've always started with
the left over the right.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.540
Quickly, we're gonna try it to the other side.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.860
First, let's do it slow, then we'll speed
it up.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.860
Jazz Square.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.189
So we go right left foot.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.439
Cross, back, side, forward.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.629
Cross, back, side.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.960
Go right foot.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.250
Cross, back, side, forward.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.190
Cross, back, side, speed it up.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.660
One, back, side.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.310
Cross, back.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.310
Right foot.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.030
Right, left.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.790
Right, left.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.790
Good.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.380
Add your hips or your upper body.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.380
Back.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.380
Right there.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.269
Cross and hold.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.769
OK.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.330
So, you can do it either way.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.520
Crossing over with the left or crossing over
with the right.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.849
Bah, bah, bah.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:29.849
OK.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:30.849
Add them together.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.500
Throw some steps in between.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.500
It's up to you.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.500
All right.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.609
Have fun.
