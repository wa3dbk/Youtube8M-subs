00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 good charm anders welcome again 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.130
 to the channel and welcome a new video 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.820
 guys there I bring you the review of the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.620
 base plate 97 gigabytes x gaming 7 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.030
 well before talking guys I want to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.620
 clarify that this review will be for 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.990
 standard users for people who 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.900
 maybe they want to ride a pc or want 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 let's say buy another motherboard and it 's 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.170
 simply because I'm going to say the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 main characteristics as well as if 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.099
 has shelley capacity or not that in 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 this case if it has and also good 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.340
 a little bit the connectors that you have and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.920
 others so nothing guys we're going to 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.809
 start with the unboxing the content of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 the box is as follows as we will see 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.700
 then the CD comes with the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 drivers the instruction manual and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.390
 also guys come to us on the wires 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 sata that comes to us a total of three 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 cables also comes the trim 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 in order to avoid further dust 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 on our computer and also guys 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 comes a sticker of powered for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.690
 gigabyte of the sata cables come two 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.340
 types to depend on if the distance is 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
 very long very short to know which one we 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.449
 would come better so this really 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.129
 the most important thing to highlight is great 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.170
 on this motherboard is that the connectors 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.909
 audio are bathed in gold which 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.210
 makes the connection and the quality of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.460
 Audio 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.470
 or is very much much better and good 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 As for ports, we can highlight that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.450
 has the ports for keyboard and mouse 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.270
 old has several usb being 2.0 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.580
 3.0 in case we have a device that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.759
 it still does not support usb 3.0 we have 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.860
 connectors dvi hdmi ethernet and good 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.630
 practically this is everything and finally 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
 guys tell you we're going to be 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 raffling together with gigabyte this 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.750
 portable battery for any 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.430
 usb device is to say you have 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.259
 a console which you want to load 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.360
 by usb you can have 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.160
 whatever a mobile that all the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.140
 mobiles are usually charged by usb 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.210
 Well, you can also upload it here 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.649
 a much smaller size battery 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.240
 that the palm of your hand that you can 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.399
 carry in your pocket and it really is very 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.050
 useful especially for people who have 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.580
 a mobile phone in which the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.350
 battery or whatever it is good then it goes
