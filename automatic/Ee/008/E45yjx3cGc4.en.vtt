we were all keeping a fair idea whether
you<00:02:42.760> had<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.970> come<00:02:43.120> into<00:02:43.269> some<00:02:43.420> more<00:02:43.600> fuel<00:02:43.810> was

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
you had to come into some more fuel was

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.430 
you had to come into some more fuel was
it<00:02:44.140> pretty<00:02:44.320> tight<00:02:44.590> yes<00:02:45.550> but<00:02:45.970> then<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.480> thought

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
it pretty tight yes but then I thought

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.590 
it pretty tight yes but then I thought
when<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:47.950> was<00:02:48.190> three<00:02:48.459> or<00:02:48.610> four<00:02:48.640> laps<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> go<00:02:49.360> I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
when it was three or four laps to go I

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.330 
when it was three or four laps to go I
was<00:02:49.840> four<00:02:50.049> seconds<00:02:50.440> off<00:02:50.620> tour<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.130> could

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
was four seconds off tour and I could

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.030 
was four seconds off tour and I could
never<00:02:51.489> catch<00:02:51.760> him<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.180> then<00:02:52.870> backed<00:02:53.200> off<00:02:53.410> so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
never catch him so I then backed off so

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.890 
never catch him so I then backed off so
a<00:02:54.070> lot<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.430> hard<00:02:54.610> work<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:55.060> lot<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.299> flying<00:02:55.570> about

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
a lot of hard work a lot of flying about

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.470 
a lot of hard work a lot of flying about
a<00:02:55.959> lot<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.320> problems<00:02:56.500> with<00:02:56.829> tires<00:02:57.209> yeah<00:02:58.209> but
