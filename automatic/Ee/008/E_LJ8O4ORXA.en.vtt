00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
top this side this time you do add a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.869 
top this side this time you do add a
little<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.340> hair<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:58.609> notice<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> I'm

little bit of hair and notice that I'm

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.020 
little bit of hair and notice that I'm
coming<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.960> diagonal<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.280> each<00:01:02.609> time<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
coming down on a diagonal so each time I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
coming down on a diagonal so each time I
add<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> strand<00:01:03.660> from<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.989> top<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.710> adding<00:01:05.070> it

add a strand from the top I'm adding it
a<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.519> longer<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.510> maybe<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> started<00:01:07.080> out

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
a little longer so maybe it started out

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.690 
a little longer so maybe it started out
about<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.619> inch<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.159> an<00:01:08.280> inch<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
half and now down to two inches continue

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
half and now down to two inches continue
that<00:01:12.000> pattern<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:12.570> crossed<00:01:13.110> till<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.890> get

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that pattern down crossed till you get

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.260 
that pattern down crossed till you get
to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.250> side<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> break<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> nice

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.590 
diagonal and then do a few strands that
aren't<00:01:18.210> french<00:01:18.420> braided<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.810> either<00:01:19.080> side<00:01:20.600> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
upside down on itself

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.060 
upside down on itself
and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.869> regrab<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> strands<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.950> my

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
hair in add a little piece to the top

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.139 
hair in add a little piece to the top
make<00:01:44.040> sure<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.369> smooth<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.850> keep<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
make sure it's smooth and keep that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.539 
make sure it's smooth and keep that
diagonal<00:01:45.540> pattern<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:47.130> strands<00:01:47.399> are

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
diagonal pattern so your strands are

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.510 
diagonal pattern so your strands are
getting<00:01:47.759> longer<00:01:47.939> each<00:01:48.210> time<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:50.340> when

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
getting longer each time and then when

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.960 
getting longer each time and then when
you<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> edge<00:01:51.240> again<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> couple<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
you get to the edge again do a couple of

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.370 
you get to the edge again do a couple of

till the end because then

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.809 
till the end because then
it's<00:02:14.290> how<00:02:14.379> you<00:02:14.440> make<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> curl<00:02:15.099> in<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.550> bottom

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
it's how you make the curl in the bottom

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.900 
it's how you make the curl in the bottom
of<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> turns<00:02:16.510> itself<00:02:16.840> kind<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.230> inside-out

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
of it it turns itself kind of inside-out

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.910 
of it it turns itself kind of inside-out
so<00:02:18.910> braid<00:02:19.569> those<00:02:19.780> last<00:02:20.050> few<00:02:20.230> pieces<00:02:20.440> into<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
so braid those last few pieces into the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.350 
so braid those last few pieces into the
end<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.280> your<00:02:22.030> strand<00:02:22.440> put<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.709> an<00:02:23.860> elastic

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.030 

and<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:32.110> we'll<00:02:32.230> just<00:02:32.349> start<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.709> tug<00:02:32.890> on

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
and then we'll just start to tug on

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.559 
and then we'll just start to tug on
these<00:02:33.220> strands<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:33.910> them<00:02:34.030> nice<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.420> loose

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
these strands to get them nice and loose

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.410 
these strands to get them nice and loose
and<00:02:34.780> symmetrical<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.580> like<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.030> make<00:02:37.390> sure

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
and symmetrical and I like to make sure

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.120 
and symmetrical and I like to make sure
I<00:02:37.599> take<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.080> end<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.470> twist<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.920> underneath

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
I take the end and twist it underneath

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.039 
I take the end and twist it underneath
itself<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.880> gives<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.269> cute<00:02:40.540> spiraled

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
itself so it gives it that cute spiraled

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.910 
itself so it gives it that cute spiraled
effect<00:02:41.380> I'll<00:02:42.040> put<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.370> really<00:02:42.670> large
