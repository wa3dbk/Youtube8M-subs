everyone we meet when we're traveling

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.810 
everyone we meet when we're traveling
everyone<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.829> talked<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> has<00:01:56.369> also<00:01:56.549> been

everyone we talked to has also been
traveling<00:01:57.210> new<00:01:57.360> reports<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.960> from

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
traveling new reports back from

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.929 
traveling new reports back from
conferences<00:01:58.560> they've<00:01:58.979> been<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.399> this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
conferences they've been to this

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.000 
conferences they've been to this
phenomenon<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.719> happening<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> way

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
phenomenon is happening like a way

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.460 
phenomenon is happening like a way
and<00:02:02.100> there's<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.120> wave<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> expansion<00:02:04.380> of

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
and there's a wave of the expansion of

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.110 
and there's a wave of the expansion of
consciousness<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.190> again<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.490> totally<00:02:06.060> agree

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
consciousness and again I totally agree

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.990 
consciousness and again I totally agree
with<00:02:06.450> Dan<00:02:06.630> g'nite<00:02:06.870> representation<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.830> this

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
with Dan g'nite representation of this

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.700 
with Dan g'nite representation of this
that<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.180> powers<00:02:09.540> that<00:02:09.570> be<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:10.080> really

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
that the powers that be are really

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.230 
that the powers that be are really
really<00:02:11.160> worried<00:02:11.700> about<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.060> because

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
really worried about this because

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.580 
really worried about this because
otherwise<00:02:12.540> they<00:02:12.810> wouldn't<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.320> lock

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
otherwise they wouldn't have to lock

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.430 
otherwise they wouldn't have to lock
down<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.950> us<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.310> hard<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.390> why<00:02:15.690> they<00:02:15.720> got

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
down on us so hard this is why they got

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.200 
down on us so hard this is why they got

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
of those things because they've got no

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.590 
of those things because they've got no
other<00:02:36.210> power<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.490> what<00:02:38.760> does<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.150> tell<00:02:39.540> us

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
other power and what does that tell us

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.420 
other power and what does that tell us
about<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.260> limitation<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.920> box<00:02:41.220> are

about the limitation of the box are
there<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.180> love<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.600> David

I characterizes that and for me that
says<00:02:44.760> okay<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.300> agree<00:02:45.570> with<00:02:45.930> them<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:47.280> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
says okay I agree with them that that it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.330 
says okay I agree with them that that it
may<00:02:48.360> get<00:02:48.570> complicated<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.470> may<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.830> really

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
may get complicated it may get really

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.080 
may get complicated it may get really
interesting<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:51.000> may<00:02:51.270> get<00:02:51.510> more<00:02:51.720> difficult<00:02:52.320> um

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
interesting it may get more difficult um

interesting it may get more difficult um
we<00:02:54.090> may<00:02:54.300> have<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.570> kinds<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:57.110> problems<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
we may have all kinds of problems that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.520 
we may have all kinds of problems that
weren't<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.400> that<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.260> haven't

presentation was how he was told by a

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.509 
presentation was how he was told by a
channel<00:03:14.700> 19<00:03:15.209> years<00:03:15.450> ago<00:03:15.800> that<00:03:16.800> one<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.430> the

channel 19 years ago that one of the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.890 
channel 19 years ago that one of the

many things that will happen is his

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.600 
many things that will happen is his
waves<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.320> this<00:03:19.769> wave<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:19.980> consciousness

waves of this wave of consciousness

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.160 
waves of this wave of consciousness
grows<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.360> we<00:03:21.510> need<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.750> organize

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
grows is that we need to organize

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.680 
grows is that we need to organize
ourselves<00:03:22.709> into<00:03:23.430> groups<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:24.209> together

start to crank up and everyone that we

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.780 
start to crank up and everyone that we

it<00:04:29.000> gets<00:04:29.150> better<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:30.350> would<00:04:30.530> agree<00:04:30.740> with

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
it gets better and I would agree with

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.710 
it gets better and I would agree with
that<00:04:31.010> I<00:04:31.400> don't<00:04:31.880> know<00:04:31.940> how<00:04:32.090> bad<00:04:32.300> it's<00:04:32.510> going<00:04:32.660> to

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
that I don't know how bad it's going to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.030 
that I don't know how bad it's going to
be<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:33.110> don't<00:04:33.200> know<00:04:33.410> what<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.620> timeline<00:04:33.860> is

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
be I don't know what the timeline is

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.320 
be I don't know what the timeline is
going<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.340> be<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.639> think<00:04:34.760> it's<00:04:34.970> going<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.180> get

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
going to be I think it's going to get

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.090 
going to be I think it's going to get
tricky<00:04:35.720> it's<00:04:36.350> not<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.620> end<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.860> world

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
tricky it's not the end of the world

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.440 
tricky it's not the end of the world
it's<00:04:37.220> not<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.460> end<00:04:37.490> of<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.669> human<00:04:38.000> race<00:04:38.030> I

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
it's not the end of the human race I

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.060 
it's not the end of the human race I
think<00:04:38.900> it's<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.110> most<00:04:39.260> amazing<00:04:39.620> training

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
think it's the most amazing training

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.620 
think it's the most amazing training
course<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.580> think<00:04:40.729> it's<00:04:40.850> quite<00:04:40.970> tough<00:04:41.300> and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
course and I think it's quite tough and

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.080 
course and I think it's quite tough and
at<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.320> end<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.740> all<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.889> this<00:04:43.070> there's<00:04:43.910> going

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
at the end of all of this there's going

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.310 
at the end of all of this there's going
to<00:04:44.240> be<00:04:44.270> something<00:04:44.600> which<00:04:44.870> we<00:04:45.020> emerged<00:04:45.290> into

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
to be something which we emerged into

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.730 
to be something which we emerged into
which<00:04:45.860> will<00:04:46.100> be<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.430> wonderful<00:04:46.760> new<00:04:47.450> start<00:04:47.840> for

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
which will be a wonderful new start for

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.250 
which will be a wonderful new start for
the<00:04:49.130> human<00:04:49.729> race<00:04:49.760> but<00:04:50.360> between<00:04:50.660> now<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:51.110> then

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
the human race but between now and then

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.840 
the human race but between now and then
and<00:04:51.979> I<00:04:52.070> don't<00:04:52.250> know<00:04:52.310> how<00:04:52.370> long<00:04:52.490> it's<00:04:52.639> going<00:04:52.790> to

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
and I don't know how long it's going to

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.520 
and I don't know how long it's going to
be<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:53.300> don't<00:04:53.479> know<00:04:53.720> whether<00:04:53.930> it's<00:04:54.050> two<00:04:54.320> years

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
be I don't know whether it's two years

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.159 
be I don't know whether it's two years
or<00:04:54.710> three<00:04:54.740> years<00:04:54.950> or<00:04:55.190> ten<00:04:55.430> years<00:04:55.930> but<00:04:56.930> after

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
or three years or ten years but after

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.350 
or three years or ten years but after
that<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.800> think<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:58.490> we<00:04:58.700> will<00:04:58.820> have<00:04:58.880> emerged

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
that I think that we will have emerged

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.120 
that I think that we will have emerged
from<00:04:59.630> all<00:04:59.810> of<00:04:59.960> this<00:05:00.110> there's<00:05:00.680> going<00:05:00.979> to<00:05:01.039> be<00:05:01.070> a

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
from all of this there's going to be a

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.840 
from all of this there's going to be a
fantastic<00:05:01.550> recovery<00:05:02.120> process<00:05:03.039> I<00:05:04.039> want<00:05:04.700> to<00:05:04.760> be

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
fantastic recovery process I want to be

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.070 
fantastic recovery process I want to be
around<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.150> see<00:05:05.270> what<00:05:05.390> happened<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:05.960> that

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
around to see what happened is that

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.700 
around to see what happened is that
really<00:05:06.530> sounds<00:05:06.800> like<00:05:06.890> fun<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:07.220> me<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:08.710> last

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
is saying that he thought the time scale

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.800 
is saying that he thought the time scale
might<00:05:12.650> extend<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:13.070> 20<00:05:13.370> 19<00:05:13.550> he<00:05:14.390> don't<00:05:14.570> buy<00:05:14.750> the
