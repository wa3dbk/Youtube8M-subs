00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay so the let's talk about the Vatican

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.249 
okay so the let's talk about the Vatican
because<00:00:02.970> for<00:00:03.210> most<00:00:03.330> people<00:00:03.510> including<00:00:03.929> myself

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
because for most people including myself

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.800 
because for most people including myself
I<00:00:04.740> I've<00:00:05.460> been<00:00:05.759> studying<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.270> economic

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
I I've been studying the economic

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.040 
I I've been studying the economic
collapse<00:00:07.080> for<00:00:07.500> for<00:00:07.859> almost<00:00:08.069> 10<00:00:08.340> years<00:00:08.370> now<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
collapse for for almost 10 years now and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.110 
collapse for for almost 10 years now and
an<00:00:10.050> Austrian<00:00:10.620> economics<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.490> haven't<00:00:11.910> seen

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
an Austrian economics and I haven't seen

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.730 
an Austrian economics and I haven't seen
too<00:00:12.389> many<00:00:12.420> things<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> Vatican<00:00:13.590> you've

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
too many things on the Vatican you've

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.860 
too many things on the Vatican you've
mentioned<00:00:13.950> them<00:00:14.190> several<00:00:14.490> times<00:00:14.519> well<00:00:15.450> if<00:00:15.690> you

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
mentioned them several times well if you

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.240 
mentioned them several times well if you
could<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.080> introduce<00:00:16.350> people<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.130> just

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
could just introduce people and just

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.290 
could just introduce people and just
kind<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.460> let<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.699> know<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.180> your

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
kind of let them know what is your

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.519 
kind of let them know what is your
overall<00:00:18.630> theory<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> know<00:00:19.320> you've

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
overall theory and I know you've

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.769 
overall theory and I know you've
actually<00:00:19.830> touched<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> lot<00:00:20.490> here<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.539> who

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
actually touched on a lot here but who

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.320 
actually touched on a lot here but who
is<00:00:22.140> who's<00:00:22.619> calling<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> shots<00:00:23.850> at<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
is who's calling the shots at the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.420 
is who's calling the shots at the
Vatican<00:00:24.750> I'm<00:00:25.109> assuming<00:00:25.529> you're<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
Vatican I'm assuming you're it's not the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.179 
Vatican I'm assuming you're it's not the
Pope<00:00:26.960> well<00:00:27.960> there's<00:00:28.439> something<00:00:28.680> called<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
Pope well there's something called the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
Pope well there's something called the
black<00:00:29.490> Pope<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.599> that's<00:00:31.700> that's<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:33.230> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
black Pope but that's that's not the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.490 
black Pope but that's that's not the
ultimate<00:00:34.820> reason<00:00:35.820> why<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:36.660> been<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
ultimate reason why we've been in the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.810 
ultimate reason why we've been in the
fix<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.489> were<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.890> what<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.280> found<00:00:41.550> out

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
fix that were in what we have found out

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.720 
fix that were in what we have found out
and<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.809> sounds<00:00:43.140> implausible<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and this sounds implausible but it is

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.020 
and this sounds implausible but it is
absolutely<00:00:45.600> correct<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.430> fact<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.879> it's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
absolutely correct the fact that it's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.270 
absolutely correct the fact that it's
been<00:00:48.239> held<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> secret<00:00:48.960> doesn't<00:00:49.920> mean<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
been held in secret doesn't mean that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
been held in secret doesn't mean that
it's<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.820> true<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.809> true<00:00:51.840> there's<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it's not true it is true there's a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's not true it is true there's a
second<00:00:53.219> species<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.930> planet<00:00:55.370> they're

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
second species on this planet they're

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
second species on this planet they're
not<00:00:56.539> extraterrestrials<00:00:57.539> they're<00:00:58.109> very<00:00:58.379> much

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
not extraterrestrials they're very much

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.700 
not extraterrestrials they're very much
with<00:00:58.829> us<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.550> made<00:00:59.820> maps<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.320> previous

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
with us they made maps in the previous

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.460 
with us they made maps in the previous
Ice<00:01:01.949> Age<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:03.110> remnants<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> their

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Ice Age the remnants of their

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.399 
Ice Age the remnants of their
civilizations<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.970> over<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> place

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
civilizations are all over the place

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
civilizations are all over the place
a<00:01:07.439> lot<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.340> times<00:01:08.580> along<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> coast<00:01:09.540> its

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
a lot of times along the coast its

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.510 
a lot of times along the coast its
submerged<00:01:10.610> because<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.680> amount<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.340> sea

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
submerged because the amount of the sea

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340 
submerged because the amount of the sea
level<00:01:14.670> has<00:01:14.970> gone<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.210> by<00:01:15.540> four<00:01:15.810> hundred<00:01:15.960> meters

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
level has gone up by four hundred meters

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.030 
level has gone up by four hundred meters
but<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.880> group<00:01:18.210> has<00:01:18.869> large<00:01:19.470> brains

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
but this this group has large brains

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.570 
but this this group has large brains
there<00:01:20.549> they're<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.650> distinct<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.979> Homo

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
there they're very distinct from Homo

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.840 
there they're very distinct from Homo
sapiens<00:01:24.180> their<00:01:24.840> DNA<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.890> different<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
sapiens their DNA is so different that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.300 
sapiens their DNA is so different that
if<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> two<00:01:27.450> species<00:01:27.840> made<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> their

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
if the two species made it their

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.030 
if the two species made it their
offspring<00:01:29.909> would<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.570> infertile<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.890> we

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
offspring would be infertile and we

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.300 
offspring would be infertile and we
noticed<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.729> their<00:01:33.150> DNA<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.900> just

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
noticed because their DNA was just

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.149 
noticed because their DNA was just
tested<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:36.049> stalls<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.530> over<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
tested they have stalls all over the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
tested they have stalls all over the
place<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.659> been<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.140> earth

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
place because they have been on earth

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.160 
place because they have been on earth
with<00:01:40.920> us<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.790> after<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> Ice<00:01:42.479> Age<00:01:42.780> there

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
with us but after the Ice Age there

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.590 
with us but after the Ice Age there
weren't<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.590> many<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:44.040> them<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.390> they've

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
weren't that many of them and so they've

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
weren't that many of them and so they've
been<00:01:45.780> hiding<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> places<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
been hiding and one of the places that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 
been hiding and one of the places that
they've<00:01:47.970> been<00:01:48.149> hiding<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> Vatican

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
they've been hiding is in the Vatican

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.300 
they've been hiding is in the Vatican
that's<00:01:49.950> why<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.850> Vatican<00:01:51.530> are<00:01:52.530> wearing<00:01:53.159> those

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's why the Vatican are wearing those

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.910 
that's why the Vatican are wearing those
meters<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.450> turns<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.500> also

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
meters it turns out that that's also

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.749 
meters it turns out that that's also
what<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> high<00:01:56.549> priests<00:01:56.909> wore<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> early

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
what the high priests wore in the early

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.160 
what the high priests wore in the early
beginnings<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:01.310> Judaism<00:02:02.990> Moses<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.259> actually

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
beginnings of Judaism Moses was actually

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.460 
beginnings of Judaism Moses was actually
Akhenaten<00:02:07.459> who<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> pharaoh<00:02:09.259> they<00:02:10.259> know

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
Akhenaten who was a pharaoh they know

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.730
