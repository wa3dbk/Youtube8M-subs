00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.819 
so I'm gonna start on the corner of his
face<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.229> move<00:02:04.890> down<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.610> past<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.210> center

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
face and move down just past the center

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.109 
face and move down just past the center
so<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.129> he's<00:02:08.280> kind<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.910> said

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so that way he's kind of like I said

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.530 
so that way he's kind of like I said
he's<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.539> smirking<00:02:11.030> all<00:02:12.030> right<00:02:12.239> that's

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
he's kind of smirking all right that's

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.620 
he's kind of smirking all right that's
pretty<00:02:12.690> good

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
pretty good

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.240 
pretty good
then<00:02:14.230> I'm<00:02:14.320> gonna<00:02:14.410> show<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> little<00:02:14.830> bit<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.160> his

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
then I'm gonna show a little bit of his

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.220 
then I'm gonna show a little bit of his
tongue<00:02:15.550> here<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.660> I'm<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:16.840> gonna<00:02:16.960> sketch

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
tongue here so I'm just gonna sketch

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.430 
tongue here so I'm just gonna sketch
that<00:02:17.410> out<00:02:17.470> now<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:17.950> then<00:02:18.100> refine<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.670> later

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
that out now and then refine it later

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.410 
that out now and then refine it later
let's<00:02:20.440> move<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.580> most<00:02:21.790> important

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
let's move on now to the most important

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.070 
let's move on now to the most important
part<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.750> every<00:02:23.200> rabbit<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:24.370> ears<00:02:24.810> now<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:25.960> you

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
part of every rabbit the ears now as you

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.730 
part of every rabbit the ears now as you
might<00:02:26.230> expect

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
might expect

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.530 
might expect
Oswald's<00:02:27.280> ears<00:02:27.490> are<00:02:27.820> kind<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.270> long<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:30.540> as

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
Oswald's ears are kind of long and as

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.110 
Oswald's ears are kind of long and as
you<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.020> see<00:02:32.080> I'm<00:02:32.890> not<00:02:33.280> really<00:02:33.550> going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.850> draw

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
you can see I'm not really going to draw

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.730 
you can see I'm not really going to draw
these<00:02:34.330> symmetrically<00:02:35.230> I'm<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> leave

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
these symmetrically I'm going to leave

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.630 
these symmetrically I'm going to leave
them<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> little<00:02:35.980> bit<00:02:36.340> off<00:02:37.890> after<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.310> think

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
them a little bit off after that I think

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.100 
them a little bit off after that I think
I'm<00:02:39.700> gonna<00:02:39.820> give<00:02:40.030> him<00:02:40.150> kind<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.480> an<00:02:40.600> edge<00:02:40.840> on

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
I'm gonna give him kind of an edge on

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.730 
I'm gonna give him kind of an edge on
top<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.530> his<00:02:41.650> ears<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:43.930> think<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.380> kind

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
top of his ears there I think that kind

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.100 
top of his ears there I think that kind
of<00:02:44.770> reflects<00:02:45.130> his<00:02:45.280> personality<00:02:46.030> nicely<00:02:46.480> and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
of reflects his personality nicely and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.210 
of reflects his personality nicely and
we<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.490> have<00:02:48.520> his<00:02:48.880> whole<00:02:49.060> face<00:02:49.300> sketched<00:02:49.660> out

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
we now have his whole face sketched out

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.440 
we now have his whole face sketched out
now<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.430> those<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:51.850> who<00:02:52.030> are<00:02:52.120> feeling

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
now for those of you who are feeling

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.350 
now for those of you who are feeling
really<00:02:52.720> adventurous<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.400> can<00:02:54.640> follow<00:02:55.180> along

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
really adventurous you can follow along

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.030 
really adventurous you can follow along
as<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:56.110> sketch<00:02:56.770> out<00:02:56.980> his<00:02:57.370> arm<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.620> in

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
as I sketch out his arm so in

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.070 
as I sketch out his arm so in
traditional<00:03:00.220> Disney<00:03:00.820> fashion<00:03:01.600> I'm<00:03:01.750> going<00:03:01.960> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
traditional Disney fashion I'm going to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.500 
traditional Disney fashion I'm going to
draw<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.680> circular<00:03:03.040> shape<00:03:03.490> for<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> hand<00:03:04.240> and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
draw a circular shape for the hand and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.770 
draw a circular shape for the hand and
then<00:03:05.110> work<00:03:05.350> off<00:03:05.560> from<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:07.240> I'm<00:03:07.450> going<00:03:07.660> to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
then work off from that so I'm going to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.160 
then work off from that so I'm going to
sketch<00:03:08.410> out<00:03:08.560> his<00:03:08.740> fingers<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.620 
sketch out his fingers and just like I
did<00:03:11.380> with<00:03:11.530> his<00:03:11.650> ears<00:03:12.040> I'm<00:03:12.310> going<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.120> square

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
did with his ears I'm going to square

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.810 
did with his ears I'm going to square
off<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.290> bottom<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.950> each<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.340> his<00:03:15.400> fingers

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
off the bottom of each of his fingers

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.710 
off the bottom of each of his fingers
just<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.060> give<00:03:16.210> him<00:03:16.270> a<00:03:16.330> little<00:03:16.510> bit<00:03:16.570> more

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
just to give him a little bit more

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.750 
just to give him a little bit more
character<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:18.190> another<00:03:18.460> thing<00:03:18.550> that's

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
character now another thing that's

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.090

Mouse actually if you look back at some

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.290 
Mouse actually if you look back at some
of<00:03:29.680> Mickey's<00:03:30.100> first<00:03:30.400> appearances<00:03:31.090> he

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
of Mickey's first appearances he

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.400 
of Mickey's first appearances he

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.930 
either and there's actually a really
good<00:03:35.050> reason<00:03:35.500> for<00:03:35.710> that<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:36.250> wonder<00:03:36.430> if<00:03:36.610> anybody

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
good reason for that I wonder if anybody

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.000 
good reason for that I wonder if anybody
out<00:03:37.000> there<00:03:37.150> knows<00:03:37.660> what<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:38.110> reason<00:03:38.500> is

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
out there knows what that reason is

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.760
