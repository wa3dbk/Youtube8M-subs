to start for me you know get the initial

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
to start for me you know get the initial
resources<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> start<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.880> well<00:00:15.030> as<00:00:15.089> what

you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.630> them<00:00:15.750> because<00:00:15.990> there's<00:00:16.139> some

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
you can do of them because there's some

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.390 
you can do of them because there's some
really<00:00:16.410> cool<00:00:16.590> things<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.190> no

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
really cool things you can do that no

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.380 
really cool things you can do that no
everyone<00:00:17.640> understands<00:00:18.000> they're<00:00:18.210> bigger

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
everyone understands they're bigger

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.120 
everyone understands they're bigger
they'd<00:00:18.570> cover<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.410> might<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.560> curious<00:00:19.770> why

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
they'd cover so you might be curious why

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.529 
they'd cover so you might be curious why
I'm<00:00:20.279> doing<00:00:20.490> these<00:00:20.580> both<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> same<00:00:21.210> video

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I'm doing these both in the same video

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.230 
I'm doing these both in the same video
it's<00:00:21.779> because<00:00:22.170> they<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.380> actually<00:00:23.279> bombed<00:00:24.119> in

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
it's because they are actually bombed in

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.849 
it's because they are actually bombed in
the<00:00:24.300> exact<00:00:24.660> same<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.170> they<00:00:25.380> gathered<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the exact same way they gathered in the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.019 
the exact same way they gathered in the
same<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.279> there<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.789> don't<00:00:26.939> actually

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
same way there you don't actually

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
same way there you don't actually
collect<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> same<00:00:28.410> way<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.160> only

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
collect in the same way the only

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.529 
collect in the same way the only
difference<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> them

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
difference is what you can do of them

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.669 
difference is what you can do of them
and<00:00:30.720> they<00:00:30.779> also<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.080> similarity<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.650> our

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and they also have similarity to our

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.160 
and they also have similarity to our
crops<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> game<00:00:32.610> week<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.690> there's

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
crops or in the game week and there's

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
crops or in the game week and there's
basically<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:35.190> you're<00:00:35.280> bombing<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.700> already

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
basically if you're bombing we already

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.580 
basically if you're bombing we already
you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.840> know<00:00:36.870> replace<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you can just you know replace it one of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.110 
you can just you know replace it one of
these<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> split<00:00:38.730> bond<00:00:38.940> with

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
these or you can have a split bond with

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
these or you can have a split bond with
wheat<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.050> carrots<00:00:40.469> blood<00:00:40.680> recommend

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
wheat these and carrots blood recommend

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.790 
wheat these and carrots blood recommend
just<00:00:41.250> fine<00:00:41.399> potatoes<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> carrots<00:00:42.270> because

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
just fine potatoes and carrots because

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
just fine potatoes and carrots because
it's<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.850> much<00:00:45.390> better<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.410> like

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's very very much better and more like

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
it's very very much better and more like
just<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.280> way<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.640> against<00:00:48.570> than<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
just this way because against than a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
just this way because against than a
minute<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.200> let's<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.860> right<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.309> how<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
minute so let's go right into how you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.189 
minute so let's go right into how you
stop<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.149> these<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.570> most<00:00:51.750> people<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
stop on these so most people think you

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.170 
stop on these so most people think you
need<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> Nutella<00:00:52.710> 14<00:00:53.280> world<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
need a Nutella 14 world because the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.670 
need a Nutella 14 world because the
easiest<00:00:54.510> way<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.750> start<00:00:54.960> blowing<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
easiest way to start blowing them is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
easiest way to start blowing them is
just<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.010> head<00:00:56.129> over<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.460> an<00:00:56.520> NPC<00:00:56.789> village<00:00:56.820> with

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
just a head over to an NPC village with

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
just a head over to an NPC village with
the<00:00:57.899> update<00:00:58.170> enabled<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.340> goes

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the update enabled and it just goes

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.240 
the update enabled and it just goes
straight<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:00.899> village<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> you'll

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
straight to you know village and you'll

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.770 
straight to you know village and you'll
just<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.460> able<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> find<00:01:02.879> yourself<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.359> carrots

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
just be able to find yourself a carrots

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.250 
just be able to find yourself a carrots
and<00:01:03.899> potatoes

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and potatoes

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
and potatoes
so<00:01:04.350> I'll<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.559> burn<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:04.979> Quinn

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so I'll just burn all these Quinn

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.350 
so I'll just burn all these Quinn
carrots<00:01:06.630> potatoes<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> perhaps<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
carrots potatoes and this is perhaps the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
carrots potatoes and this is perhaps the
easiest<00:01:09.479> way<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.260> 16<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.740> them

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
easiest way because you get 16 of them

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160 
easiest way because you get 16 of them
if<00:01:11.159> your<00:01:11.520> target<00:01:11.729> 14<00:01:12.240> well<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.080> way

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
if your target 14 well this is the way

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.330 
if your target 14 well this is the way
you<00:01:13.229> want<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> be<00:01:13.530> doing<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> means

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you want to be doing it because it means

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
you want to be doing it because it means
you<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.240> head<00:01:15.570> start<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you can just get a head start and get a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
you can just get a head start and get a
sub<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:17.009> significant<00:01:17.490> farm<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.909> straight

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
sub if a significant farm going straight

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
sub if a significant farm going straight
away<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.479> off<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.810> having<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.229> wait<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.740> just

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
away or off and having to wait and just

has the luxury of having a NPC village
in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> world<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.390> happening<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.799> know<00:01:25.890> pilot

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
in the world or happening you know pilot

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.030 
in the world or happening you know pilot
14<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.970> world<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:28.020> actually<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:28.680> things

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
14 a world like actually in there things

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
14 a world like actually in there things
so<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> want<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> stop

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so if this is you and you want to stop

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.630 
so if this is you and you want to stop
on<00:01:31.470> them<00:01:31.619> anyway<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.340> little<00:01:32.520> more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
on them anyway it's a little more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700 
on them anyway it's a little more
difficult<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.170> two<00:01:34.229> percent

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
difficult because it's a two percent

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.429 
difficult because it's a two percent
drop<00:01:34.979> chance<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.060> zombies<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
drop chance on zombies so you have to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.880 
drop chance on zombies so you have to
kill<00:01:37.619> roughly<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.090> I'd<00:01:39.540> say<00:01:39.600> around<00:01:40.470> 50

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
kill roughly you know I'd say around 50

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
kill roughly you know I'd say around 50
zombies<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.579> even<00:01:41.880> half<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> tato<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
zombies to get even half of tato and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080 
zombies to get even half of tato and
yeah<00:01:43.710> once<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.310> carrot<00:01:44.670> potato<00:01:44.729> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
yeah once you have one carrot potato you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.340 
yeah once you have one carrot potato you
can<00:01:45.210> start<00:01:45.479> farming<00:01:45.689> from<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.259> then

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
can start farming from there and then

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
can start farming from there and then
work<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.680> way<00:01:46.799> up<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.220> lots<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> zombies<00:01:48.240> need

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
work your way up so lots of zombies need

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.999 
work your way up so lots of zombies need
to<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.810> killed<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.350> good<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:49.619> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
to be killed but it's good because you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.260 
to be killed but it's good because you
like<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.250> pee<00:01:50.430> anyway<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.909> they're<00:01:51.030> probably

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
like to pee anyway and they're probably

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
like to pee anyway and they're probably
the<00:01:51.450> easiest<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> mouth<00:01:52.259> together<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the easiest at the mouth together so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
the easiest at the mouth together so
yeah<00:01:53.520> work<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.149> killing<00:01:54.420> zombies<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.990> maybe

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
yeah work on killing zombies and maybe

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.569 
yeah work on killing zombies and maybe
find<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> zombie<00:01:55.710> spoon<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.040> something<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
find a zombie spoon or something and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.520 
find a zombie spoon or something and
you'll<00:01:56.880> eventually<00:01:57.149> get<00:01:57.780> carrots<00:01:58.320> or

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you'll eventually get carrots or

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.209 
you'll eventually get carrots or
potatoes<00:01:59.540> it's<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.619> guess<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.100> could

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
potatoes it's a it's I guess you could

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.980 
potatoes it's a it's I guess you could
just<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> zombie<00:02:03.180> farm<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
just have a zombie farm or you can do it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.359 
just have a zombie farm or you can do it
yourself<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.439> you're<00:02:04.680> cool<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
yourself it's you're cool but it's a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
yourself it's you're cool but it's a
fairly<00:02:05.700> difficult<00:02:05.880> we've<00:02:06.119> away<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:07.020> just

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
fairly difficult we've away and I just

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
fairly difficult we've away and I just
recommend<00:02:07.619> finding<00:02:07.979> an<00:02:08.039> empty<00:02:08.129> village<00:02:08.459> if

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
recommend finding an empty village if

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
recommend finding an empty village if
you<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> ten<00:02:09.599> or<00:02:09.690> 40<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.170> yeah<00:02:10.229> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you have one in ten or 40 but yeah so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
it has like eight stages that slowly

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.009 
it has like eight stages that slowly
progress<00:02:56.860> just<00:02:57.580> randomly<00:02:58.000> basically<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
progress just randomly basically and you
