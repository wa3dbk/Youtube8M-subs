00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
much and try to look and feel the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.570 
much and try to look and feel the
resistance<00:01:35.910> I<00:01:36.560> don't<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.920> even<00:01:38.100> need

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
resistance I don't think you even need

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.900 
resistance I don't think you even need
the<00:01:39.000> yet<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.750> don't<00:01:39.900> need<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.290> anymore

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:02:17.040 

that's<00:01:44.910> paper

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:32.380 

it's<00:02:18.050> really<00:02:18.380> hard<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.709> tell<00:02:30.880> what<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:32.209> do

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
it's really hard to tell what you can do

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.430 
it's really hard to tell what you can do
is<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:34.640> tighten<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.209> too<00:02:35.420> much<00:02:35.450> first<00:02:35.959> and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
is you tighten it too much first and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.820 
is you tighten it too much first and
then<00:02:36.819> take<00:02:37.819> you<00:02:38.000> run<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.480> engine<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.260> then

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
then take you run the engine and then

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.250 
then take you run the engine and then
you<00:02:39.950> hear<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.610> hear<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.060> when<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.840> starts

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
you hear you hear and when it starts

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.050 
you hear you hear and when it starts
clicking<00:02:42.950> again<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.370> then<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.610> turn<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.820> in

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
clicking again and then you turn it in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.560 
clicking again and then you turn it in
another<00:02:44.420> half<00:02:44.900> half<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.650> turn<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.030> can<00:02:47.269> do

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
another half half a turn so you can do

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:57.509 
another half half a turn so you can do
should<00:02:48.260> we<00:02:48.320> try<00:02:48.470> now<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.630> rev<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.989> bit

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:11.660

clearly<00:04:07.970> hear<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.240> difference<00:04:08.660> when<00:04:08.780> we<00:04:08.840> turn

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080
