00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
first one is going to be Mike we're

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.570 
first one is going to be Mike we're
going<00:00:11.570> to<00:00:11.630> do<00:00:11.719> that<00:00:11.809> absolute<00:00:12.549> football<00:00:13.549> I

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
going to do that absolute football I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.180 
going to do that absolute football I
think<00:00:13.940> next<00:00:14.119> up<00:00:14.389> was<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.809> topps<00:00:15.080> chrome<00:00:15.410> format

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
think next up was to topps chrome format

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.540 
think next up was to topps chrome format
um<00:00:17.740> after<00:00:18.740> that<00:00:18.860> i'm<00:00:19.039> trying<00:00:19.250> to<00:00:19.310> think<00:00:19.340> the

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
um after that i'm trying to think the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.950 
um after that i'm trying to think the
order<00:00:19.730> which<00:00:19.880> they<00:00:20.029> came<00:00:20.210> in<00:00:20.360> i<00:00:20.450> think<00:00:20.480> from

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
order which they came in i think from

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.800 
order which they came in i think from
them<00:00:21.140> we<00:00:21.350> go<00:00:21.440> to<00:00:21.470> marquee<00:00:22.210> got<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.330> marquee

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
them we go to marquee got the marquee

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.990 
them we go to marquee got the marquee
and<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:24.410> I<00:00:24.440> got<00:00:24.620> a<00:00:24.770> few<00:00:25.040> of<00:00:25.190> those<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:25.550> do<00:00:25.700> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
and so I got a few of those to do and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.240 
and so I got a few of those to do and
then<00:00:26.750> I<00:00:26.840> think<00:00:27.260> after<00:00:27.470> that<00:00:27.770> when<00:00:27.950> it<00:00:28.040> goes<00:00:28.220> to

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
then I think after that when it goes to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.740 
then I think after that when it goes to
the<00:00:28.400> forward<00:00:28.910> limited<00:00:29.270> back<00:00:29.420> there<00:00:29.630> in<00:00:29.720> the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
the forward limited back there in the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.630 
the forward limited back there in the
limited<00:00:30.170> football<00:00:30.530> and<00:00:30.800> then<00:00:31.340> it's<00:00:31.490> going<00:00:31.580> to

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
limited football and then it's going to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.500 
limited football and then it's going to
do<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.940> elite<00:00:32.270> one<00:00:33.050> elite<00:00:33.320> black<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:35.329> see

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
do the elite one elite black so you see

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.569 
do the elite one elite black so you see
some<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:35.870> five<00:00:36.050> years<00:00:36.350> that<00:00:36.649> is<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.219> OEM

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
some of the five years that is the OEM

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.729 
some of the five years that is the OEM
which<00:00:37.789> it<00:00:38.030> which<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:38.749> think<00:00:38.989> they<00:00:39.109> came<00:00:39.320> in<00:00:39.499> so

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
which it which I think they came in so

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.270 
which it which I think they came in so
I'll<00:00:39.829> try<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:39.980> do<00:00:40.159> them<00:00:40.219> in<00:00:40.339> the<00:00:40.370> order<00:00:40.550> that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
I'll try to do them in the order that

00:00:42.280 --> 00:01:06.550 
I'll try to do them in the order that
