00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.250 
well this is an update on those walnut
trees<00:00:08.920> I<00:00:09.160> put<00:00:10.059> out<00:00:10.209> last<00:00:10.450> year<00:00:10.809> then<00:00:10.959> some<00:00:11.200> of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
trees I put out last year then some of

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.280 
trees I put out last year then some of
them<00:00:11.379> I<00:00:11.440> picked<00:00:11.680> up<00:00:11.830> from<00:00:12.629> the<00:00:13.629> volunteer<00:00:14.080> that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
them I picked up from the volunteer that

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.720 
them I picked up from the volunteer that
came<00:00:14.440> in<00:00:14.620> my<00:00:14.650> cat<00:00:15.040> this<00:00:15.219> one<00:00:15.339> here<00:00:15.490> not<00:00:15.669> just

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
came in my cat this one here not just

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.210 
came in my cat this one here not just
too<00:00:16.059> bad<00:00:16.299> it<00:00:16.380> turned<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.529> little<00:00:17.619> brown<00:00:17.980> there<00:00:18.189> I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
too bad it turned a little brown there I

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.350 
too bad it turned a little brown there I
think<00:00:18.400> that's<00:00:18.610> about<00:00:18.789> the<00:00:18.939> way<00:00:19.060> they're<00:00:19.210> going

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
think that's about the way they're going

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.850 
think that's about the way they're going
to<00:00:19.450> do<00:00:19.570> now<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.810> big<00:00:20.320> trees<00:00:20.529> are<00:00:20.619> going<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:20.800> be

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
to do now the big trees are going to be

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.710 
to do now the big trees are going to be
doing<00:00:21.010> that<00:00:21.189> too<00:00:21.400> there's<00:00:22.300> another<00:00:22.539> one<00:00:22.660> over

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
doing that too there's another one over

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.669 
doing that too there's another one over
here<00:00:22.990> they're<00:00:23.800> hard<00:00:24.279> to<00:00:24.340> see<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.720> maybe<00:00:26.529> you

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
here they're hard to see but maybe you

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.560 
here they're hard to see but maybe you
can<00:00:26.800> make<00:00:26.980> it<00:00:27.130> out<00:00:27.310> there<00:00:27.939> right<00:00:28.090> up<00:00:28.240> here<00:00:28.420> the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
can make it out there right up here the

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.870 
can make it out there right up here the
small<00:00:28.840> tree<00:00:29.170> can't<00:00:29.470> tell<00:00:29.740> hardly<00:00:30.189> because

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
small tree can't tell hardly because

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
small tree can't tell hardly because
there's<00:00:31.060> many<00:00:31.300> other<00:00:31.420> trees<00:00:31.630> in<00:00:31.660> there

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
there's many other trees in there

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.049 
there's many other trees in there
there's<00:00:32.650> only<00:00:32.890> been<00:00:33.070> out<00:00:33.250> for<00:00:33.280> I<00:00:33.699> don't<00:00:33.879> know

little<00:01:38.259> tree<00:01:38.469> out<00:01:38.649> here<00:01:38.679> and<00:01:39.549> I<00:01:39.640> thought<00:01:39.819> most

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
little tree out here and I thought most

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.700 
little tree out here and I thought most
of<00:01:40.240> them<00:01:40.329> fell<00:01:40.509> off<00:01:40.689> back<00:01:40.990> here<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.319> month<00:01:41.590> ago

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
of them fell off back here a month ago

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.249 
of them fell off back here a month ago
or<00:01:41.829> whenever<00:01:42.130> all<00:01:42.369> them<00:01:42.490> dipped<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:42.880> heathers

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
or whenever all them dipped in heathers

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.630 
or whenever all them dipped in heathers
there's<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.409> load<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.770> them<00:01:44.859> things<00:01:45.189> on<00:01:45.399> here

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
there's a load of them things on here

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.950 
there's a load of them things on here
that<00:01:45.850> might<00:01:46.030> work<00:01:46.179> out<00:01:46.359> pretty<00:01:46.630> good<00:01:46.780> after

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
that might work out pretty good after

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.620 
that might work out pretty good after
all<00:01:47.229> now<00:01:48.069> these<00:01:48.249> two<00:01:48.549> here<00:01:48.909> they're<00:01:49.420> actually

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
all now these two here they're actually

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.520 
all now these two here they're actually
doing<00:01:49.899> real<00:01:50.229> good

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
doing real good

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.129 
doing real good
that<00:01:50.770> one's<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.270> real<00:01:52.270> healthy-looking<00:01:52.689> one

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
that one's a real healthy-looking one

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.300 
that one's a real healthy-looking one
then<00:01:53.319> of<00:01:53.439> course<00:01:53.619> we<00:01:53.710> got<00:01:53.859> one<00:01:54.069> right<00:01:54.280> over

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
then of course we got one right over

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.020 
then of course we got one right over
here<00:01:54.579> that's<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.799> about<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.369> same<00:01:57.789> way

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
here that's just about the same way

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.239 
here that's just about the same way
those<00:01:58.389> are<00:01:58.539> doing<00:01:58.659> really<00:01:58.899> good<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.380> lost<00:01:59.619> wet

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
those are doing really good we lost wet

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.039 
those are doing really good we lost wet
I<00:02:00.310> think<00:02:00.639> plant<00:02:00.909> eight<00:02:01.090> small<00:02:01.539> trees<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.990> we

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
I think plant eight small trees and we

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.569 
I think plant eight small trees and we
lost<00:02:02.259> one

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
lost one

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.370 
lost one
squirrels<00:02:04.420> might<00:02:04.630> have<00:02:04.719> dug<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.929> up<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.289> what

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
squirrels might have dug it up and what

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.010 
squirrels might have dug it up and what
happened<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.859> but<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.329> we'll<00:02:07.539> go<00:02:07.689> here<00:02:07.869> and

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
happened to it but and we'll go here and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.389 
happened to it but and we'll go here and
look<00:02:08.110> at<00:02:08.200> these<00:02:08.259> other<00:02:08.470> here<00:02:08.740> just<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.009> minute<00:02:09.310> I

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
think we've got a little persimmon tree

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.330 
think we've got a little persimmon tree
right<00:02:11.590> here<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:13.030> small<00:02:13.360> one<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:14.340> it's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
right here it's a small one but it's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.730
