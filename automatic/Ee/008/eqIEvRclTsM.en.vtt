00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
Tai Chi posture and then commence

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.220 
Tai Chi posture and then commence
because<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.040> very<00:02:12.430> very<00:02:12.850> stiff<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.420> you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
because this is very very stiff and you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.630 
because this is very very stiff and you
can<00:02:14.440> probably<00:02:14.709> see<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.100> already

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
