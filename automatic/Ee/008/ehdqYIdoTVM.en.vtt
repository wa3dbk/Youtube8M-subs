00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
combination so this is one I have my bag
that<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> painted<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.340> put<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> regular

that I painted you can put a regular

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
that I painted you can put a regular
hacksaw<00:00:27.660> blade<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> wood<00:00:29.010> blade<00:00:29.279> in

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
hacksaw blade in it or a wood blade in

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
hacksaw blade in it or a wood blade in
it<00:00:43.129> this<00:00:44.129> one's<00:00:44.340> bent<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.149> someone<00:00:45.809> who

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it this one's bent because someone who

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.100 
it this one's bent because someone who
was<00:00:46.170> using<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> who<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.129> inexperienced<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
was using it who was inexperienced and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.549 
was using it who was inexperienced and
they<00:00:49.110> were<00:00:49.230> trying<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.649> force<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.460> so

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
they were trying to force it one way so

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.729 
they were trying to force it one way so
you<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.100> spins<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:55.289> fighting<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
you see that it spins and fighting it

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.720 
you see that it spins and fighting it
what<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> understand<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> no<00:00:59.730> bending<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> back

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
what I understand is no bending it back

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.289 
what I understand is no bending it back
so<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.090> reason<00:01:04.519> it's<00:01:05.519> good<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.970> let<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
so for that reason it's good to let the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.810 
so for that reason it's good to let the
sauce<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> work<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.860> force<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:10.820> my

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
sauce do the work and not force it my

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.990 
sauce do the work and not force it my
friend<00:01:12.180> did<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:15.210> why<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> keep<00:01:17.000> five

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
friend did it and that's why I keep five

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.300 
friend did it and that's why I keep five
extra<00:01:18.540> blades<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.229> bubble<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.740> wishes

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
extra blades of my bubble that wishes

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.310 
extra blades of my bubble that wishes
this<00:01:21.060> walls<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.540> variety<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.110> hacksaw<00:01:22.710> blades

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
this walls are variety of hacksaw blades

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
this walls are variety of hacksaw blades
okay<00:01:25.320> there<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> blade<00:01:27.270> weren't

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
okay there we go so if the blade weren't

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.230 
okay there we go so if the blade weren't
bent<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.549> would<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> straight

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
bent like it is that would be a straight

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:46.260 
bent like it is that would be a straight
cut

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:02:03.279 

hey<00:02:01.119> we<00:02:02.119> go<00:02:02.299> getting<00:02:02.719> at<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.959> dry<00:02:03.229> stuff

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
hey we go getting at the dry stuff

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.779 
hey we go getting at the dry stuff
inside<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.920> about<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.280> size<00:02:07.459> of<00:02:07.700> the

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
inside so this is about the size of the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.350 
inside so this is about the size of the
branch<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.569> would<00:02:08.750> go<00:02:08.929> for<00:02:09.200> stead<00:02:09.920> fall

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
branch that I would go for stead fall

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.930 
branch that I would go for stead fall
wouldn't<00:02:11.360> want<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.599> have<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.780> hack<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.380> down

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
wouldn't want to have to hack it down

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.030 
wouldn't want to have to hack it down
would<00:02:13.940> want<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.269> just<00:02:14.420> break<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.049> then<00:02:15.650> saw

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
would want to just break it and then saw

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.330 
would want to just break it and then saw
it<00:02:16.250> up<00:02:16.720> into<00:02:17.720> manageable<00:02:18.140> sizes<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:21.160> baton<00:02:22.160> it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
it up into manageable sizes and baton it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.970 
it up into manageable sizes and baton it
to<00:02:22.549> get<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.819> dry<00:02:23.150> wood<00:02:23.209> with<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.690> srk<00:02:26.980> it's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
to get it to dry wood with this srk it's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.150 
to get it to dry wood with this srk it's
light<00:02:28.340> enough<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:30.470> not<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> bird<00:02:30.920> Nick

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
light enough that it's not a bird Nick

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.500 
light enough that it's not a bird Nick
hair<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.640> doesn't<00:02:31.910> have<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> great<00:02:32.239> weight

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
hair and doesn't have a great weight

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.860 
hair and doesn't have a great weight
penalty<00:02:35.349> but<00:02:36.349> it's<00:02:36.530> thick<00:02:37.280> enough<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.870> it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
penalty but it's thick enough that it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.190 
penalty but it's thick enough that it
makes<00:02:39.049> an<00:02:39.319> excellent<00:02:39.650> splitting<00:02:40.459> tool<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
makes an excellent splitting tool and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.809 
makes an excellent splitting tool and
it's<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.530> fairly<00:02:45.769> sharp<00:02:46.069> knife<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:46.609> well

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
it's a fairly sharp knife as well

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.539 
it's a fairly sharp knife as well
utility<00:02:47.510> knife

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:06.089 

shockproof<00:02:54.549> handle<00:03:04.829> so<00:03:05.829> that's<00:03:06.010> a

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
shockproof handle so that's a

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.860 
shockproof handle so that's a
combination<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.849> I<00:03:06.939> keep<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.329> my<00:03:07.360> bug-out

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
combination that I keep in my bug-out

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.059 
combination that I keep in my bug-out
bag<00:03:08.280> with<00:03:09.280> extra<00:03:09.730> blades<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.799> painted<00:03:11.799> this<00:03:11.890> one

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
bag with extra blades I painted this one

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.420 
bag with extra blades I painted this one
black<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.549> prefer<00:03:12.879> black<00:03:13.120> myself<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.430> that's

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
black I prefer black myself and that's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.870 
black I prefer black myself and that's
an<00:03:15.670> excellent<00:03:16.060> kit<00:03:16.540> for<00:03:16.840> urban<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:18.870> bushcraft
