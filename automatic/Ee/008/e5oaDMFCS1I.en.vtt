want to start out with and the first

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.990 
want to start out with and the first
step<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.450> basically<00:03:15.750> find<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.560> point<00:03:17.000> you

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
step is to basically find the point you

step is to basically find the point you
can<00:03:18.180> kind<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.389> see<00:03:18.569> here<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.049> part<00:03:19.260> folds

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
can kind of see here this part folds

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.620 
can kind of see here this part folds
under<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.190> bit<00:03:20.340> there<00:03:20.579> but<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.480> see

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
under a little bit there but you see

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.140 
under a little bit there but you see
that<00:03:21.780> corner<00:03:22.519> that's<00:03:23.519> where<00:03:23.790> you're<00:03:23.910> going<00:03:24.060> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
that corner that's where you're going to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150 
that corner that's where you're going to
kind<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.389> start<00:03:24.630> off<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:25.920> it'll

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
kind of start off with and then it'll

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.300 
kind of start off with and then it'll
wrap<00:03:26.430> around<00:03:26.459> here<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.040> come

around it just kind of wraps around and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.620 
around it just kind of wraps around and
connects<00:03:31.829> all<00:03:32.489> right<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.819> got<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.209> side<00:03:33.420> on
