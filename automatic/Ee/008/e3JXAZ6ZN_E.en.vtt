00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.949 
this lens the widest aperture is f/4 it
currently<00:01:10.520> tells<00:01:10.789> me<00:01:10.940> that<00:01:11.060> I'm<00:01:11.209> overexposed

of a second you see there we are indeed
underexposed<00:01:52.690> let's<00:01:53.690> bring<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.200> up<00:01:54.440> a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
underexposed let's bring that up a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.609 
underexposed let's bring that up a
little<00:01:54.679> bit<00:01:54.860> with<00:01:55.099> a<00:01:55.130> faster<00:01:55.700> shutter<00:01:55.880> and

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
little bit with a faster shutter and

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.990 
little bit with a faster shutter and
because<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.860> strong<00:01:58.160> white<00:01:58.459> background

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
because of the strong white background

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.479 
because of the strong white background
I'm<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.989> slightly<00:02:00.349> over<00:02:00.679> expose<00:02:01.250> in

I'm going to slightly over expose in
this<00:02:01.819> case<00:02:02.030> by<00:02:02.239> two-thirds<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.929> stop<00:02:03.250> you'll

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
this case by two-thirds of a stop you'll

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.639 
this case by two-thirds of a stop you'll

additionally<00:02:39.420> overexposed<00:02:40.110> now<00:02:41.209> that's

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
additionally overexposed now that's

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.819 
additionally overexposed now that's
because<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.659> cameras<00:02:42.989> more<00:02:43.140> sensitive<00:02:43.650> at

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
because the cameras more sensitive at

the higher ISO these three things of
exposure<00:02:48.120> triangle<00:02:48.480> work<00:02:48.989> together<00:02:49.670> let's

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
exposure triangle work together let's

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.119 
exposure triangle work together let's
take<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.299> little<00:02:51.390> higher<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:52.129> you'll

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
take that up a little higher and you'll

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.800 
take that up a little higher and you'll
now<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.340> where<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.879> full<00:02:54.180> three<00:02:54.510> stops

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
now see where a full three stops

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.800 
now see where a full three stops
overexposed<00:02:55.609> so<00:02:56.609> if<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.819> was<00:02:56.940> shooting<00:02:57.269> at<00:02:57.359> ISO

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.399 
overexposed so if I was shooting at ISO
1600<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:59.090> would<00:03:00.090> need<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.480> back<00:03:00.930> down<00:03:01.200> the

however in this case rather than

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.130 
however in this case rather than
changing<00:03:14.640> shutter<00:03:14.879> speed<00:03:15.209> I'd<00:03:15.599> be<00:03:15.870> better<00:03:16.049> off

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
changing shutter speed I'd be better off

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.460 
changing shutter speed I'd be better off
reducing<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.950> ISO<00:03:17.599> to<00:03:18.599> have<00:03:18.720> less<00:03:18.930> grain<00:03:19.290> or

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
reducing the ISO to have less grain or

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.129 
reducing the ISO to have less grain or
noise<00:03:19.680> let's<00:03:20.400> keep<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.790> at<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> max<00:03:21.359> of<00:03:21.569> 400

for<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.380> shot<00:03:23.660> I'll<00:03:24.660> leave<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.680> aperture

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
for the shot I'll leave the aperture

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.789 
for the shot I'll leave the aperture
alone<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:26.669> case<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.380> just<00:03:28.380> adjust<00:03:28.709> the

shutter speed here's the balanced
exposure<00:03:32.489> although<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.329> will<00:03:33.510> push<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.939 
gray and a slight overexposure let's go

see<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.579> case<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.090> whites<00:04:00.299> are<00:04:00.510> pretty

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750

I<00:04:03.049> consider<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.230> bit<00:04:04.470> overexposed<00:04:05.629> and<00:04:06.739> so

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
I consider that a bit overexposed and so

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.930 
I consider that a bit overexposed and so
let's<00:04:07.949> back<00:04:08.129> that<00:04:08.190> off<00:04:08.579> slightly<00:04:10.669> let's<00:04:11.669> take

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
let's back that off slightly let's take

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.370 
let's back that off slightly let's take
that<00:04:12.090> -<00:04:12.329> just<00:04:12.510> one<00:04:12.780> stop

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.080 

zoom<00:04:18.380> in<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:22.250> highlights<00:04:22.639> are<00:04:22.790> looking

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
zoom in and the highlights are looking

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.780

good and those mid-tones there's plenty

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.150

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
of information there to recover so

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.360 
of information there to recover so
overall<00:04:28.639> it's<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.210> balance<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.840> two<00:04:30.020> dials

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370
