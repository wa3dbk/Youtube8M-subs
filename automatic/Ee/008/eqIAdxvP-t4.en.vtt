the<00:01:37.110> disconnects<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.130> they<00:01:38.909> could<00:01:39.299> be

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the disconnects and like they could be

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
the disconnects and like they could be
adding<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.259> were<00:01:40.500> online<00:01:40.829> their<00:01:41.310> stats<00:01:41.759> and
