and<00:02:36.590> Eric<00:02:37.220> I'm<00:02:37.400> pretty<00:02:37.850> sure<00:02:38.030> they<00:02:38.180> have<00:02:38.330> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
and Eric I'm pretty sure they have the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
and Eric I'm pretty sure they have the
biggest<00:02:38.660> lot<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.230> all<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.500> them<00:02:39.680> they<00:02:40.070> have

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.820 
biggest lot out of all of them they have
this<00:02:40.430> huge<00:02:40.910> garden<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.739> thought

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
this huge garden and I just thought

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.100 
this huge garden and I just thought
would<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:42.980> nice<00:02:43.280> because<00:02:43.700> Eric<00:02:44.420> owned<00:02:44.660> a

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
would be nice because Eric owned a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.630 
would be nice because Eric owned a
resort<00:02:45.530> I'm<00:02:45.709> pretty<00:02:45.890> sure<00:02:46.070> he<00:02:46.220> was<00:02:46.250> like<00:02:46.489> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
resort I'm pretty sure he was like a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.820 
resort I'm pretty sure he was like a
chef<00:02:47.000> maybe<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.870> garden<00:02:48.140> totally<00:02:48.560> fits

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
chef maybe so the garden totally fits

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.370 
chef maybe so the garden totally fits
and<00:02:49.040> it's<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.120> place<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.720> they<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.350> know

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.390 
retired to and they're relaxing and I
don't<00:02:54.350> know<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.650> thought<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.010> really<00:02:55.190> nice
