and then we can talk about them and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
and then we can talk about them and
compare<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.400> another<00:01:47.400> interesting<00:01:47.940> aspect

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090

help<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.750> tutor<00:01:54.930> who<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> remote<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.220> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
help from a tutor who is remote so for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.740 
help from a tutor who is remote so for
instance<00:01:56.730> Keane<00:01:56.940> could<00:01:57.120> be<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.360> tutor<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
instance Keane could be my tutor and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.390 
instance Keane could be my tutor and
he's<00:01:57.870> got<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.080> math<00:01:58.290> homework<00:01:58.470> worksheet<00:01:59.250> for

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
he's got a math homework worksheet for

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.860 
he's got a math homework worksheet for
me<00:01:59.520> through<00:01:59.730> which<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
me through which I'm going to work and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.070 
me through which I'm going to work and
so<00:02:01.680> I'm<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.860> say<00:02:02.040> 1<00:02:02.220> plus<00:02:02.340> 1<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> 2<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.390> 3

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
so I'm gonna say 1 plus 1 is 2 and 3

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.310 
so I'm gonna say 1 plus 1 is 2 and 3
minus<00:02:04.590> 2<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.860> 1<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.900> see<00:02:07.050> as<00:02:07.170> I'm

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
minus 2 is 1 and you can see as I'm

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.020 
minus 2 is 1 and you can see as I'm
working<00:02:07.470> Keane<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.039> evaluating<00:02:08.519> my<00:02:08.640> work<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
working Keane is evaluating my work and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.809 
working Keane is evaluating my work and
5<00:02:09.209> minus<00:02:09.629> -2<00:02:10.019> is<00:02:10.560> also<00:02:11.069> 3<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
5 minus -2 is also 3 and

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.119 
5 minus -2 is also 3 and
that's<00:02:13.120> actually<00:02:13.659> wrong<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.409> so<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.799> now<00:02:15.099> I

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
that's actually wrong and so I now I

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.830 
that's actually wrong and so I now I
know<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.549> child<00:02:15.969> that<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.239> need<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.480> work<00:02:16.659> on

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
know as a child that I need to work on

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.649 
know as a child that I need to work on
my<00:02:16.989> subtraction<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:18.069> negative<00:02:18.430> numbers<00:02:18.760> so

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
my subtraction of negative numbers so

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.360 
my subtraction of negative numbers so
what<00:02:19.810> we've<00:02:19.959> seen<00:02:20.140> here<00:02:20.469> is<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> luminaire

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370
