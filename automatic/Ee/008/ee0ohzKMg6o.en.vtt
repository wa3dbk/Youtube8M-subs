00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 if you do not need whistled now if you need a backlight remote control 500 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.840
 the speakers in one ear then turn off this video it is just not for you because 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 Today I have headphones in my hands that these all show off just do not need sennheiser 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.740
 gamers headphones are very similar to previous models it is still the same 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.380
 recognizable design only in awesome white color black too you only 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 look at them handsome design foldable and for transportation to them 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.460
 There is such a case from a lot of plastic materials and a metal frame 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.110
 plastic hinges but metal hides under them so it's only on 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.629
 they are kind of flimsy and want I would not drop them on my head sit as if there 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.579
 and there should be no discomfort I didn’t feel even after half a day 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.920
 I sat in them at work headband and ear cushions are very soft and even if you 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.860
 points they still won't crush you here of course the solid five remains 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.360
 Only the question is whether this leather substitute will peel off with time, but we will know it. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.830
 Only if we use them for at least a year the headphones are closed and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.210
 well cut off both external noise from you and your mind from the outside world 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.500
 of the controls here, only the volume control wheel as in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.490
 past models it is quite easy to enter and if you accidentally hit something 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.240
 there will be a loud king the microphone is huge and powerful it can be customized by yourself for 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.830
 account that the middle bends all users say that voice transmission 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.479
 he has a very good one and it’s true that’s how it sounds on the integrated audio card 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 And this is the sound of a voice from an external sound card asus for ru 7 for streams and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.100
 podcasts such a microphone is then turned on and off it just 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.670
 lowered turned on picked up turned off the wire 3 meters in a fabric braid and with 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.690
 Velcro to shorten it I want to say that it makes no sense to spend 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.739
 such a lot of money for these headphones if you are not going to buy discrete 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.390
 the audio card just won’t understand why they’ve given such a sum 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.319
 In the motherboard audi hk such a device and will not give you the opportunity to feel the whole 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.329
 the beauty of the sound which they give out with my asus dwarf in 7 headphones are transformed 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.860
 soft and unobtrusive bass which also envelops your ears and you 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.510
 you feel the vibration from the explosions of the shot of the dog in px or when the helicopters fly by 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.160
 in some battlefield positioning is very good right away 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.470
 clear top and back side right or bottom and left least enemy 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.840
 The movement immediately feels with the fact that the headphones are universal music here 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.730
 also sounds good and not some definite but any genre will be good 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.350
 I will say finally that there are the same design headphones as a geyser and 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.150
 they are called game van they are places of folding design they 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.930
 an open type of cover is not included well and the price is simpler 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.609
 In general, this is one of the coolest headphones for professional gamers 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.310
 yes expensive but you also need to buy an audio card in any way but such things are cheap 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.010
 It will never be worth it but if you want a good sound and excellent 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.380
 positioning then look at sennheiser games 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.970
