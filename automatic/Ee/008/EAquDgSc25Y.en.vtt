00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.350
 tablet explay surfer 801 I will 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.389
 shoot by hand because i still have 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.940
 no tripod I drop a menu and a good one 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.910
 camera but still start this review 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.619
 it was necessary to do began in general it does not matter 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 In general, here is such a box . 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.939
 page is written here brief 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.640
 characteristics of the processor itself and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.369
 other stuff like that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.670
 very weight 355 grams is 8 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.300
 1024 inch tft display 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.680
 Ñ… 768 pixels 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.050
 dual core processor at 1 4 gigahertz 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.670
 frequency rockchip rk 36 3066 gig 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.450
 RAM and 8 gigov built-in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.800
 new appeared astana so in general 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.329
 open the box let's see the package bundle 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.690
 In general , the tablet itself is easy to postpone 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:00.870
 while we open it here then such as 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.619
 so that he is the recipient of resignation here 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.530
 Charging mean there is not a nickname 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.610
 connect to computer usb host by 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.140
 so here comes the headphones 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.680
 standard from explay is not very 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 as well can be a guarantee more 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 I'm such an express card to 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.869
 nothing else okay that's postponing it all 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.869
 before 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 we will remove all this and we will consider actually 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.350
 The tablet itself, in general, this one 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.789
 velor boot and goes so ordinary 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.270
 simple but you can buy more under 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:45.149
 8 inch screen okay look here goes 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.179
 the tablet itself is a camera screen like 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.600
 spoke from 8 inches leads very now 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.890
 consider all of these 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.950
 which are connectors and other 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.009
 But in general, this strip is wai 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.399
 file module goes this if you can see 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.530
 so this hole is a microphone so 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.509
 look now here here it goes 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.140
 microusb to charge and connect to 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.790
 computer 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.660
 here is this micro-sd card slot 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.370
 32 gigabyte 4 I do not remember this connector for 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.739
 headphone 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.760
 three and a half millimeter jack and go 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.540
 oh but what is it not included but its 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.030
 You can buy in any store 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.190
 electronics now go over very 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.190
 the buttons here this is the lock and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.109
 turning on the tablet here is this button 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.569
 This return to the home page is not 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.190
 I think that this button is not needed and what else 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.650
 I liked it on the tablet 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.350
 swing volume control and not at all 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.930
 I use it sometimes sometimes they 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.150
 portray here also how to say fail 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.280
 standing in general here it is go back and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:56.459
 This menu in the general tablet costs android 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.060
 4 1 1 there is a wi-fi screen enough 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.269
 Good bright actually saw probably 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.130
 when I did reviews of games and programs 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.900
 learning everything looks so atypical 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.569
 menu and everything else you gets everything 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.030
 works smoothly 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:17.080
 let's see what we have and settings 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.890
 so let's turn off 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.320
 so actually settings settings too 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.000
 I did not update everything according to the standard of the tablet 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.190
 In general, when to take it in my they 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.960
 did hard reset reset settings here 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.200
 version android 4 1 1 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.890
 merged and nothing focused 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.760
 but tact kinds in general does not matter all 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.490
 the rest is wi-fi 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.020
 there is no 3g here it seems to me that he 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.170
 I do not need to buy a tablet at all 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.970
 for games and applications in general, what else 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.260
 to tell 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.480
 the plan works as fast as i said 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.800
 something dual core processor in general 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.350
 pulls in general all the toys 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.360
 I advise you to buy the price of the tablet now 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:01.240
 is 3990 rubles, well, I bought it for her 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:06.330
 so it turns out I removed at the beginning of March in 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.040
 this year its price was 5990 rubles 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.390
 the tablet for its price is simply better 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.840
 now and then it was cool all 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.570
 ok as you can see everything works well 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.370
 no glitches at all were I think 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.990
 it's better not to clog operational 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.840
 memory because otherwise he will lag 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.910
 there will be glitches not significant but still 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.710
 will slow down the interface too 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.260
 menu now we are all working well 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.510
 how to see because I cleaned 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.570
 RAM in general, all that acting 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.800
 python tablets said oh yes even here 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.200
 aluminium case 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.230
 Only this is a plastic insert in 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.140
 the dynamics of the average back what else 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.450
 the tablet is generally enough for gaming 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.870
 skype talk there 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.460
 video call all ok unlock 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.840
 here it turns out this way we can 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.910
 check the lead we will unlock 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.330
 the tablet 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.100
 then here's the actual camera 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.060
 which is something glitches this she she on 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.630
 0 3 megapixel standard for this not 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.850

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.470
 See show say from the weather 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:26.229
