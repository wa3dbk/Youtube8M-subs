our<00:01:31.740> lesson<00:01:31.979> plan<00:01:32.450> ok<00:01:33.450> next<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.869> i<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
our lesson plan ok next what i want to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.520 
our lesson plan ok next what i want to
do<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.880> guess<00:01:36.420> load<00:01:36.659> some<00:01:36.869> samples<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.439> make

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
do is I guess load some samples and make

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.940 
do is I guess load some samples and make
a<00:01:37.560> beat<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> did<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.970> earlier<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
a beat up so I did this earlier with the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.889 
a beat up so I did this earlier with the
little<00:01:40.950> pencil<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.030> now<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.780> gonna

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
little pencil here and now I'm gonna

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.260 
little pencil here and now I'm gonna
move<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> hand<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> grab

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
move the hand there I'm going to grab

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.230 
move the hand there I'm going to grab
that<00:01:46.130> I'm<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> command<00:01:48.720> X<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:50.240> can

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that I'm going to go to command X I can

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
that I'm going to go to command X I can
get<00:01:51.360> rid<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.020> guess<00:01:52.170> grabbing<00:01:52.560> that's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
get rid of it so I guess grabbing that's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
get rid of it so I guess grabbing that's
obviously<00:01:53.250> grab<00:01:53.549> something<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.000> say<00:01:54.240> let's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
obviously grab something and say let's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.450 
obviously grab something and say let's
go<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> edit<00:01:55.200> right<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.729> cut<00:01:57.439> yep

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
go to edit right here I can do cut yep

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.200 
go to edit right here I can do cut yep
let's<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.790> do<00:01:59.880> something<00:02:00.060> else

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
let's see if we can do something else

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.609 
let's see if we can do something else
grab<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.719> let's<00:02:00.840> go<00:02:00.960> from<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:03.530> can't<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
grab it let's go from here can't do that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.840 
grab it let's go from here can't do that
