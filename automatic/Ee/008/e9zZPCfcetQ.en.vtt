both sides of your animal good for
c-sections<00:00:17.520> good<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:18.000> starting<00:00:18.330> calves<00:00:18.570> good

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
c-sections good for starting calves good

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.090 
c-sections good for starting calves good
for<00:00:19.020> looking<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.380> cows<00:00:19.670> treating<00:00:20.670> others

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
for looking out cows treating others

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.700 
for looking out cows treating others
treating<00:00:23.100> feet<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:24.269> about<00:00:24.449> an<00:00:24.570> 850<00:00:25.289> pound<00:00:25.500> unit

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
treating feet to about an 850 pound unit

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.179 
treating feet to about an 850 pound unit
so<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.160> reasonably<00:00:26.640> movable<00:00:27.920> it's<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so it's reasonably movable it's got the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.120 
so it's reasonably movable it's got the
same<00:00:29.400> self<00:00:29.760> gauge<00:00:29.939> head<00:00:30.179> gate<00:00:30.800> built<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
same self gauge head gate built are the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.740 
same self gauge head gate built are the
same<00:00:32.309> components<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> same<00:00:33.210> jig<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
same components in the same jig as the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840 
same components in the same jig as the
one<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.989> our<00:00:34.190> parallel<00:00:35.190> axis<00:00:35.489> squeeze<00:00:35.700> chute

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
one in our parallel axis squeeze chute

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940 
one in our parallel axis squeeze chute
so<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.210> good<00:00:36.360> stout<00:00:36.600> head<00:00:36.840> gate<00:00:37.050> same

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
so it's a good stout head gate same

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.290 
so it's a good stout head gate same
exact<00:00:38.340> head<00:00:38.520> Gators<00:00:38.820> were<00:00:38.910> used<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
exact head Gators were used on a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.030 
exact head Gators were used on a
traveling<00:00:39.629> pin<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> basically<00:00:40.710> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
traveling pin and what it basically is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.000 
traveling pin and what it basically is
is<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> center<00:00:41.850> part<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.239> our<00:00:42.329> calving<00:00:42.750> pen

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
is the center part of our calving pen

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.170 
is the center part of our calving pen
except<00:00:44.010> instead<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> having<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.789> pen<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
control the cow she's on a floor so she

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
control the cow she's on a floor so she

are<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:54.210> frame<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:55.430> welded<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
are here this frame is welded to the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.090 
are here this frame is welded to the
floor<00:01:57.079> but<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> get<00:01:58.409> something<00:01:58.649> coming<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
floor but if you get something coming in

floor but if you get something coming in
fairly<00:01:59.369> fast<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.729> hitting<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.119> could<00:02:00.270> fall

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
fairly fast and hitting it it could fall

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.359 
fairly fast and hitting it it could fall
to<00:02:00.509> dead<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.409> that's<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.710> these<00:02:01.799> gussets<00:02:02.250> are

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to dead so that's what these gussets are

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.590 
to dead so that's what these gussets are
for<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> make<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> little<00:02:03.360> more<00:02:03.509> rigid<00:02:05.600> the

you<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.410> bit<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.950> squeezing<00:02:11.310> action

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
you do have a bit of a squeezing action

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.510 
you do have a bit of a squeezing action
here

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
here

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.270 
here
there's<00:02:14.520> slots<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> floor<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.160> can

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
actually push you push it in and it'll

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.040 
actually push you push it in and it'll
ratchet<00:02:20.090> its<00:02:21.090> way<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.450> keep<00:02:21.660> your<00:02:21.840> car
