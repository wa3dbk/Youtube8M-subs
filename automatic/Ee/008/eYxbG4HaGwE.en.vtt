scoreboard<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.820> create<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.720> scores<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.860> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
scoreboard to create the scores so that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.179 
scoreboard to create the scores so that
folding<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> super<00:01:12.240> easy<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.860> what<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> do

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
folding is super easy and what you do

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.820 
folding is super easy and what you do
for<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.350> board<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
for that is you can see of this board it

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.999 
for that is you can see of this board it
has<00:01:16.979> all<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:17.310> indentations<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.009> I'm

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
has all these indentations in it and I'm

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.560 
has all these indentations in it and I'm
gonna<00:01:20.130> take<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.400> popsicle<00:01:21.119> stick<00:01:21.330> that's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
gonna take my popsicle stick that's

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.260 
gonna take my popsicle stick that's
going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.930> used<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.340> base<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> fan

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
going to be used as the base of the fan

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
going to be used as the base of the fan
where<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> would<00:01:24.780> hold<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:26.130> where<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
where you would hold it and see where it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670 
where you would hold it and see where it
measures<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.450> looks<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.750> 3/4<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> an

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
measures to so that looks like 3/4 of an

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.010 
measures to so that looks like 3/4 of an
inch<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.100> every<00:01:29.369> 3/4<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> an<00:01:30.270> inch<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.689> need<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
inch so every 3/4 of an inch I need to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
inch so every 3/4 of an inch I need to
make<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> score<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.210> marked<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
make a score so it's all marked on the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.580 
make a score so it's all marked on the
scoreboard<00:01:34.619> you're<00:01:35.430> simply<00:01:36.409> dragging<00:01:37.409> your

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
scoreboard you're simply dragging your

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
board and you still have more lengths of

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.230 
board and you still have more lengths of
paper<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.560> move<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.790> I

a number so I'm gonna have my last ones

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.260 
a number so I'm gonna have my last ones
at<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.730> some

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
at to some

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.420 
at to some
due<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:13.560> three<00:02:13.770> quarters<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> then

get to the end of the piece of paper and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.900 
get to the end of the piece of paper and
then<00:02:27.330> any<00:02:27.540> room<00:02:27.810> left<00:02:28.170> over<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.880> just

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
then any room left over you can just

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.610 
then any room left over you can just
trim<00:02:30.780> off<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.820> then<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.090> done<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:34.440> all

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
trim off and then when I'm done it's all

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.530 
trim off and then when I'm done it's all
scored<00:02:35.130> I'm<00:02:35.580> gonna<00:02:35.760> fold<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:38.010> that

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
scored I'm gonna fold it and to do that

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.950 
scored I'm gonna fold it and to do that
because<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.690> those<00:02:40.130> nice<00:02:41.130> scores<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:42.750> can

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
because of those nice scores you can

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.600 
because of those nice scores you can
really<00:02:43.560> fold<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.250> very<00:02:44.880> fast<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.280> makes

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
really fold it very fast so this makes

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.830 
really fold it very fast so this makes
making<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.270> bunch<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.660> these<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.400> lot<00:02:50.400> easier<00:02:50.880> so

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
making a bunch of these a lot easier so

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.500 
making a bunch of these a lot easier so
you<00:02:51.930> can<00:02:52.080> see<00:02:52.320> there<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.190> nice<00:02:53.510> accordion

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
you can see there have a nice accordion

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.770 
you can see there have a nice accordion
folded<00:02:55.170> piece<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.410> paper<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:56.970> have<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.540> paper

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
folded piece of paper so I have my paper

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.920 
folded piece of paper so I have my paper
here<00:02:58.140> it's<00:02:58.290> all<00:02:58.440> scored<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.370> I've<00:02:59.930> accordion

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
here it's all scored and I've accordion

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.130 
here it's all scored and I've accordion
folded<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.500> but<00:03:01.950> it's<00:03:02.100> not<00:03:02.310> quite<00:03:02.700> long<00:03:02.970> enough

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
folded it but it's not quite long enough

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.010 
folded it but it's not quite long enough
so<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.200> need<00:03:04.740> about<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> 31<00:03:05.820> inch<00:03:06.030> length<00:03:06.780> of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
so you need about a 31 inch length of

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.380 
so you need about a 31 inch length of
paper<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.430> measure<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.790> with<00:03:08.940> Peaks

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
paper I like to measure it with Peaks

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.710 
paper I like to measure it with Peaks
which<00:03:10.140> are<00:03:10.320> these<00:03:10.530> points<00:03:11.190> right<00:03:11.610> here<00:03:11.720> almost

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
which are these points right here almost

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.440 
which are these points right here almost
like<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.440> mountains<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:15.300> in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
like little mountains and then in

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.020 
like little mountains and then in
between<00:03:15.600> are<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.260> valleys<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.550> ones<00:03:17.790> going

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
between are the valleys the ones going

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.290 
between are the valleys the ones going
down<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:19.950> what<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.760> need<00:03:20.940> for<00:03:21.180> this

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
down in here and what you need for this

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.300 
down in here and what you need for this
fan<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:22.430> 20<00:03:23.430> Peaks<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.030> 19<00:03:24.630> valleys<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.130> I've

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
fan is 20 Peaks and 19 valleys so I've

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.910 
fan is 20 Peaks and 19 valleys so I've
counted<00:03:26.670> here<00:03:27.360> my<00:03:28.020> peaks<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.500> valleys<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
counted here my peaks and valleys and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.670 
counted here my peaks and valleys and
I'm<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.430> attach<00:03:29.790> two<00:03:30.240> pieces<00:03:30.440> all<00:03:31.440> I'm

I'm going to attach two pieces all I'm
gonna<00:03:31.830> do<00:03:32.100> with<00:03:32.820> an<00:03:32.940> adhesive<00:03:33.240> roller<00:03:33.660> which

gonna do with an adhesive roller which
are<00:03:34.440> really<00:03:34.770> convenient<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.700> great<00:03:36.090> for

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
are really convenient and great for

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.500 
are really convenient and great for
paper<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.560> you're<00:03:37.680> not<00:03:37.830> using<00:03:38.220> any<00:03:38.700> sort

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
paper so that you're not using any sort

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.420 
paper so that you're not using any sort
of<00:03:39.570> white<00:03:40.410> glue<00:03:40.830> where<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> might<00:03:41.990> bleed<00:03:43.430> under

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
of white glue where it might bleed under

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.090 
of white glue where it might bleed under
and<00:03:44.760> make<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.030> paper<00:03:45.240> moist<00:03:46.020> this<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.770> really

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
and make the paper moist this is really

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.700 
and make the paper moist this is really
dry<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.550> works<00:03:47.970> great<00:03:48.360> for<00:03:48.660> paper<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.440> it's

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
dry and works great for paper and it's

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.190 
dry and works great for paper and it's
permanent<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.820> can<00:03:51.000> see<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.180> put<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> strip

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
permanent so you can see I put a strip

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.560 
permanent so you can see I put a strip
on<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.680> edge<00:03:52.890> here<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.790> strip<00:03:54.090> on<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:54.390> at

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
on one edge here and a strip on one at

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.960 
on one edge here and a strip on one at
edge<00:03:54.810> here<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.530> I'm<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.190> going<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.400> attach

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
edge here and I'm just going to attach

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.090 
edge here and I'm just going to attach
those<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.720> create<00:03:59.480> that<00:04:00.480> last<00:04:00.870> peak<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.650> this

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
those to create that last peak and this

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.180 
those to create that last peak and this
will<00:04:02.280> make<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.580> look<00:04:02.610> seamless<00:04:03.210> as<00:04:03.840> well<00:04:04.290> so

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
will make it look seamless as well so

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.980 
will make it look seamless as well so
you<00:04:05.280> can<00:04:05.370> see<00:04:05.550> now<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.760> have<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.570> long<00:04:06.840> enough

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
you can see now I have a long enough

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.910 
you can see now I have a long enough
strip<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.800> paper<00:04:09.020> so<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.140> next<00:04:10.380> step<00:04:10.590> would<00:04:10.860> be

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
strip of paper so the next step would be

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.790 
strip of paper so the next step would be
painting<00:04:11.790> your<00:04:11.970> tongue<00:04:12.480> depressors<00:04:13.050> I<00:04:13.350> just

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
painting your tongue depressors I just

no easy way to do this and lay it out so
that<00:05:53.960> I'm<00:05:54.960> making<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.650> into<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.460> circle<00:05:57.440> almost

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
that I'm making it into a circle almost

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.899 
that I'm making it into a circle almost
okay<00:05:59.070> and<00:05:59.820> I<00:06:00.479> actually<00:06:00.840> like<00:06:01.169> to<00:06:01.199> squeeze

hole and in that hole we're gonna use

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.339 
hole and in that hole we're gonna use
hot<00:06:11.430> glue<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:13.039> that's<00:06:14.039> gonna<00:06:14.220> secure<00:06:14.849> it

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
hot glue and that's gonna secure it

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.170 
hot glue and that's gonna secure it

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
for that to dry and you just hold it for

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.899 
for that to dry and you just hold it for
maybe<00:06:20.759> you<00:06:21.090> know<00:06:21.210> 30<00:06:21.930> seconds<00:06:22.470> or<00:06:22.770> so<00:06:22.880> wait<00:06:23.880> for

so<00:07:28.330> my<00:07:28.449> fan<00:07:28.690> is<00:07:28.840> almost<00:07:29.199> complete<00:07:29.800> but<00:07:30.039> I'm

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
so my fan is almost complete but I'm

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.399 
so my fan is almost complete but I'm
going<00:07:30.580> to<00:07:30.639> add<00:07:30.789> a<00:07:30.819> little<00:07:31.270> bit<00:07:31.509> of<00:07:31.539> ribbon<00:07:31.990> to

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:48.420 
white to match my popsicle stick and I'm
going<00:07:45.819> to<00:07:45.849> add<00:07:45.969> a<00:07:46.000> little<00:07:46.360> bit<00:07:46.719> of<00:07:47.440> hot<00:07:47.770> glue<00:07:48.009> to

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430 
going to add a little bit of hot glue to

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.719 
going to add a little bit of hot glue to
one<00:07:48.729> end<00:07:49.000> and<00:07:49.330> then<00:07:49.900> attach<00:07:50.289> that<00:07:50.319> to<00:07:51.159> one<00:07:51.370> side

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:51.729 
one end and then attach that to one side

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.110 
one end and then attach that to one side
of<00:07:52.090> my<00:07:52.840> tongue<00:07:53.500> depressor<00:07:54.039> and<00:07:54.279> this<00:07:54.610> is<00:07:54.849> the

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 
of my tongue depressor and this is the

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.760 
of my tongue depressor and this is the
same<00:07:55.360> width<00:07:55.599> of<00:07:55.779> the<00:07:55.900> tongue<00:07:56.080> depressor<00:07:56.529> so

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.770 
same width of the tongue depressor so

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.879 
same width of the tongue depressor so
it'll<00:07:57.159> line<00:07:57.550> up<00:07:57.729> perfectly<00:07:57.940> and<00:07:58.539> this<00:07:59.229> way<00:07:59.440> I

00:07:59.879 --> 00:07:59.889 
it'll line up perfectly and this way I

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:02.339 
it'll line up perfectly and this way I
can<00:08:00.159> hang<00:08:00.699> these<00:08:01.060> because<00:08:02.050> they<00:08:02.139> look<00:08:02.319> so

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:02.349 
can hang these because they look so

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.649 
can hang these because they look so
pretty<00:08:02.860> when<00:08:03.099> they're<00:08:03.250> hanging<00:08:03.520> you<00:08:04.419> want<00:08:04.599> to

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:04.659 
pretty when they're hanging you want to

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:07.740 
pretty when they're hanging you want to
leave<00:08:04.810> maybe<00:08:05.110> about<00:08:05.409> 12<00:08:05.889> inches<00:08:06.190> of<00:08:06.490> ribbon<00:08:07.000> so

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:07.750 
leave maybe about 12 inches of ribbon so

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.629 
leave maybe about 12 inches of ribbon so
make<00:08:07.900> sure<00:08:07.930> you<00:08:08.110> have<00:08:08.229> room<00:08:08.349> to<00:08:08.560> tie<00:08:08.800> it<00:08:08.860> or

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 
make sure you have room to tie it or

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.950 
make sure you have room to tie it or
attach<00:08:10.029> it<00:08:10.270> to<00:08:10.449> wherever<00:08:10.599> you're<00:08:10.779> going<00:08:10.900> to

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 
attach it to wherever you're going to

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.260 
attach it to wherever you're going to
attach<00:08:11.259> it<00:08:11.560> but<00:08:11.919> then<00:08:12.039> it<00:08:12.159> also<00:08:12.340> works<00:08:13.000> if<00:08:13.180> you

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.270 
attach it but then it also works if you

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.189 
attach it but then it also works if you
were<00:08:13.360> to<00:08:13.479> take<00:08:13.659> it<00:08:13.690> off<00:08:13.990> and<00:08:14.520> fan<00:08:15.520> yourself<00:08:16.199> and

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 
were to take it off and fan yourself and

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.800 
were to take it off and fan yourself and
they<00:08:17.319> work<00:08:17.469> really<00:08:17.680> well
