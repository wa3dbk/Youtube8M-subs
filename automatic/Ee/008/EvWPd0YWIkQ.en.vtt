00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
you know anything about it and you don't

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.679 
you know anything about it and you don't
you<00:03:35.769> know<00:03:35.890> wait<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:36.939> period<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.299> time<00:03:37.390> just

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
you know wait that period of time just

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.440 
you know wait that period of time just
to<00:03:37.750> see<00:03:37.900> cuz<00:03:38.730> for<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.790> modbook<00:03:40.120> it's<00:03:40.299> not

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
to see cuz for the modbook it's not

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.509 
to see cuz for the modbook it's not
really<00:03:40.750> huge<00:03:41.170> huge<00:03:41.709> changes<00:03:42.129> but<00:03:42.310> it's<00:03:42.400> pretty

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
really huge huge changes but it's pretty

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.330 
really huge huge changes but it's pretty
it's<00:03:42.819> faster<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.569> has<00:03:44.109> more<00:03:44.290> space<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:45.250> you

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
it's faster and has more space but you

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580 
it's faster and has more space but you
know<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:45.579> not<00:03:45.640> like<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:46.060> whole<00:03:46.840> like<00:03:47.170> design

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
know it's not like a whole like design

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.849 
know it's not like a whole like design
change<00:03:47.859> anything<00:03:48.069> like<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.310> basically<00:03:49.150> a

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
change anything like that basically a

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.229 
change anything like that basically a
they<00:03:50.859> upgrade<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.549> know<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.790> title

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
they upgrade you know the title

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.869 
they upgrade you know the title
technology<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.769> know<00:03:53.889> upgrades<00:03:54.459> along<00:03:54.579> the

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
technology you know upgrades along the

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.629 
technology you know upgrades along the
way<00:03:55.030> they<00:03:55.480> axio<00:03:56.379> try<00:03:56.590> upgrading<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.400> from<00:03:57.579> a

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
way they axio try upgrading it from a

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.690 
way they axio try upgrading it from a
two<00:03:57.819> point<00:03:58.090> one<00:03:58.150> gigahertz<00:03:59.040> to<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.069> 2.4

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
two point one gigahertz to a 2.4

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.330 
two point one gigahertz to a 2.4
gigahertz<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:02.230> know<00:04:02.349> three<00:04:02.560> gigs<00:04:02.859> three

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
gigahertz so you know three gigs three

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.909 
gigahertz so you know three gigs three
gigahertz<00:04:03.639> faster<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.269> what<00:04:04.450> 2.1<00:04:05.019> 2.4<00:04:05.590> kind<00:04:05.859> of

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
gigahertz faster so what 2.1 2.4 kind of

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.369 
gigahertz faster so what 2.1 2.4 kind of
like<00:04:06.099> how<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.400> macbook<00:04:06.879> is<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.269> has<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.139> core

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
like how the macbook is and has the core

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.890 
like how the macbook is and has the core

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.879 
drive so you got more space for you know
your<00:04:16.060> it's<00:04:16.750> built<00:04:16.989> more<00:04:17.109> for<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.349> graphic

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
your it's built more for a graphic

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.670 
your it's built more for a graphic
design<00:04:18.280> like<00:04:18.849> I<00:04:18.940> said<00:04:19.000> it's<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> tablet<00:04:19.630> pc<00:04:19.930> more

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
design like I said it's a tablet pc more

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.800 
design like I said it's a tablet pc more
graphical<00:04:21.310> art<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:21.910> you<00:04:22.210> know<00:04:22.330> if<00:04:22.570> you're<00:04:22.690> on

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
it's your you know the still the base

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.000 
it's your you know the still the base

Tron<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:50.740> partnership<00:04:51.159> with<00:04:51.190> Apple<00:04:51.690> I'm

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
Tron is in partnership with Apple I'm

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.480 
Tron is in partnership with Apple I'm
guessing<00:04:53.470> that<00:04:53.500> they<00:04:53.740> have<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.949> new<00:04:54.099> pen<00:04:54.340> and

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
guessing that they have the new pen and

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.029 
guessing that they have the new pen and
processors<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.240> I'm<00:04:55.389> not<00:04:55.510> sure<00:04:55.539> so<00:04:56.020> but<00:04:56.860> yeah

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
processors and I'm not sure so but yeah

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.529 
processors and I'm not sure so but yeah
so<00:04:57.280> now<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.550> have<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.760> speed<00:04:58.060> boost<00:04:58.270> with<00:04:58.389> that

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
so now you have a speed boost with that

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.420 
so now you have a speed boost with that
so<00:04:58.690> if<00:04:58.750> you're<00:04:58.870> looking<00:04:58.960> into<00:04:59.440> buying<00:04:59.620> a<00:05:00.010> mug

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
so if you're looking into buying a mug

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.740 
so if you're looking into buying a mug
