00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.490
 hello every day 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.650
 today as you will have understood from the title vi 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.380
 I propose simple earrings for 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.199
 New Year therefore also suitable from 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.669
 make beginners come to me 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.960
 this idea because I was looking for a 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.609
 simple jewel I don't feel like 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.279
 put too many trinkets on it 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.960
 I will pass out then to the cold 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.089
 so no necklace, no bracelet 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.310
 nothing in why i'm wrapped up is 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.079
 the only thing left for me to do 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.940
 put are earrings so I have 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.780
 chose to make me some earrings 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.550
 rather showy than he has seen 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.460
 the preview already has an idea of ​​what 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.399
 we are going to do and we need very few 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.219
 materials so I think almost all of them 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.199
 you have at home and will also be 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.140
 very fast earrings 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.129
 first of all we rely on the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.859
 chain 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.640
 I chose this tico linarolo chain 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:07.030
 they are 3 mm circles and if they are 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.220
 will need several inches of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.060
 I can already see these onions 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.979
 are the checks prepared we say vi 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.450
 I will show in the tutorial how to do it anyway 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.060
 the various colors 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.530
 I chose mainly the tones 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.270
 of gray and crystal black in fact 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.860
 stay a while in the glittering theme of 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.310
 new year and also because I see that 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.040
 are the new trends of the moment but 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.299
 We will also need'll show 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.579
 Help 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.520
 a drop in this case always of 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.950
 red faceted glass because you know 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.200
 bring red to new year say 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.159
 lucky doors and us for not knowing either 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.920
 read or write 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.520
 we use it and in the latch read put 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 something obviously intimate then 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.039
 then the classics will be needed 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.049
 feet with a flat head or if 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.570
 you want that ball if you like them if 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.909
 you have those watermarked cups o 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.960
 smooth cups if you like them 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.330
 you decide pliers and nun is one 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.770
 fairly large conjunction linen e 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.500
 this of course for an earring 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.210
 so then we will need two first 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.390
 step 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.130
 we say to do if we want is to 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.590
 create some chain segments 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.520
 I have already prepared as you can 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.510
 see and are quite a few segments 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.000
 long 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.070
 we say that the longer it exceeds 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.680
 then abundantly the four fingers 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:48.220
 they are then about 10 cm to climb about 86 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.990
 43 more or less we say that from dal 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.860
 maximum length you want to get 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.600
 the earring then climb two by two 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.320
 centimeters to make the shorter one 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.380
 until you get five segments done 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.830
 this obviously you have to do them double 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.900
 then two bodies two months long 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.310
 you are lecce in order to do both 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.220
 the earrings always that you don't 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.950
 Please bring a single earring there 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.200
 let's put aside the next step is 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.960
 that of creating the pendants for the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.170
 our earring and so what we do 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.030
 take a nail as I said 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.460
 this very simple tutorial suitable 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.730
 for beginners we insert a cup 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.410
 to slide a spring onion or 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.270
 a pearl however of those if you have 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:42.330
 chosen another cup we push well 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:46.030
 down let's explain our tack 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.540
 we cut with our pliers or the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.600
 wire cutter about one centimeter more or 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.110
 less distance to do the 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.160
 important loop to have a loop 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.530
 nice round use these pliers 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.959
 contesting them 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:09.440
 has a magnitude that is necessary and 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.810
 to create our buttonhole and rotate them in 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.220
 this way we will form a slot 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.810
 completely round we have to do 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.340
 all this procedure for i 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.020
 spring onions and I show you how I am in 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.180
 In this case , I have told you that 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.160
 I had chosen four and I am also of 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.340
 different sizes in my case 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.450
 you can then develop the pendant 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.240
 as you wish 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.570
 let's take our pearl the drop 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.010
 always the same story then nail 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.770
 small cup and then use one of 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.780
 these cone-shaped watermarked cups 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.880
 if you don't have these cups you can do 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.190
 a knot of goldsmithing give a little more 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.240
 nice the tip of the gout I have it 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.210
 blanket awakened pliers for why not 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.610
 I liked the bare room we cut and even 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.610
 here we make our buttonhole 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.070
 if it is a little crooked we say it 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.550
 with pliers and this one is ready too 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.180
 I decided to put lagozza in the 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.210
 then part in the longer chain 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.700
 we are going to take our pieces of 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:29.840
 chain we take our pliers 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.460
 let's open the circle and start 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.200
 insert our pearls at one end 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.240
 and so we hold the first piece 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.760
 obviously this could also be 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.490
 an earring suitable for the new year if 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.669
 we want to finish it so I go on 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.959
 to complete all 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.610
 all the fund the pollution of 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:51.779
 successes sediments the chain and then 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.879
 we assimilate the final part 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.889
 good earring now that I have 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:59.489
 completed as you can see all 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:02.819
 various segments I procure my Nellino 

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:05.759
 joining him in hand with pliers 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.189
 and start enter I enter in order 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.349
 then given large to the smallest since 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.839
 longer another short from the shorter to the 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.719
 longer this then you decide for less 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:19.079
 that you don't want to mix them in order 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:21.749
 they create let's say a little more more 

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:25.319
 visible as they shuffled a bit to 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:26.909
 Bunches know this does to your taste 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.159
 I as I said before used several 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:33.539
 colors if you don't like to put the drop 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:38.189
 red you don't put it otherwise otherwise 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:40.289
 you decide how to do it 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:45.300
 finished putting everyone on ours 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:50.459
 I put my nun and how 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.819
 help of another clamp close close 

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:56.219
 well so that you do not escape anything 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.740
 on thee they were born out of focus but to stay 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:01.829
 with the camera is not simple and the 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.969
 my earring is finished this is here 

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:09.779
 the end result is a beautiful one 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:12.599
 beautiful waterfall of bellini sure if you want 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:15.629
 do something more on the black on the 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.159
 gray so much more matchable you are 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:20.099
 very free to do so I have 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:22.139
 decided to do something very very 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.729
 visible almost a bit tacky but me 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.699
 homes 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.529
 nothing i hope the tutorial is there 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:31.979
 liked this is also the other 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:34.349
 earring and if I manage to make myself one 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:37.769
