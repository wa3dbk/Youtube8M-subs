00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.190
 with a track on the move 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.030
 fast 20 they bend that no 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.160
 comes 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.740
 with the 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.150
 in this case by telling 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.870
 I put it on 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.870
 followed up and then 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.840
 but they can be broken and the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.840
 can forgive 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.990
 with more than 70 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.990
 so that's why 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:15.180
 I like to work 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.180
 because why not 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.690
 the green for me 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.390
 we are going to be placing like this 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.110
 taking the wrong 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.600
 above 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.820
 d 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.360
 because I did it 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.979
 to an exit 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.979
 and not just 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.670
 years allows to work the mind 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.270
 I have no problem 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.270
 let's continue 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.680
 and I can work it 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.680
 dry 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.330
 easy to clean inclusive because 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.040
 finding 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.860
 transparent and what does not figure as a 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:16.860
