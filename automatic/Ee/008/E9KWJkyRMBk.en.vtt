00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.110 
so explain minecraft building a wall
around<00:00:03.899> my<00:00:04.259> stuff<00:00:04.620> don't<00:00:05.370> have<00:00:05.520> much<00:00:05.700> here<00:00:05.730> but

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
around my stuff don't have much here but

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.919 
around my stuff don't have much here but
let's<00:00:07.109> think<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.710> gotta<00:00:08.309> have<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> door<00:00:08.929> it's

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
let's think in I gotta have a door it's

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.600 
let's think in I gotta have a door it's
gonna<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.290> an<00:00:10.349> awesome<00:00:10.440> doors<00:00:10.920> thinking<00:00:11.280> maybe

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
gonna be an awesome doors thinking maybe

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.959 
gonna be an awesome doors thinking maybe
I'll<00:00:11.790> wire<00:00:12.000> up<00:00:12.120> some<00:00:12.150> redstone<00:00:12.799> you<00:00:13.799> know<00:00:13.969> make

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
I'll wire up some redstone you know make

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.730 
I'll wire up some redstone you know make
a<00:00:15.000> double<00:00:15.210> door<00:00:15.450> no<00:00:15.809> double<00:00:16.350> doors<00:00:16.560> not

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a double door no double doors not

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.320 
a double door no double doors not
awesome<00:00:17.220> enough<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.210> better

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
awesome enough it's got to be better

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.800 
awesome enough it's got to be better
than<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:19.580> five<00:00:20.580> doors<00:00:21.060> that's<00:00:22.020> why<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.289> set<00:00:22.470> up

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
than that five doors that's why I set up

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.960 
than that five doors that's why I set up
rig<00:00:24.810> 5<00:00:25.080> doors<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.949> open<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.340> when<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.609> step<00:00:26.820> on

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
rig 5 doors to open up when you step on

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.500 
rig 5 doors to open up when you step on
the<00:00:27.029> pressure<00:00:27.330> plate<00:00:27.949> on<00:00:28.949> either<00:00:29.340> side<00:00:29.699> walk

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the pressure plate on either side walk

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.760 
the pressure plate on either side walk
through<00:00:30.840> automatic<00:00:31.800> reflex<00:00:32.480> damn<00:00:33.480> Pig<00:00:33.770> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
through automatic reflex damn Pig so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.119 
through automatic reflex damn Pig so
when<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> step<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> other<00:00:36.480> ones<00:00:37.129> nothing

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
when you step on the other ones nothing

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.290 
when you step on the other ones nothing
happens<00:00:39.410> step<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> inner<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.000> all<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
happens step on the inner one all the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
happens step on the inner one all the
door<00:00:42.450> open<00:00:43.910> those<00:00:44.910> close<00:00:45.739> those<00:00:46.739> open<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> even

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
door open those close those open so even

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.680 
door open those close those open so even
if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.500> step<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.190> once<00:00:50.370> again

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
if you step on the you know once again

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.510 
if you step on the you know once again
nothing<00:00:51.690> happens<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> step<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
nothing happens you got to step on the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
nothing happens you got to step on the
other<00:00:53.640> wants<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> close<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> door<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
other wants to close the door so if you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.069 
other wants to close the door so if you
see<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.020> this<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.289> five<00:00:58.770> doors<00:00:59.039> closed

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
see in there this all five doors closed

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.810 
see in there this all five doors closed
alright<00:01:02.090> run<00:01:03.090> over<00:01:03.329> them<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:04.100> open<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.159> it's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
alright run over them they open up it's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.230 
alright run over them they open up it's
pretty<00:01:06.060> simple<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> clothes<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
pretty simple and the clothes so all the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.170 
pretty simple and the clothes so all the
wirings<00:01:09.960> hidden<00:01:10.229> under<00:01:10.470> these<00:01:10.850> these<00:01:11.850> slabs

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
wirings hidden under these these slabs

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.719 
wirings hidden under these these slabs
and<00:01:12.600> I'll<00:01:13.170> I'll<00:01:13.799> show<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and I'll I'll show you that in just a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.859 
and I'll I'll show you that in just a
sec<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.950> uncovered<00:01:17.869> actually

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
sec so this is it uncovered actually

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.160 
sec so this is it uncovered actually
before<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.259> covered<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.960 

switching<00:01:25.189> now<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.670> hooked<00:01:26.820> up

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
switching now it's all hooked up

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.880 
switching now it's all hooked up
basically<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:28.310> nor<00:01:29.310> gate<00:01:32.329> some

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
basically to one nor gate some

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.760 
basically to one nor gate some
needlessly<00:01:34.890> complex<00:01:35.430> wiring<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.590> combine<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
needlessly complex wiring to combine the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.940 
needlessly complex wiring to combine the
signals<00:01:38.130> from<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> two<00:01:38.820> different<00:01:39.060> sides

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
signals from the two different sides

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
signals from the two different sides
this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:41.400> set<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.470> switch

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this is what I got set up here to switch

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.789 
this is what I got set up here to switch
the<00:01:43.680> doors<00:01:44.119> it's<00:01:45.119> kind<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.810> hard<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.259> order<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the doors it's kind of hard in order to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.480 
the doors it's kind of hard in order to
get<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> signal<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> relay<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.909> top<00:01:49.490> when

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
get the signal to relay out top when

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
get the signal to relay out top when
they're<00:01:50.610> side<00:01:50.790> by<00:01:50.820> side<00:01:51.350> over<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.130> other

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
they're side by side over here the other

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.649 
they're side by side over here the other
side<00:01:54.890> using<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> fuse<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
side using the fuse to have the the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.100 
side using the fuse to have the the
wires<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.799> by<00:01:58.829> side<00:01:59.189> without<00:02:00.110> that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
wires go side by side without that

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.760 
wires go side by side without that
interfering<00:02:02.930> sends<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> signal<00:02:04.350> back<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
interfering sends the signal back to the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.889 
interfering sends the signal back to the
outside<00:02:05.100> where<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.520> combined<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.780> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
outside where it's combined for going to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.639 
outside where it's combined for going to
the<00:02:06.990> gate<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:09.179> pretty<00:02:09.390> simple<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.989> lot<00:02:10.619> of

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the gate so it's pretty simple a lot of

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.680 
the gate so it's pretty simple a lot of
redstone<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.430> lot<00:02:11.580> more<00:02:11.730> than<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.970> expected<00:02:12.060> I'll

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
redstone a lot more than I expected I'll

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.140 
redstone a lot more than I expected I'll
same<00:02:12.959> set<00:02:13.170> up<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.500> side

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
same set up on this side

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.520 
same set up on this side
so<00:02:18.470> on<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.620> side<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.860> had<00:02:20.280> an<00:02:20.400> issue<00:02:20.550> where<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
so on this side I had an issue where the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.170 
so on this side I had an issue where the
doors<00:02:22.830> would<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.720> delay<00:02:25.050> caused<00:02:25.500> problems

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
doors would the delay caused problems

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.809 
doors would the delay caused problems
show<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.239> my<00:02:28.020> run<00:02:28.230> backwards<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.340> doesn't

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
show you my run backwards and doesn't

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.370 
show you my run backwards and doesn't
happen<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.150> done<00:02:31.190> I'll<00:02:32.190> run<00:02:32.400> backwards<00:02:33.380> see

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
happen this done I'll run backwards see

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.410 
happen this done I'll run backwards see
that's<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:35.190> optimal<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.760> put<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that's not optimal so I put in the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.590 
that's not optimal so I put in the
switch<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.010> delay<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:39.239> then<00:02:39.390> no

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
switch just up the delay and then no

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.600 
switch just up the delay and then no
longer<00:02:39.930> happen<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.860> needlessly

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
longer happen so it's a needlessly

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.959 
longer happen so it's a needlessly
complex<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.950> cool<00:02:47.569> five<00:02:48.569> doors
