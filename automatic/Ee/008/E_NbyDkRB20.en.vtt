inside the vehicle actually you left

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.399 
inside the vehicle actually you left

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
outside so replace it with one that you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
outside so replace it with one that you
don't<00:02:04.649> usually<00:02:04.829> use<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.520> dress<00:02:05.729> replace<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
don't usually use I dress replace it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.490 
don't usually use I dress replace it
with<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> Biff<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.869> or<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> rabble

with the Biff there or the rabble

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
with the Biff there or the rabble
basically<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.310> replace<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.060> duplicated

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
basically just replace it the duplicated

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.600 
basically just replace it the duplicated
car<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.110> you're<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> card

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
car that you're going to get with a card

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.410 
car that you're going to get with a card
that<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.760> don't<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.180> use<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.020> then

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
that you don't really use and then

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.850 
that you don't really use and then
that's<00:02:13.540> basically<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.200> duplication<00:02:14.830> glitch

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
that's basically the duplication glitch

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.770 
that's basically the duplication glitch
don't<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.400> now<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.760> duplicated<00:02:16.450> version

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
don't you now have a duplicated version

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.510 
don't you now have a duplicated version
and<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.349> should<00:02:17.500> also<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.130> original

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and you should also have the original

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.729 
and you should also have the original
version<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.390> need<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.620> I

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
version all you need to do it's like I

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.140 
version all you need to do it's like I
said<00:02:21.010> replace<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.459> with<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> vehicle<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.030> you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
said replace it with a vehicle that you

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.699 
said replace it with a vehicle that you
don't<00:02:22.390> use<00:02:22.569> for<00:02:22.780> me<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.170> biffed<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
don't use for me it's the biffed it and

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.199 
don't use for me it's the biffed it and
you<00:02:23.770> will<00:02:23.830> actually<00:02:23.980> see<00:02:24.190> when<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.580> choose<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
you will actually see when I choose to

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.520 
you will actually see when I choose to
replace<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.599> with<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.750> better<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.319> see

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.380 
replace it with the better you can see
it<00:02:26.650> actually<00:02:26.890> change<00:02:27.640> at<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> top<00:02:27.910> left<00:02:28.300> hand

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
it actually change at the top left hand

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.240 
it actually change at the top left hand
corner<00:02:28.569> if<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.290> then<00:02:29.440> walk<00:02:29.650> outside<00:02:30.040> your

waiting there and that's basically the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.610 
waiting there and that's basically the
duplication<00:02:34.810> glitch<00:02:34.840> done<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.440> now<00:02:35.560> take

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
duplication glitch done you can now take

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.500 
duplication glitch done you can now take
