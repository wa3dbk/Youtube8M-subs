00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.330
 man beekeeping 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.060
 The first thing that contributes is student worth 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.350
 Health &amp; Wellness 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.800
 teaches you to respect the environment that you 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.360
 surrounds is to say that if you give to the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.570
 Nature's nature is going to give you 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.760
 to you if you take away too much 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.600
 nature will answer you for the same 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.320
 way is to say that we have a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.350
 a balance between the human and the bee 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.969
 what is important to maintain so that all 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.969
 life follow 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.230
 good leave it for the field is life 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.510
 same without the time that the field like that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.980
 she lacks a link to a chain she 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.130
 little motor that moves all the rest 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.040
 things without pollination of the bee 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.160
 enjoy neither flowers nor grass nor angels 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.570
 even from the ground fixed to the ground if 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.010
 there is no grass simpler than us 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.360
 trample them we call them weeds and the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.390
 we burn with liter and liter of glyphosate 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.590
 you are fulfilling its function that is 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.540
 sustain the fertile layers of that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.050
 soil so that without bee and without that 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.210
 grass 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.210
 we begin by eroding the time each 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.820
 more time to be desert without bees 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.250
 there is fruit without bees there are no flowers what 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.310
 what happens that the group of people who 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.920
 great majority considers it to be an insect 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.890
 until harmful and from the latest movies 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.020
 of killer bees and things potency in 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.369
 that animosity of the people but after 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.259
 one when the world of this one is entering 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.720
 is made of each hive and sees that they are not 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.430
 as bad as they are painted there goes 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.430
 discovering the true potential 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.229
 for me what in my experience 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.150
 of what most die is what what 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.720
 we use to fertilize the field 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.850
 to cure a disease of a tree 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.960
 to control pests we believe that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.100
 we found the pests not the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.990
 we control 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.130
 we do the opposite we increase the 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.990
 we enrich because they get stronger 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.740
 and the bee does not know it to such an animal 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.730
 weak that when 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.800
 any kind of chemical falls 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.260
 the hive arrives is lost or dies in 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:33.400
 the field and the truth is that they get lost 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.930
 many hives for that reason if the time that 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.790
 unfortunately it is threatened as 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 we are threatened ourselves 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.210
 bee today is the canary of the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.560
 miner remember when fear 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.930
 The mine came down with a canary 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.610
 well the canary was dying of you know 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.080
 being the miner up that here the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.060
 air is bad good bees is 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.100
 dying is not saying care that the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.860
 world is bad you have to listen to it there 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.480
 to listen to him because if we do not give him 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.170
 attention that message we are going to have 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.170
 very difficult times 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.770
 we
