the top it's real easy once you get the
hang<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.430> I'm<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> simply<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
hang of it and I'm going to simply just

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.280 
hang of it and I'm going to simply just
loosen<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:27.439> like<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:29.750> it's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.900> little<00:01:31.170> bit

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
loosen this like that it's a little bit

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
loosen this like that it's a little bit
tight<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.610> supposed<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> be

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
tight but that's how it's supposed to be

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.740 
tight but that's how it's supposed to be
because<00:01:33.689> without<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.799> tight<00:01:35.070> headset<00:01:35.750> you're

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
nut right here and I'm going to Ajay
going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> tighten<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.649> little<00:01:49.680> bit<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.399> what

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
going to tighten a little bit and what

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.569 
going to tighten a little bit and what
that<00:01:50.880> will<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:51.899> compress<00:01:52.579> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that will do is that will compress the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.690 
that will do is that will compress the
ball<00:01:54.060> bearings<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:54.750> down<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
ball bearings that are down here and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.270 
ball bearings that are down here and
here<00:01:56.930> closer<00:01:57.930> together<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.009> there<00:01:59.159> won't

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
here closer together and so there won't

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480 
here closer together and so there won't
be<00:01:59.399> any<00:01:59.490> movement<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.409> now<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.189> headset

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
be any movement so now that the headset

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.139 
be any movement so now that the headset
is<00:02:02.820> loose<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.780> ahead<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.170> adjust<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
is loose I can go ahead and adjust that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.410 
is loose I can go ahead and adjust that
just<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.600> gently<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:08.030> just<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.119> tiny

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
just really gently like that just a tiny

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.870 
just really gently like that just a tiny
bit<00:02:09.780> tiny<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> hair

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
bit tiny bit of a hair

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.250 
bit tiny bit of a hair
and<00:02:12.830> then<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:13.980> I'm<00:02:14.070> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:15.260> you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and then what I'm going to do is you

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.540 
and then what I'm going to do is you
can't<00:02:16.500> simply<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:17.100> tighten<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.490> down

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
can't simply just tighten it down

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.370 
can't simply just tighten it down
because<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> would<00:02:18.360> mash<00:02:18.600> all<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.170> ball

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
because that would mash all the ball

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.890 
because that would mash all the ball
bearings<00:02:19.830> together<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.820> need<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.540> use<00:02:21.720> this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
bearings together so I need to use this

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.710 
bearings together so I need to use this
bottom<00:02:22.350> wrench<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.000> hold<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.570> in

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
bottom wrench and just hold that in

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.340 
bottom wrench and just hold that in
place

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
place

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.050 
place
and<00:02:25.440> then<00:02:26.160> I'm<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.460> tighten<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> top

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and then I'm going to tighten the top

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.270 
and then I'm going to tighten the top
wrench<00:02:27.360> against<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.290> bottom<00:02:28.500> wrench<00:02:28.830> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
wrench against the bottom wrench and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
wrench against the bottom wrench and
what<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.000> will<00:02:30.120> do<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:31.050> will<00:02:31.170> tighten

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
what that will do is that will tighten

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.380 
what that will do is that will tighten
them<00:02:31.620> together<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.970> headset<00:02:33.330> will

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
them together and then the headset will

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.990 
them together and then the headset will
be<00:02:33.540> tight<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:35.000> then<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.270> go<00:02:36.390> riding<00:02:38.000> so

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
be tight and then we can go riding so

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.030 
be tight and then we can go riding so
it's<00:02:39.810> really<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.290> simple<00:02:42.500> operation<00:02:43.640> there<00:02:46.040> so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
it's really a simple operation there so

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's really a simple operation there so
now<00:02:47.160> those<00:02:47.340> two<00:02:47.760> are<00:02:47.790> tightened<00:02:48.300> against<00:02:48.960> each

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
now those two are tightened against each

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.940 
now those two are tightened against each
other<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:51.480> next<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.470> can

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
other and what I can do next is I can

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.690 
other and what I can do next is I can
test<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.580> see<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:55.170> headset<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.740> tight<00:02:56.070> as<00:02:56.280> I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
test to see if the headset is tight as I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.430 
test to see if the headset is tight as I
want<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.240> by<00:02:57.450> simply<00:02:57.840> putting<00:02:58.020> my<00:02:58.200> hands

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
want it to be by simply putting my hands

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.710 
want it to be by simply putting my hands
back<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> brakes<00:02:59.600> squeezing<00:03:00.600> them

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
back on the brakes squeezing them

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.810 
back on the brakes squeezing them
together<00:03:01.070> trying<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> move<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> bike<00:03:02.580> back

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
together trying to move the bike back

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.200 
together trying to move the bike back
and<00:03:03.030> forth<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.570> no<00:03:04.530> movement<00:03:05.100> mount<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:05.850> this

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
and forth a no movement mount now this

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.090 
and forth a no movement mount now this
is<00:03:06.360> what<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.630> like<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:09.290> that's<00:03:10.290> how<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.650> go
