you<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.820> wouldn't<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.750> split

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you know I wouldn't know if it's split

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.119 
you know I wouldn't know if it's split
down<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> middle<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> fans<00:02:07.979> are

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
down the middle I think the fans are

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:08.930 
down the middle I think the fans are
cheering<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.369> little<00:02:08.520> bit<00:02:08.610> more<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
cheering a little bit more for the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940 
cheering a little bit more for the
shield<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> fans<00:02:10.110> certainly

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
shield but I think the fans certainly
respect<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.819> wire<00:02:12.120> sent<00:02:12.480> are<00:02:12.720> not
