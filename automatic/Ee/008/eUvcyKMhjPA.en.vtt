your street is likely to have and there

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.220 
your street is likely to have and there
are<00:00:14.519> several<00:00:14.730> really<00:00:15.269> really<00:00:15.839> important

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
are several really really important

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.970 
are several really really important
reasons<00:00:16.529> for<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
reasons for that

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.300 
reasons for that
first<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.940> all<00:00:18.029> you've<00:00:18.600> got<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.900> big

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
first of all you've got this big

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.980 
first of all you've got this big
capacity<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.150> 14<00:00:21.600> inches<00:00:21.930> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
capacity here so this is 14 inches in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.320 
capacity here so this is 14 inches in
diameter<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.160> you've<00:00:23.279> got<00:00:23.400> big<00:00:23.699> amounts<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
diameter so you've got big amounts of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.460 
diameter so you've got big amounts of
root<00:00:24.720> run<00:00:25.080> here

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
root run here

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.189 
root run here
you'll<00:00:26.010> also<00:00:26.160> notice<00:00:26.550> these<00:00:26.910> little<00:00:27.180> gates<00:00:27.990> as

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
you'll also notice these little gates as

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
you'll also notice these little gates as
we<00:00:28.320> describe<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.670> holes<00:00:30.539> here

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
we describe them with these holes here

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.139 
we describe them with these holes here
now<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.340> really<00:00:32.880> clever

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
now this is the really really clever

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
now this is the really really clever
part<00:00:33.420> about<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> EZ<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.290> hanging<00:00:34.530> baskets

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
part about the EZ for hanging baskets

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.260 
part about the EZ for hanging baskets
and<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> show<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.460> how<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> plant

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and I'm going to show you how to plant

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.680 
and I'm going to show you how to plant
these<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:37.129> pop<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.300> gates

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
these up now pop out the little gates

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
these up now pop out the little gates
and<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.050> set<00:00:40.200> those<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.520> side<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and just set those to one side and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
and just set those to one side and
you'll<00:00:42.000> notice<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.600> literally<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.680> pop

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you'll notice they literally just pop

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350 
you'll notice they literally just pop
out<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.700> apply<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.149> bit<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
out so you just apply a little bit of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.930 
out so you just apply a little bit of
force<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> top<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.309> lug

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
force at the top and the little lug

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.690 
force at the top and the little lug
there<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.539> pops<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:50.520> take

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
there just pops out so you can then take

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.569 
there just pops out so you can then take
out<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> gates<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.739> start<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.280> all

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
just budge the basket to the front

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.960 
just budge the basket to the front
you've<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.479> large<00:01:52.050> aperture<00:01:52.800> here<00:01:53.040> with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you've got this large aperture here with

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.359 
you've got this large aperture here with
this<00:01:54.420> lovely<00:01:55.409> neck<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.190> going<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this lovely neck and what I'm going to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.180 
this lovely neck and what I'm going to
do<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.210> bottom<00:01:57.540> four<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.009> put

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
do in the bottom four I'm going to put

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.090 
do in the bottom four I'm going to put
some<00:01:59.400> bacopa<00:01:59.909> clamps<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.800> what<00:02:01.979> you'll

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
some bacopa clamps in now what you'll

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.210 
some bacopa clamps in now what you'll
notice<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.090> plant<00:02:03.330> goes<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:04.130> from<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
notice is the plant goes in from the

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.540 
notice is the plant goes in from the
outside<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.140> absolutely<00:02:07.550> no

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
outside in and there is absolutely no

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.930 
outside in and there is absolutely no
root<00:02:08.789> disturbance<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.630> then<00:02:10.380> all<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.940> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
root disturbance and then all I do is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.910 
root disturbance and then all I do is
literally<00:02:12.530> slide<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.680> basket<00:02:14.069> down<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.800> then

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
literally slide the basket down and then

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.699 
literally slide the basket down and then
click<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.340> position<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:18.330> bacopa<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:19.440> then

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
click it in position that bacopa is then

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.940 
click it in position that bacopa is then
perfectly<00:02:20.190> planted<00:02:20.430> now<00:02:21.470> let's<00:02:22.470> pop<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.800> next

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
perfectly planted now let's pop the next

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.830 
perfectly planted now let's pop the next
one<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.690> again

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840

the hole of the root ball goes through

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.240 
the hole of the root ball goes through
just<00:02:28.280> position<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> plant<00:02:29.610> there<00:02:29.820> nicely

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
just position the plant there nicely

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.180 
just position the plant there nicely

tray all of the roots remain intact and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.630 
tray all of the roots remain intact and
you<00:03:04.010> end<00:03:04.190> up<00:03:04.360> with<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:05.510> perfect<00:03:06.350> placement

more<00:03:15.470> compost<00:03:15.860> on<00:03:16.040> now<00:03:16.940> if<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.090> wanted<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.450> of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
more compost on now if you wanted to of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.710 
more compost on now if you wanted to of
course<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.470> could<00:03:18.650> put<00:03:18.830> some<00:03:19.010> additional<00:03:19.880> gel

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
course you could put some additional gel

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.350 
course you could put some additional gel
and<00:03:20.840> feed<00:03:20.990> in<00:03:21.140> here<00:03:21.640> one<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.790> questions<00:03:23.210> we

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
and feed in here one of the questions we

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.780 
and feed in here one of the questions we
often<00:03:23.480> get<00:03:23.690> asked<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.610> doesn't<00:03:25.610> all<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
often get asked is doesn't all the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.790 
often get asked is doesn't all the
compost<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.270> fall<00:03:26.600> through<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:27.560> gates

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
compost just fall through the gates

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.620 
compost just fall through the gates
because<00:03:28.160> of<00:03:28.280> course<00:03:28.490> what<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.270> notice<00:03:29.420> about

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
because of course what you notice about

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.560 
because of course what you notice about
the<00:03:29.900> gates<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.800> it's<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.490> latticework<00:03:31.880> rather

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
the gates is it's a latticework rather

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.020 
the gates is it's a latticework rather
than<00:03:32.840> solid<00:03:33.170> now<00:03:33.410> what<00:03:34.280> you'll<00:03:34.400> notice<00:03:34.700> once<00:03:34.910> a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
than solid now what you'll notice once a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.910 
than solid now what you'll notice once a
compost<00:03:35.420> is<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.870> does<00:03:36.230> not<00:03:36.500> fall<00:03:36.890> through

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
compost is in it does not fall through

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.670 
compost is in it does not fall through
there<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.970> what<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.240> does<00:03:38.420> allow<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.960> plenty

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
there but what it does allow is plenty

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.920 
there but what it does allow is plenty
of<00:03:39.830> air<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.700> actually<00:03:41.030> get<00:03:41.240> access<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
of air to actually get access to the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.050 
of air to actually get access to the
basket<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.800> that's<00:03:43.040> what<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.400> roots<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:43.970> your

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
basket and that's what the roots of your

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.150 
basket and that's what the roots of your
plants<00:03:44.540> actually<00:03:44.720> need<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.320> really<00:03:45.620> thrive<00:03:45.830> so

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
plants actually need to really thrive so

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.610 
plants actually need to really thrive so
the<00:03:46.790> lattice<00:03:47.150> gates<00:03:47.390> rather<00:03:48.170> than<00:03:48.380> caused<00:03:48.590> a

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
the lattice gates rather than caused a

the lattice gates rather than caused a
problem<00:03:48.890> actually<00:03:49.610> give<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.450> plant<00:03:50.690> exactly

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.210 
the tray and the really good thing about
this<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.670> that<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.830> question<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:24.950> I'm<00:04:25.040> often

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
this is that a question that I'm often

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
asked is how many plants do I need to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.840 
asked is how many plants do I need to
actually<00:04:27.440> put<00:04:27.650> into<00:04:28.040> my<00:04:28.160> hanging<00:04:28.340> baskets

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
actually put into my hanging baskets

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.320 
actually put into my hanging baskets
well<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.990> course<00:04:30.340> with<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.460> easy<00:04:31.580> fill<00:04:31.880> system

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330

there's no questions you just put one

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.390 
there's no questions you just put one
plant<00:04:35.330> per<00:04:35.570> planting<00:04:36.410> hole<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.860> really<00:04:37.220> is

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
and the gates just slide down into

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.840 
and the gates just slide down into
position<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:52.040> then<00:04:52.310> once<00:04:52.520> you've<00:04:52.640> got<00:04:52.760> them

additional<00:05:57.860> volume<00:05:58.190> of<00:05:58.279> compost<00:05:59.229> into<00:06:00.229> the

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
additional volume of compost into the

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.559 
additional volume of compost into the
planting<00:06:01.069> area<00:06:01.219> and<00:06:01.940> what<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:02.360> rate

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
planting area and what that rate

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.290 
planting area and what that rate
basically<00:06:03.110> means<00:06:03.319> is<00:06:03.500> as<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.949> plants<00:06:04.460> are

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
basically means is as the plants are

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.149 
basically means is as the plants are
developing<00:06:05.779> they've<00:06:05.930> got<00:06:06.080> a<00:06:06.139> greater<00:06:06.500> volume

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
developing they've got a greater volume

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.089 
developing they've got a greater volume
to<00:06:07.819> grow<00:06:08.000> in<00:06:08.150> now<00:06:08.629> you've<00:06:08.779> got<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.110> whole<00:06:09.830> sort

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
to grow in now you've got the whole sort

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.279 
to grow in now you've got the whole sort
of<00:06:10.159> hanging<00:06:10.310> basket<00:06:10.759> chains<00:06:11.029> here<00:06:11.330> what<00:06:12.169> I'm

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
of hanging basket chains here what I'm

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.320 
of hanging basket chains here what I'm
going<00:06:12.500> to<00:06:12.589> do<00:06:12.770> is<00:06:13.159> I'm<00:06:13.339> going<00:06:13.460> to<00:06:13.550> position

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
going to do is I'm going to position

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.040 
going to do is I'm going to position
these<00:06:15.139> petunias<00:06:15.849> such<00:06:16.849> that<00:06:17.120> they're<00:06:17.360> in

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
these petunias such that they're in

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.600 
these petunias such that they're in
between<00:06:19.539> those<00:06:20.620> chains<00:06:21.620> so<00:06:22.039> the<00:06:22.190> chains<00:06:22.490> come

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
between those chains so the chains come

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.969 
between those chains so the chains come
up<00:06:22.849> they<00:06:22.969> don't<00:06:23.180> actually<00:06:23.449> do<00:06:24.440> any<00:06:24.589> damage<00:06:24.830> to

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
up they don't actually do any damage to

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.089 
up they don't actually do any damage to
my<00:06:25.330> petunias<00:06:26.349> okay<00:06:27.349> so<00:06:27.409> I'm<00:06:27.740> just<00:06:27.770> going<00:06:28.069> to

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
my petunias okay so I'm just going to

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.570 
my petunias okay so I'm just going to
pop<00:06:28.279> that<00:06:28.629> one<00:06:29.629> in<00:06:29.750> there<00:06:30.190> I'm<00:06:31.190> going<00:06:31.339> to<00:06:31.400> pop

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
pop that one in there I'm going to pop

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.450 
pop that one in there I'm going to pop
one<00:06:31.789> more<00:06:31.819> in<00:06:32.449> here

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
one more in here

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.290 
one more in here
and<00:06:35.460> then<00:06:35.610> I'm<00:06:35.700> going<00:06:35.790> to<00:06:35.850> put<00:06:36.000> the<00:06:36.090> final

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
and then I'm going to put the final

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.020 
and then I'm going to put the final
plant<00:06:37.130> right<00:06:38.130> in<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.370> center<00:06:38.700> at<00:06:38.790> the<00:06:38.850> top

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
plant right in the center at the top

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.950 
plant right in the center at the top
there<00:06:39.560> and<00:06:40.560> that<00:06:40.710> really<00:06:40.980> is<00:06:41.510> my<00:06:42.510> easy<00:06:42.720> fill

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
there and that really is my easy fill

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.740 
there and that really is my easy fill
basket<00:06:43.470> plant<00:06:44.370> it<00:06:44.580> so<00:06:45.240> what<00:06:45.360> I'm<00:06:45.450> going<00:06:45.540> to<00:06:45.600> do

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
basket plant it so what I'm going to do

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.260 
basket plant it so what I'm going to do
now<00:06:46.070> is<00:06:47.070> to<00:06:47.310> apply<00:06:47.340> the<00:06:47.580> chain<00:06:47.910> now<00:06:48.030> there<00:06:48.180> are

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
now is to apply the chain now there are

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.110 
now is to apply the chain now there are
four<00:06:48.920> chain<00:06:49.920> positions<00:06:50.400> and<00:06:50.610> these<00:06:50.820> have<00:06:51.000> got

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
four chain positions and these have got

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.830 
four chain positions and these have got
a<00:06:51.150> t-bar<00:06:51.690> design<00:06:52.190> to<00:06:53.190> the<00:06:53.310> chain<00:06:53.550> and<00:06:53.840> these

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
a t-bar design to the chain and these

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.960 
a t-bar design to the chain and these
are<00:06:55.020> so<00:06:55.200> so<00:06:55.440> effective<00:06:55.920> so<00:06:56.070> all<00:06:56.250> we<00:06:56.370> do<00:06:56.520> when<00:06:56.880> we

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
are so so effective so all we do when we

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.460 
are so so effective so all we do when we
actually<00:06:57.090> come<00:06:57.390> to<00:06:57.510> put<00:06:57.660> these<00:06:57.780> out<00:06:57.990> down<00:06:58.260> into

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
actually come to put these out down into

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.520 
actually come to put these out down into
the<00:06:59.030> planting<00:07:00.030> hole<00:07:00.150> is<00:07:00.300> you<00:07:00.480> just<00:07:00.990> pop<00:07:01.350> them

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
the planting hole is you just pop them

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.590 
the planting hole is you just pop them
like<00:07:01.560> that<00:07:01.830> and<00:07:02.760> then<00:07:02.940> you<00:07:03.030> feed<00:07:03.240> them<00:07:03.390> down

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
like that and then you feed them down

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.360 
like that and then you feed them down
into<00:07:03.810> the<00:07:03.930> hole<00:07:04.110> and<00:07:04.290> as<00:07:04.440> they<00:07:04.680> drop<00:07:05.160> down

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
into the hole and as they drop down

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.790 
into the hole and as they drop down
you'll<00:07:05.550> notice<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:06.300> t-bar<00:07:06.750> force<00:07:07.560> to<00:07:07.710> the

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
you'll notice the t-bar force to the

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.140 
you'll notice the t-bar force to the
right<00:07:07.920> position<00:07:08.310> and<00:07:08.460> then<00:07:08.610> as<00:07:08.700> we<00:07:08.850> pull<00:07:09.060> it

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
right position and then as we pull it

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.890 
right position and then as we pull it
back<00:07:09.270> up<00:07:09.480> it<00:07:10.290> anchors<00:07:10.740> there<00:07:10.950> perfectly<00:07:11.900> and

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
back up it anchors there perfectly and

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.330 
back up it anchors there perfectly and
you<00:07:12.990> literally<00:07:13.290> repeat<00:07:13.680> that<00:07:13.830> for<00:07:14.190> all<00:07:14.220> four

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
you literally repeat that for all four

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.140 
you literally repeat that for all four
chains<00:07:16.250> I'll<00:07:17.250> share<00:07:17.550> this<00:07:17.670> one<00:07:17.850> around<00:07:18.030> the

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
chains I'll share this one around the

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.490 
chains I'll share this one around the
front<00:07:18.650> so<00:07:19.650> again<00:07:19.920> two<00:07:20.220> bars<00:07:20.490> in<00:07:20.760> its<00:07:21.500> normal

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
front so again two bars in its normal

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.800 
front so again two bars in its normal
position<00:07:22.620> I'm<00:07:23.040> just<00:07:23.280> turning<00:07:23.670> it<00:07:23.940> 90<00:07:24.120> degrees

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
position I'm just turning it 90 degrees

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.500 
position I'm just turning it 90 degrees
dropping<00:07:25.590> it<00:07:25.680> down<00:07:25.710> there<00:07:26.160> and<00:07:27.060> as<00:07:27.150> I<00:07:27.240> pull<00:07:27.420> it

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
dropping it down there and as I pull it

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.640 
dropping it down there and as I pull it
up<00:07:27.600> it's<00:07:27.720> like<00:07:27.870> a<00:07:27.900> ship's<00:07:28.200> anchor<00:07:28.350> it's

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
up it's like a ship's anchor it's

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.130 
up it's like a ship's anchor it's
hooking<00:07:29.130> beautifully<00:07:29.940> on<00:07:30.450> the<00:07:30.780> plastic

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.140 
hooking beautifully on the plastic

moulding<00:07:31.470> and<00:07:32.010> the<00:07:32.610> fourth<00:07:32.910> and<00:07:33.150> final<00:07:33.420> one

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
moulding and the fourth and final one

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.280 
moulding and the fourth and final one
goes<00:07:33.930> in

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290 
goes in

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.290 
goes in
