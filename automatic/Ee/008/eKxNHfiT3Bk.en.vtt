00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:00.050
 another's right is peace that phrase 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.320
 very famous very illustrious the one used for 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.320

 ok not about your hairstyle some that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.500
 consider the precursor of the look 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.630
 what do you think about it but if we have 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.200
 we have or we see well I know we have to 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.000
 be what we have to be 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.980

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.660
 zone jez and the three that I just finished the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.979
 interview but not all is not part of the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.120
 drama suited me tell what it 's like 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.120
 leave on the tickets 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.670
 in the 20 pesos bills you expected a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.160
 highest value or a higher ticket 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.310
 denomination the truth seems to me 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.070
 appropriate since I consider myself a person 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.550
 simple besides that it is something very well 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.920
 well my facial gestures as well as my 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.880
 trapezoids and shoulders which makes me see 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.880
 very manly I do not know what you think of 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.780
 that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.590
 What do you think about Ciudad Juarez being the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.900
 most violent of the country makes me sad 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.030
 because there they do not respect the rights of others 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:37.620
 that's why there is no deep peace and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.560
 the and the characters and the three that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.349
 now yes we are done no no not yet 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.650
