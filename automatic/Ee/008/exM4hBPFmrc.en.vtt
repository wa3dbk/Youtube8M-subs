00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 it's like we would like 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.460
 reloading 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.429
 We discuss every day we have 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.460
 would also have the possibility 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:14.219
 to refill but of course find it already 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.139
 said yes makes no money on one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.970
 side and the same 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.520
 sum up again and would have too 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 if our players keep but still 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 very economical usually still two million 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.260
 is spent and also after the money 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.750
 However, the vote in favor of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 reality yes, we still have one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 positive balance we already have 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.380
 So far, eight million have been spent 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 is not quite so far but we are us 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 We are aware of it 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.600
 both alex and i shed that 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.550
 what to do 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.559
 but of course only in the area of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.800
 quality not in the area of ​​quantity 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.079
 and we will not be there if necessary 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.640
 before we just do any 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.039
 to put signs 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 but it is still a week to surprise 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.010
 it is so that we of course a united 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.379
 are a very healthy club though 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.879
 Of course, neither a club of one 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.240
 patron is still supported 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.240
 factory club and of course we already and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.850
 transfer politics have to do that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.330
 we train players to pick up though 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.920
 always generate money with you as well 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.509
 we are ready too in this risk too 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 then you can see in the case that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.590
 we decided with martin 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.390
 Harnik and all of them like two players 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.979
 not to let go though offers there 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.909
 although they were next free transfer 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 could go 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.560
 but we have to mean you somewhere, too 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.570
 generate revenue at the position 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.340
 from antonio we have with timo 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.630
 baumgarten a plant that we 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.460
 meanwhile be too far that into the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.049
 can press footsteps and that's why 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.610
 we used the chance right here 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.590
 funds to the new tracks and now was 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 The question can be there as the front 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.630
 walk or walk a rüdiger and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.549
 Rhineland tailors go as well 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 Workshops from what for offers there 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.049
 Of course Toni was not fit 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.369
 with his knee op and then you 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.969
 Easy choices have us 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.189
 decided 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.930
 we take the risk that we daniel 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.509
 keep the next free transfer 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.969
 can go and sell antonio radic 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.950
 to a clear agreement both at the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.259
 since we as well as martin harnik 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.920
 and we will take until the end of september 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.330
 we will get a definite information 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.400
 the player needs because we just 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.300
 want to plan long term if you 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.860
 has long-term plans 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.470
 Can not you do a potential 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.790
 new entry in october say now wants 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.510
 I'm in April to anyone 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.310
 decides 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.800
 that's why they 're both going to play 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.800
 in the middle of september
