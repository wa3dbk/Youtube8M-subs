00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.190
 when the resident evil inventor shinji 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.719
 mikami makes a new horror game then 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.400
 I look very carefully because that must 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 be exciting and you wolfgang it was in 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.720
 frankfurt and could the evil beginning 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.609
 to play yes we have two chapters 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.920
 84 chapters are played 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.039
 Here we see the fourth chapter where you 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.359
 a village has to explore and there 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.120
 a weird way it hits 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.829
 not at patients around vorwerk 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.480
 appetizing and immediately 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.520
 the scenes are from the pc version you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 have played pc well the thing 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.559
 also comes for actually all common 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.149
 consoles xbox out of ps4 xbox 360 and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.079
 ps3 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.360
 and it's technically whole 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.860
 mannerly good the black bars that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.449
 of course, the ultimate widescreen format 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.170
 and that saves you, of course 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.000
 resolution 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.399
 I have it just section 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.989
 calculator is so 19 20 times 27 is it then 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.250
 So full hd mixed with normal hd there 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 then you have not calculated a lot 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.040
 But it will be back to the game 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.790
 more survival or is it more people 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.640
 operate 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.950
 yes the riddles are a bit disgusting in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.950
 play there comes later completely different 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 things where you get stuck in brains 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 must then respond to it or else 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.110
 Not 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 all administrators I would already be there 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.330
 fallen off the chair 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.100
 So I'm pretty much on the outside 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.780
 it is easy to live alive splatter 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.340
 elements it lives on shock elements 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.000
 and it lives on exploration 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.710
 a completely crazy world only one 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.480
 garden spirit can have sprung in 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.850
 one constantly with new situations 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.940
 is confronted 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.790
 So no one expects me here 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.240
 vice president evil 4 ballast iges action 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.310
 game 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.440
 on the contrary, it is really true 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.500
 strongly limited what you amunition or 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.910
 to cure stories have you often 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.750
 You have to hide away to run away 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.520
 or even had no chance 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.980
 and very briefly about the reason for what 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.900
 is it going who am I where am I there you 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.560
 are the policeman sebastian kaster janus 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.590
 he is called to a crime scene 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.500
 there a lot of corpses and then becomes 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.830
 dejected and is from then on 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.660
 a real horror trip he then 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.920
 where he lives in principle all the time 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.720
 only on the curse and now 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.880
 need to find out my god what happens 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.940
 because here actually and that's it 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.530
 an element of the game so nasty falling 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.870
 you can create or drop yourself 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.330
 must stop trying just such a trap 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.310
 to escape or just not man 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.920
 can can create conspicuous even themselves 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.970
 imagine and stop opponents 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.150
 it has something completely new at least in the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.190
 segment everything never saw it 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.760
 is also very much so last second 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.500
 Rescue and now you are in one 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.120
 completely different situation must look something 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.660
 happens up here comes a bad one 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.160
 figure 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.750
 what does that want from me in the doubt that 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.970
 game itself is definitely not 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.090
 to run away but that well 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.090
 most exciting best game of the year
