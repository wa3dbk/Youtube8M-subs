talked about last week with your basic
slip<00:00:18.869> flow<00:00:19.230> reading<00:00:19.650> last<00:00:20.550> week<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.090> set<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.360> slip

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
slip flow reading last week I set a slip

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.510 
slip flow reading last week I set a slip
flow<00:00:21.930> trigger<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> four<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> half<00:00:23.160> foot

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
flow trigger on a four and a half foot

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.909 
flow trigger on a four and a half foot
rod<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.930> would<00:00:25.080> use<00:00:25.259> for<00:00:25.290> shallow<00:00:25.800> water

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
rod that we would use for shallow water

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.650 
rod that we would use for shallow water
crappie<00:00:26.340> fishing<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.970> spring<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.360> you<00:00:27.419> want

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
crappie fishing and spring if you want

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.429 
crappie fishing and spring if you want
to<00:00:27.720> pretend<00:00:27.960> event<00:00:28.290> on<00:00:28.380> over<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> brush<00:00:29.009> pop<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
to pretend event on over a brush pop and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
to pretend event on over a brush pop and
this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.680> really<00:00:32.130> good<00:00:32.250> way<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.490> do<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> but

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
this is a really good way to do it but

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.110 
this is a really good way to do it but
sometimes<00:00:34.160> especially<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.579> you're<00:00:35.730> catching

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
sometimes especially if you're catching

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.110 
sometimes especially if you're catching
a<00:00:36.210> lot<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> fish<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:37.829> lose<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.820> depth

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a lot of fish you will lose the depth

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.170 
a lot of fish you will lose the depth
that<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> set<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.140> bobber<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.940> catch

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that you set your bobber at if you catch

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.680 
that you set your bobber at if you catch
a<00:00:42.270> couple<00:00:42.449> of<00:00:42.629> fish<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:45.239> fish<00:00:45.270> are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
a couple of fish because the fish are

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.479 
a couple of fish because the fish are
pulling<00:00:46.050> against<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.859> reel<00:00:47.280> your

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
pulling against and you reel your

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.090 
pulling against and you reel your
stopper<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> end<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.440> rod<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
stopper up to the end of your rod it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
stopper up to the end of your rod it
will<00:00:50.309> actually<00:00:50.699> ride<00:00:50.969> down<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> line<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
will actually ride down the line just a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.319 
will actually ride down the line just a
little<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.769> and<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.699> next<00:00:53.730> thing<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> know

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
little bit and the next thing you know

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
little bit and the next thing you know
you've<00:00:54.510> lost<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.989> magic<00:00:55.559> depth<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.219> you're

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you've lost that magic depth that you're

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.970 
you've lost that magic depth that you're
actually<00:00:56.579> catching<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> fish<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.559> one

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
actually catching the fish at so one

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.160 
actually catching the fish at so one
thing<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> have<00:01:00.000> found<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
thing that I have found there is a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.880 
thing that I have found there is a
little<00:01:01.800> bit<00:01:01.949> new<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.460> me<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:04.110> I've<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.800> had

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
little bit new to me but I've really had

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.260 
little bit new to me but I've really had
a<00:01:04.949> lot<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.190> good<00:01:05.370> successes

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
a lot of good successes

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420 
a lot of good successes
instead<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.050> fishing<00:01:07.410> my<00:01:07.530> slip<00:01:07.860> floats<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.400> a

four and a half foot rod I gone to an
eight<00:01:13.560> foot<00:01:13.979> rod<00:01:14.280> alright<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.900> this

advantage of the 8 foot rod is where

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.980 
advantage of the 8 foot rod is where
most<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.110> us<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.530> used<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.579> using<00:01:20.720> rods<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
most of us are not used to using rods of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.980 
most of us are not used to using rods of
this<00:01:22.140> size<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:22.880> once<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.180> used<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.930> a

this size but once you get used to it a
little<00:01:25.140> bit<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.680> very<00:01:25.799> easy<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.700> handle

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
little bit it's very easy to handle

mount that advantage of the 8 foot rod
is<00:01:29.820> once<00:01:30.720> I've<00:01:30.930> set<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.560> depth<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.790> slip

is once I've set my depth with my slip
float<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:34.520> can<00:01:35.520> catch<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.570> much<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.259> 8<00:01:37.649> foot<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
line on 8 feet and I don't have to worry

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.139 
line on 8 feet and I don't have to worry
about<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.320> bobber<00:01:43.680> stop<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> up

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
about the bobber stop going up in the up

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
about the bobber stop going up in the up
in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.560> eyes<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.100> losing<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.790> depth

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
in the eyes and actually losing my depth

in the eyes and actually losing my depth
the<00:01:48.780> 8<00:01:48.990> foot<00:01:49.200> rod<00:01:49.469> is<00:01:49.619> great<00:01:49.950> especially<00:01:50.250> if

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the 8 foot rod is great especially if

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.999 
the 8 foot rod is great especially if
you're<00:01:50.610> close<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.539> cover<00:01:52.009> you're

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you're close to your cover you're

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.319 
you're close to your cover you're
actually<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> use<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.969> little<00:01:54.240> bit

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
actually just going to use a little bit

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.179 
actually just going to use a little bit
of<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.539> flipping<00:01:54.990> maneuver<00:01:55.469> just<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:56.039> you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
of a flipping maneuver just like you

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
of a flipping maneuver just like you
would<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.520> you're<00:01:56.670> flipping<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.210> jigging

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
would do if you're flipping a jigging

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
would do if you're flipping a jigging
bass<00:01:57.810> fish<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.340> great<00:01:59.579> thing<00:01:59.909> with

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
bass fish and the great thing with

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.070 
bass fish and the great thing with
longer<00:02:00.899> rods<00:02:01.140> they're<00:02:01.469> actually

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
longer rods they're actually
