couple months well it all depends on who
is<00:02:50.010> actually<00:02:50.190> developing<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.060> game<00:02:51.300> rumors

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
is making the next battlefield game so

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.010 
is making the next battlefield game so
they<00:02:56.370> might<00:02:56.550> be<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> bit<00:02:56.940> sloppy<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.600> designing

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
they might be a bit sloppy in designing

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.020 
they might be a bit sloppy in designing
it<00:02:58.290> now<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.830> personally<00:02:59.460> would<00:02:59.640> have<00:02:59.730> liked<00:02:59.910> to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
it now I personally would have liked to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.850 
it now I personally would have liked to
see<00:03:00.180> dice<00:03:00.420> make<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.930> next<00:03:01.110> game<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:01.800> do

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
see dice make the next game but they do

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.470 
see dice make the next game but they do
have<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.130> lot<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.340> their<00:03:02.580> plate<00:03:02.850> right<00:03:03.060> now<00:03:03.090> with

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
have a lot on their plate right now with

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.500 
have a lot on their plate right now with
mirrors<00:03:04.170> edge<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.680> star<00:03:04.950> wars<00:03:04.980> battlefront

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
mirrors edge and star wars battlefront

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.970 
mirrors edge and star wars battlefront
so<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.540> highly<00:03:06.900> doubt<00:03:07.200> they<00:03:07.260> will<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.740> any

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
so I highly doubt they will have any

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.160 
so I highly doubt they will have any
time<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.490> even<00:03:08.670> supervise<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.570> development

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
time to even supervise the development

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.320 
time to even supervise the development
of<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.470> next<00:03:10.709> battlefield<00:03:11.010> title<00:03:11.580> however<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
of the next battlefield title however I

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.300 
of the next battlefield title however I
think<00:03:12.510> EA<00:03:12.870> will<00:03:13.200> not<00:03:13.350> make<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.709> same<00:03:13.740> mistake

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
think EA will not make the same mistake

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.860 
think EA will not make the same mistake
twice<00:03:14.340> when<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.000> comes<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.330> releasing<00:03:15.780> an

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
twice when it comes to releasing an

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.320 
twice when it comes to releasing an
unfinished<00:03:16.260> product<00:03:16.740> they<00:03:17.430> did<00:03:17.670> take<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.940> large

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
unfinished product they did take a large

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.510 
unfinished product they did take a large
hit<00:03:18.600> with<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> downfall<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.410> battlefield<00:03:20.220> 4

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
hit with the downfall of battlefield 4

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.190 
hit with the downfall of battlefield 4
so<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.060> doubt<00:03:21.360> they<00:03:21.540> want<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> do<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> same

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
so I doubt they want to do the same

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.930 
so I doubt they want to do the same
thing<00:03:22.440> with<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.620> next<00:03:22.920> battlefield<00:03:23.220> title<00:03:23.760> I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
thing with the next battlefield title I

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.670 
thing with the next battlefield title I
guess<00:03:24.540> we<00:03:24.690> will<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.320> wait<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.500> see

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
guess we will just have to wait and see

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.250 
guess we will just have to wait and see

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
not only fun but balanced as well now

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
doubt battlefield will last for the next

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.390 
doubt battlefield will last for the next
ten<00:04:57.300> years<00:04:57.440> now<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.470> next<00:04:58.770> question<00:04:58.980> comes

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
ten years now the next question comes

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.520 
ten years now the next question comes
from<00:04:59.670> Jack<00:05:00.090> skull<00:05:00.390> crack<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.930> he<00:05:01.050> said<00:05:01.320> I

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
from Jack skull crack and he said I

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.530 
from Jack skull crack and he said I
think<00:05:01.980> there<00:05:02.130> will<00:05:02.190> be<00:05:02.250> dinos<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.120> final

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
think there will be dinos in the final

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.410 
think there will be dinos in the final
stand<00:05:03.810> DLC<00:05:04.650> okay<00:05:05.640> so<00:05:05.700> I<00:05:05.850> think<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.210> would<00:05:06.300> be<00:05:06.390> a

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
stand DLC okay so I think it would be a

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.390 
stand DLC okay so I think it would be a
cool<00:05:06.810> game<00:05:07.080> mode<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.470> incorporate<00:05:08.100> but<00:05:08.310> it

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
cool game mode to incorporate but it

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.100 
cool game mode to incorporate but it
just<00:05:08.580> doesn't<00:05:08.760> make<00:05:09.030> any<00:05:09.090> sense<00:05:09.480> for<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:09.900> be

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
just doesn't make any sense for it to be

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.350 
just doesn't make any sense for it to be

rubberband<00:06:47.850> dick<00:06:48.030> bug<00:06:48.240> so<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:48.870> do<00:06:48.960> have<00:06:49.260> hope

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
rubberband dick bug so I do have hope

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.380 
rubberband dick bug so I do have hope
for<00:06:49.470> battlefield<00:06:50.070> 4<00:06:50.400> dice<00:06:50.730> just<00:06:51.030> needs<00:06:51.270> to

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
for battlefield 4 dice just needs to

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.900 
for battlefield 4 dice just needs to
hurry<00:06:51.600> up<00:06:51.690> and<00:06:51.870> fix<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.320> game<00:06:52.560> now<00:06:53.400> I<00:06:53.430> think<00:06:53.790> if

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
hurry up and fix the game now I think if

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.850 
hurry up and fix the game now I think if
they<00:06:54.030> increase<00:06:54.390> the<00:06:54.690> tick<00:06:54.960> rate<00:06:55.169> on<00:06:55.350> servers

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
they increase the tick rate on servers

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.260 
they increase the tick rate on servers
the<00:06:56.040> game<00:06:56.190> would<00:06:56.340> improve<00:06:56.669> a<00:06:56.820> lot<00:06:56.970> more

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
the game would improve a lot more

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.330 
the game would improve a lot more
basically<00:06:58.200> the<00:06:58.380> tick<00:06:58.620> right<00:06:58.830> measures<00:06:59.160> how

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
basically the tick right measures how

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.610 
basically the tick right measures how
fast<00:06:59.370> a<00:06:59.850> server<00:07:00.060> updates<00:07:00.570> itself<00:07:00.930> so<00:07:01.470> the

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
fast a server updates itself so the

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.529 
fast a server updates itself so the
higher<00:07:01.740> the<00:07:02.010> number<00:07:02.130> the<00:07:02.280> better<00:07:02.430> so<00:07:03.180> overall

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
higher the number the better so overall

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.420 
higher the number the better so overall
I<00:07:03.690> do<00:07:03.870> have<00:07:04.169> a<00:07:04.229> lot<00:07:04.440> of<00:07:04.470> hope<00:07:04.770> for<00:07:04.800> this<00:07:05.160> game

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
I do have a lot of hope for this game

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.040 
I do have a lot of hope for this game
