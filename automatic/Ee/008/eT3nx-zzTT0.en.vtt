00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.590
 girls new video today video of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.250
 February finished products are dressed 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.020
 makeup 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.400
 in the same way as the previous video 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.580
 because in the other video I recorded 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.470
 only inside and given 22 mica I have a lot 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.539
 time to record videos for you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.849
 as you know I love this type of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.310
 video therefore and monthly is an obligation 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.769
 to do so and also many more this month 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 interesting products to show you the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.660
 first of which I want to talk about this 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.840
 soap here of forever and I must say 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.149
 girl I really like is a lot 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 delicate on the skin is not much 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.469
 scented because just the inside and not 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.989
 contains parabens fragrances silicones cetri 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.879
 zither but it is very very delicate and very 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.770
 moisturizing so definitely it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.449
 I will buy another finished product 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 for the face and this distilled water 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.260
 to roses or tonic I more than water 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.059
 distilled for me is a tonic and I have it 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.650
 finished after a long time we have it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 open because we say it was also 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.600
 a small lynx discovery is not gods 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.729
 better though I have to say that I like it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.630
 very much because it really is my skin 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.240
 it is much more hydrated and I like it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.220
 the scent of rose so I finished it 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 I'll wait to remember to buy it because 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.509
 I want to try other tones then I'm done 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.600
 two packs of cotton pads 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.579
 of the usual 120 serial diskettes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.130
 and these are the ones that exist 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.930
 70 and these here of the stretch cost 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 more than these that there are 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.180
 120 depends on where I am, though 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.009
 I always use these two I finished the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.870
 my usual intimate cleanser this 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.660
 so a rom and obviously true 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.480
 the usual toothpaste with maxi rates 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.130
 white this livia body balm below 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.280
 the shower then for dry skin 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.010
 with shea butter genuinely of 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.210
 this product I was expecting a little something 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.100
 more in the sense that it does not have me 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.710
 one hundred percent convinced per hour 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.020
 initially I loved it there 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.570
 I used it often to my skin 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.950
 beautiful moisturized then I thought the comfortable 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.840
 because anyway being under the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 shower you pass the cream as if it were 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.440
 a podium shading the body and in theory 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.100
 after that you don't need the first one 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.690
 moisturizer with me does not work 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.150
 let me know if it has done with you too 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.370
 the same thing because I over me 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.830
 honestly I noticed this thing 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.560
 I do n't draka them, that is why you smell me 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.990
 I love the classic perfume of the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.090
 Libyan fragrance however does not hydrate one 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.310
 city ​​so I don't think I'll buy it again 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.230
 I then finished this body we create here 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.720
 of the neutrogena to which this formula 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.030
 Norwegian for dry skin and this one 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.250
 instead unlike the new york below 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.020
 I loved the shower 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.090
 you know that neutrogena products are 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.760
 truly phenomenal they cost a little 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.030
 but they really have hydration 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.130
 deep and I also like perfume 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.840
 so it's a hydration then that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.060
 persists during the day so not 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.940
 is that after two hours the cream disappears of 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.950
 new dry skin so if it happens to you 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.650
 surely I will buy it again 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.160
 then this body scrub this here 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.530
 I had the channels taken and it is with pins 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.690
 apple seemed like a fruit then pineapple e 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.170
 passion fruit to a body scrub 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.000
 exfoliating while I'm doing it 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.350
 French and Italian Spanish minister 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.030
 however exfoliating logic body scrub for 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.590
 the body 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.590
 in here there were 230 mm 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.650
 the product I made a huge effort 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.140
 to finish it because it took me almost a 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.810
 year and a half does not expire less badly 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.700
 anyway it's not like it took me so long 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.110
 the fragrance because anas is anyway 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.750
 fruit the passion especially now 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.760
 that there are these days where he does 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.340
 warm, however, where the sun was, it was more 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.739
 indicated however being that I have the skin 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.870
 so dry I need a scrub 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.480
 body with the larger than a little larger 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.459
 and so this was just an exchange here 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.130
 body that slid away on my skin 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.440
 and so I finished it right for not 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.170
 then throw it away I passed it over your body 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.730
 but it didn't scrub too 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.530
 so the next time i am 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.489
 I will find this product in front not it 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.290
 re purchase 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.910
 but I repeat not for the fragrance but 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.549
 just because he had so much granules 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.010
 little ones that he really didn't do about me 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.870
 I finished nothing in these plasters 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.539
 here of the average that practically go to 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.650
 remove blackheads are years that 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.139
 I have to say that purchases are essential 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.479
 if you still have light black spots if 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.340
 Go at least every 2 to 3 months 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.690
 facial cleansing by these beautician 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.660
 here they can help you 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.810
 of course if you have big blackheads 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.940
 so these guys do not do anything I 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.260
 I do it once every 2 3 weeks there 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.630
 step on the nose because they are there 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.250
 inside certini whether to have the nose either 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.910
 for the forehead and chin then for the area 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.340
 t and on me they do I finished then 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.440
 this cream hydro satèn of green 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.750
 oasis that had sent me site arc 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.780
 cosmetics and I must say I liked it 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.220
 a lot does not seem repetitive but me 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.169
 I have dry skin so you need one 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.270
 product that really suits me a lot 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.070
 nourishing the skin is precisely this one 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.680
 loved it 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.120
 I will still do a more review for you 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.610
 In depth of these creams I am 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.410
 testing anti-cellulite creams though 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.150
 this one for the face really is me 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.039
 liked a lot to finish I have 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.599
 finished this little sample that 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.870
 they gave me a mask 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.849
 Peppermint of lush as you know one of 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.680
 my really favorite masks because 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.139
 especially with many imperfections 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.220
 so points nor pimples goes 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.950
 completely to do an action 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.230
 exfoliating on 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.000
 and completely removes everything I know 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.550
 maybe when I'm under a cycle I have 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.380
 really a lot the pimples 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.990
 mask and the only mask 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.640
 which precisely makes my pimples dry 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.470
 so surely when i go by 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.030
 let me buy her back no girls 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.250
 so these are all products that me 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.230
 I finished in February as 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.060

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.310

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.230

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.230
