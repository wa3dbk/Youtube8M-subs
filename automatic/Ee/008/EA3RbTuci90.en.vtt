00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
certainly known for your comedic

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.100 
certainly known for your comedic
performances<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.420> knew<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.659> might<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
performances and I knew this might be a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.450 
performances and I knew this might be a
departure<00:01:52.530> from<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.009> normally<00:01:53.130> do

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
departure from what you normally do

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980 
departure from what you normally do
being<00:01:53.670> live-action<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> watch<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
being live-action but when I watch it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.209 
being live-action but when I watch it
last<00:01:55.170> night<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:55.829> equal<00:01:56.189> parts

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
last night I think it's equal parts

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.580 
last night I think it's equal parts
comedy<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> live-action<00:01:57.750> there's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.409> lot

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
comedy and live-action there's a lot

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
comedy and live-action there's a lot
more<00:01:58.710> humor<00:01:59.040> than<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> anticipated<00:01:59.549> yeah

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
more humor than I anticipated yeah

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.429 
more humor than I anticipated yeah
there's<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> lot<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:00.719> humor<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> movie

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
there's a lot more humor in the movie

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.510 
there's a lot more humor in the movie
overall<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.600> me<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.740> got<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> play<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
overall and for me I got to play a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
overall and for me I got to play a
comedic<00:02:05.880> part<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.570> different<00:02:06.930> way<00:02:07.020> than

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
comedic part but in a different way than

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.559 
comedic part but in a different way than
that<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.979> normally

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
that I normally

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.080 
that I normally
I<00:02:08.599> think<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.579> certainly<00:02:10.579> starting<00:02:10.909> with<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I think that certainly starting with the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.880 
I think that certainly starting with the
Millers<00:02:11.390> last<00:02:11.689> year<00:02:11.900> my<00:02:12.049> TV<00:02:12.349> show<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.530> got<00:02:12.799> to
