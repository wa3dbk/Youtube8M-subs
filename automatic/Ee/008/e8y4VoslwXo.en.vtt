00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.899
 well this opportunity I'm going to show you 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.950
 the entire function using excel 2010 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.900
 This function 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.830
 redon of an excellent number or less 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.890
 closest the syntax is as follows 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.900
 we place the entire function and enter 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.740
 parentheses we put the argument that 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.370
 will come to be a real number let's see a 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.590
 example 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.200
 let's calculate the whole numbers of 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.850
 the following real values we are going to 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.860
 do the whole of 3.15 then 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.520
 we select the cell and we put the same 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.700
 whole 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.860
 and in parentheses we place the value or 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.140
 the cell where the real number is 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.350
 stole parentheses and feels 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.630
 then the integer of 3.15 stress is 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.260
 say the approximate 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.500
 to the nearest ether or lower 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.700
 let's calculate the integer of 3 23.56 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.760
 let's put the same in the cell we put 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.920
 whole 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.580
 in parentheses and we select the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.290
 cell stole parentheses and entered the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.290
 whole in this case it would be 23 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.350
 let's calculate the integer of 4 in this 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.350
 case will be the same then whole 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:35.700
 of 4 we close parentheses enter and he 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:39.150
 delivered 4 would be 4 we will also go in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.600
 the whole of minus 23.45 we put the same 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.180
 whole 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.180
 we open parentheses we select 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.770
 in the cell where we are going to calculate the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.830
 whole sermon for the 17th therefore the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.570
 whole with approximation to the whole 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.070
 minus 23.35 is minus 24 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.040
 this function is also called 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.479
 maximum whole good would be all not 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.479
