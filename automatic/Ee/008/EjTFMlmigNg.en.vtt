00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.420
 IPhone 5s in the model's launch on September 20th is coming Apple iPhone 5s 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.110
 It's expected news came out holding the attention will be 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.920
 Oh, is it really true this time Apple's products 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.840
 Because there are so many rumor stories about the iPhone. 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 4 Forbes Internet edition of the American economic magazine 1 International Business Times 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.189
 This is how I communicated with Dave Smith, the editor of technology. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:37.680
 According to this article, Smith's editor-in-chief, 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:43.050
 I'm analyzing it with the launch pattern of iOS6, Apple's operating system. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 iOS6 was released 100 days after its release and iOS6 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.329
 I was on iPhone 5g in two days. 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.110
 If you apply this same flow, then 100 plus is the formula 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.600
 It's possible 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:03.989
 That is, the 100th day after iOS7 is announced , 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.400
 If you add two more days to it, Apple's new 21 smartphone will be released 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.229
 It's expected. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.610
 In this regard, Forbes pointed out that Apple does not 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.500
 And it gives the impression of Smith's editorial prospect 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:24.030
 Taken together, the appearance of the iPhone 5s handed down so far and the iPhone 5c 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.470
 The design is similar to the new mobile application processor and dual LED 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.299
 Flash mounting 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.950
 And with increased battery capacity and home button fingerprint recognition 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.720
 Expected 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:42.240
 Oh, especially the iPhone 5s is a sapphire with a strength comparable to diamonds 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:47.820
 The built-in crystal prevents scratches on the home button and malfunction of the fingerprint sensor 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.130
 It was known to be i think whatever hand iPhone model clause after 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.590
 It is expected that similar indeyo 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:01.110
 What does this mean for a child's iPhone 5s? 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:06.960
 Iphone 3gs s meant for speed iphone 4s s c 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:13.230
 Personally , I would expect the sensor to be a sapphire. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.290
 How about you, my sisters, it was a cover story 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.290
 Ah
