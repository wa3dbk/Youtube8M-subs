whatever<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:34.350> really<00:04:35.350> like<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:35.680> because<00:04:35.950> you

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
whatever I really like this because you

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.640 
whatever I really like this because you
could<00:04:36.430> also<00:04:36.550> use<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:37.240> in<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:38.110> bunch<00:04:38.560> of

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
could also use it in a bunch of

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.400 
could also use it in a bunch of
different<00:04:39.010> ways<00:04:39.190> you<00:04:39.840> don't<00:04:40.840> have<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.170> only

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
different ways you don't have to only

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.050 
different ways you don't have to only
use<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.890> that<00:04:42.040> way<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.250> can<00:04:42.490> use<00:04:42.670> it<00:04:42.820> with

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
use it that way you can use it with

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.770 
use it that way you can use it with
cases<00:04:44.040> thin<00:04:45.040> cases<00:04:45.580> they<00:04:45.790> will<00:04:46.000> fit<00:04:46.210> in<00:04:46.330> here<00:04:46.600> I

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
cases thin cases they will fit in here I

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.150 
cases thin cases they will fit in here I
had<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:48.420> contour<00:04:49.420> flick<00:04:49.750> out<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:50.260> show<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.530> it

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
had the contour flick out to show you it

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.970 
had the contour flick out to show you it
was<00:04:51.370> on<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.640> phone<00:04:51.820> already<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.740> take

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
was on the phone already you can take

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.970 
was on the phone already you can take
this<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.490> just<00:04:54.990> pop<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.170> in<00:04:56.260> there<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.620> will

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
this and just pop it in there it will

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.970 
this and just pop it in there it will
fit<00:04:57.310> because<00:04:58.270> these<00:04:58.480> are<00:04:58.720> rubberized<00:04:59.650> they

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
fit because these are rubberized they

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.300 
fit because these are rubberized they
will<00:05:00.190> stretch<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:01.170> you<00:05:02.170> know<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.470> contours<00:05:03.310> of

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
will stretch to you know the contours of

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.180 
will stretch to you know the contours of
the<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.880> any<00:05:04.510> thin<00:05:04.810> case<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.300> SBP

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
the of any thin case this is the SBP

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.510 
the of any thin case this is the SBP
case<00:05:09.360> really<00:05:10.360> thin<00:05:10.800> fits<00:05:11.800> in<00:05:12.040> there<00:05:12.280> like<00:05:12.490> a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
case really thin fits in there like a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.270 
case really thin fits in there like a
charm<00:05:15.180> i<00:05:16.180> also<00:05:16.780> have<00:05:17.110> an<00:05:17.260> incase<00:05:17.620> slider<00:05:17.830> here

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
charm i also have an incase slider here

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.330 
charm i also have an incase slider here
one<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.640> thicker<00:05:18.910> cases<00:05:19.620> now<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:21.040> won't

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
one of the thicker cases now this won't

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.240 
one of the thicker cases now this won't
won't<00:05:22.120> necessarily<00:05:22.540> fit<00:05:23.320> in<00:05:23.470> properly<00:05:26.130> see<00:05:27.130> it

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
won't necessarily fit in properly see it

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.810 
won't necessarily fit in properly see it
pops<00:05:28.060> out<00:05:28.270> but<00:05:28.750> because<00:05:29.470> you<00:05:29.620> can<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:30.310> does<00:05:30.610> you

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
pops out but because you can it does you

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.170 
pops out but because you can it does you
know<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:33.130> does<00:05:33.310> give<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.760> little<00:05:33.910> to

believe it went down twenty dollars to
48<00:06:33.880> so<00:06:34.840> as<00:06:35.050> of<00:06:35.230> right<00:06:35.290> now<00:06:36.270> or<00:06:37.270> last<00:06:38.140> time<00:06:38.290> I

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
48 so as of right now or last time I

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.360 
48 so as of right now or last time I
checked<00:06:38.500> it<00:06:38.830> $48<00:06:39.610> is<00:06:39.820> on<00:06:39.970> sale

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
checked it $48 is on sale

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.969 
checked it $48 is on sale
so<00:06:40.790> go<00:06:40.880> check<00:06:41.060> them<00:06:41.240> out<00:06:41.360> I<00:06:41.990> think<00:06:42.860> it's
