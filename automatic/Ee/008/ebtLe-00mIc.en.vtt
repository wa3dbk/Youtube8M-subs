00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
holding in one hand doing a wee loop

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.130 
holding in one hand doing a wee loop
onto<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.709> tail<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:38.730> taking<00:03:39.180> one<00:03:39.390> slightly

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
onto that tail then taking one slightly

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.110 
onto that tail then taking one slightly
smaller<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.800> left<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.459> then<00:03:41.940> one

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
smaller to the left and then one

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.320 
smaller to the left and then one
slightly<00:03:42.540> smaller<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.890> right<00:03:44.160> pull<00:03:45.030> that

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
slightly smaller to the right pull that

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.460 
slightly smaller to the right pull that
around<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.590> get<00:03:47.430> sharp<00:03:47.910> scissors<00:03:48.660> cut

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
around like that get sharp scissors cut

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.370 
around like that get sharp scissors cut
that<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.459> then<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:51.570> it's<00:03:51.720> easier

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
that and then just because it's easier

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.130 
that and then just because it's easier
get<00:03:52.680> your<00:03:52.920> staple<00:03:53.490> and<00:03:53.700> staple<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.840> there

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
get your staple and staple that there

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.960 
get your staple and staple that there
and<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.709> make<00:03:55.860> sure<00:03:55.890> you've<00:03:56.250> got<00:03:56.430> all<00:03:56.550> of<00:03:56.880> those

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
and to make sure you've got all of those

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.340 
and to make sure you've got all of those
we<00:03:57.180> loops<00:03:57.390> because<00:03:57.510> there'll<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:57.810> nothing

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
we loops because there'll be nothing

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.110 
we loops because there'll be nothing
worse<00:03:58.530> than<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:58.890> falling<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.340> pieces<00:03:59.400> right

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
worse than it falling to pieces right

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.630 
worse than it falling to pieces right
the<00:04:00.330> next<00:04:00.600> thing<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.900> do<00:04:01.050> is<00:04:01.290> see<00:04:02.250> what<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.430> mean

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the next thing to do is see what I mean

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.820 
the next thing to do is see what I mean
by<00:04:02.910> not<00:04:03.120> getting<00:04:03.840> all<00:04:04.110> your<00:04:04.290> loops<00:04:04.440> otherwise

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
by not getting all your loops otherwise

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.410 
by not getting all your loops otherwise
that<00:04:05.010> are<00:04:05.100> all<00:04:05.220> come<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.610> pieces<00:04:05.970> oh<00:04:06.120> we<00:04:06.300> don't

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
that are all come to pieces oh we don't

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.600 
that are all come to pieces oh we don't
want<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.990> that's<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.380> bit<00:04:07.500> shoddy<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
want that that's a bit shoddy and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.030 
want that that's a bit shoddy and
sharpie<00:04:09.360> right<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.200> too<00:04:10.470> there<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.950> I'm

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
sharpie right that too there and I'm

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.290 
sharpie right that too there and I'm
going<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.280> have<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.489> staple<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:12.000> again

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
going to have to staple that again

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.050 
going to have to staple that again
because<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.959> want<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.230> all<00:04:13.440> stay<00:04:13.860> together<00:04:14.100> then

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
because I want it all stay together then

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.420 
because I want it all stay together then
what<00:04:15.600> you<00:04:15.750> do<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.380> get<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.620> little<00:04:16.950> bit<00:04:17.190> blue

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
what you do is you get a little bit blue

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.229 
what you do is you get a little bit blue
put<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.330> glue<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.810> there<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.440> then<00:04:20.280> take

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
put that glue on there and then take

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.430 
put that glue on there and then take
that<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.500> put<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:24.240> under<00:04:24.990> there

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
that and put this in under there

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.700 
that and put this in under there
like<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.130> look<00:04:27.730> at<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.450> huge<00:04:29.170> right<00:04:29.680> now

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
like so look at this so huge right now

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.890 
like so look at this so huge right now
that<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.670> era<00:04:30.850> studies<00:04:31.300> left<00:04:31.510> did<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.750> see

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
that the era studies left did you see

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.540 
that the era studies left did you see
how<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.050> was<00:04:32.320> starting<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.740> left<00:04:33.160> because

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
how that was starting to left because

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.540 
how that was starting to left because
it's<00:04:33.700> too<00:04:33.910> hilly<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:35.020> get<00:04:35.290> your<00:04:35.410> glue<00:04:35.680> gun<00:04:35.710> go

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
it's too hilly just get your glue gun go

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.480 
it's too hilly just get your glue gun go
into<00:04:37.060> there<00:04:37.240> like<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:37.930> put<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.800> drop<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.220> glue

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
into there like that put a drop of glue

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.630 
into there like that put a drop of glue
on<00:04:39.790> there<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.210> then<00:04:40.750> push<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.560> down<00:04:42.250> and

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
on there and then push that down and

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.430 
on there and then push that down and
into<00:04:43.030> place<00:04:43.470> leave<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:45.520> alone<00:04:45.940> until<00:04:46.420> it<00:04:47.290> has

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
into place leave it alone until it has

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.020 
into place leave it alone until it has
completely<00:04:48.210> sit<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.540> then<00:04:50.290> we<00:04:50.890> are<00:04:51.070> ready<00:04:51.340> to

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
completely sit and then we are ready to

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.270 
completely sit and then we are ready to
put<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.330> onto<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.930> rust<00:04:53.200> now<00:04:53.680> we<00:04:53.740> on<00:04:54.010> is

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
put it onto the rust now we on is

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.130 
put it onto the rust now we on is
everybody<00:04:54.730> on<00:04:54.790> we're<00:04:55.120> all<00:04:55.240> in<00:04:55.480> location

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
everybody on we're all in location

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.360 
everybody on we're all in location
perfect<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:57.340> then<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.940> would<00:04:58.690> just<00:04:58.750> get<00:04:59.370> tied

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
perfect so then that would just get tied

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.510 
perfect so then that would just get tied
around<00:05:00.730> there<00:05:01.390> like<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.620> then<00:05:03.190> once

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
around there like so and then once

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.670 
around there like so and then once
you've<00:05:03.700> done<00:05:03.850> your<00:05:03.910> Weibo<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:05.050> can<00:05:05.230> just<00:05:05.440> cut

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
you've done your Weibo you can just cut

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.980 
you've done your Weibo you can just cut
those<00:05:05.860> extra<00:05:06.400> long<00:05:06.580> threads<00:05:07.030> off<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.630> the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
those extra long threads off and the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.480 
those extra long threads off and the
other<00:05:08.200> thing<00:05:08.470> I<00:05:08.560> need<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.860> tell<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.370> because

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
other thing I need to tell you because

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.520 
other thing I need to tell you because
this<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:09.880> little<00:05:10.120> crap<00:05:10.720> for<00:05:10.960> young<00:05:11.140> players

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
this is a little crap for young players

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.030 
this is a little crap for young players
if<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.760> glue<00:05:13.060> is<00:05:13.420> yes<00:05:14.410> sometimes<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:14.890> might

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
if the glue is yes sometimes you might

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.800 
if the glue is yes sometimes you might
not<00:05:15.190> be<00:05:15.340> able<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.520> see<00:05:15.670> that<00:05:15.790> but<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:16.000> can<00:05:16.330> the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
not be able to see that but I can the

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.160 
not be able to see that but I can the
glue<00:05:17.350> has<00:05:17.920> these<00:05:18.130> long<00:05:18.600> little<00:05:19.600> things<00:05:19.900> that

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
glue has these long little things that

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.380 
glue has these long little things that
look<00:05:20.410> like<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.680> spider's<00:05:21.250> web<00:05:21.430> just<00:05:21.970> pull<00:05:22.210> those

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
look like a spider's web just pull those

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.180 
look like a spider's web just pull those
off<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.810> then<00:05:23.320> that<00:05:23.530> could<00:05:23.680> go<00:05:23.860> into<00:05:24.070> a

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
off and then that could go into a

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.390 
off and then that could go into a
beautiful<00:05:25.150> beautiful<00:05:25.560> little<00:05:26.560> box<00:05:26.890> and<00:05:27.220> it's

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
beautiful beautiful little box and it's

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.700 
beautiful beautiful little box and it's
ready<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:28.060> present<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.900> girl<00:05:29.170> will<00:05:29.440> think
