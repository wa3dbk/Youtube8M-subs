00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.210 
all right so today I have a video on how
to<00:00:03.899> install<00:00:04.879> tachometer<00:00:06.200> which<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.620> this

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
to install tachometer which is the this

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.220 
to install tachometer which is the this
guy<00:00:08.400> right<00:00:08.610> here<00:00:08.639> measures<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.420> rpm<00:00:09.809> rates<00:00:10.050> on

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
guy right here measures the rpm rates on

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.089 
guy right here measures the rpm rates on
your<00:00:10.380> car<00:00:11.059> on<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.300> gloves<00:00:12.809> will<00:00:13.740> apply<00:00:14.040> to

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
your car on and gloves will apply to

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.580 
your car on and gloves will apply to
almost<00:00:14.429> every<00:00:14.790> car<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.420> 1982<00:00:16.230> Ford

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
almost every car but this is a 1982 Ford

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.490 
almost every car but this is a 1982 Ford
f-150<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> six-cylinder<00:00:18.270> engine<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.380> it's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
f-150 with a six-cylinder engine so it's

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.519 
f-150 with a six-cylinder engine so it's
a<00:00:19.590> v6<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.720> already<00:00:22.410> have

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a v6 so the first thing I already have

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.410 
a v6 so the first thing I already have
it<00:00:22.650> installed<00:00:22.970> because<00:00:23.970> that'll<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.359> make

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
it installed because that'll just make

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.529 
it installed because that'll just make
the<00:00:24.630> video<00:00:24.869> tutorial<00:00:25.650> easier<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.449> how

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the video tutorial easier so you see how

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.019 
the video tutorial easier so you see how
the<00:00:27.599> mounting<00:00:28.050> bracket<00:00:28.439> then<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.519> screw<00:00:29.849> has

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the mounting bracket then this screw has

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.170 
the mounting bracket then this screw has
to<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:31.320> about<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> quarter<00:00:31.769> inch<00:00:32.180> because

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
to be just about a quarter inch because

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
to be just about a quarter inch because
if<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.899> too<00:00:34.050> long<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> mess<00:00:35.309> up

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
if it's too long it's going to mess up

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.600 
if it's too long it's going to mess up
the<00:00:36.260> end<00:00:37.260> enough<00:00:37.500> we'll<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.129> start<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the end enough we'll just start the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.369 
the end enough we'll just start the
collar<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:41.579> mounting<00:00:42.000> bracket<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.629> mean<00:00:43.230> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
collar this mounting bracket I mean it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
collar this mounting bracket I mean it's
all<00:00:43.739> put<00:00:43.950> together

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.510 

as<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.790> kind<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:49.050> guy

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
as you can it just kind of like this guy

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.130 
as you can it just kind of like this guy
sits<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.030> tips<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.900> mounting

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
sits on here tips on the mounting

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.630 
sits on here tips on the mounting
bracket<00:00:52.470> then<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> screw<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.550> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
bracket then you screw this in when you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.590 
bracket then you screw this in when you
adjust<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> slide

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
adjust it so you have to slide

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.030 
adjust it so you have to slide
everything<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> wires<00:00:55.410> before<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> do

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
everything on the wires before you do

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.520 
everything on the wires before you do
this<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.980> did<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.489> took<00:00:59.670> this

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
this and then what I did was took this

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.759 
this and then what I did was took this
casing<00:01:01.530> off<00:01:01.680> which<00:01:01.920> there's<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.610> screw

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
casing off which there's just one screw

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.870 
casing off which there's just one screw
underneath<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:06.530> picked<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.650> casing<00:01:08.100> off<00:01:08.220> ran

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
underneath I picked that casing off ran

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.020 
underneath I picked that casing off ran
the<00:01:09.000> wires<00:01:09.590> through<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.800> casing<00:01:11.250> laid<00:01:11.790> down

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the wires through this casing laid down

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.480 
the wires through this casing laid down
and<00:01:12.420> I'll<00:01:12.509> show<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.950> car

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.620 

you'll<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> wires<00:01:17.970> coming<00:01:18.300> out<00:01:18.450> right

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you'll see the wires coming out right

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.740 
you'll see the wires coming out right
there<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.520> come<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.570> they're

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
there then they come and then they're

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.219 
there then they come and then they're
taped<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.020> one

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
taped to the back there and the one

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.340 
taped to the back there and the one
green<00:01:25.530> wire<00:01:26.090> which<00:01:27.090> goes<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.539> engine<00:01:27.899> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
green wire which goes to the engine is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.900 
green wire which goes to the engine is
all<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:28.950> through<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.280> hole<00:01:29.340> which

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
all the way down through that hole which

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.930 
all the way down through that hole which
is<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> hardest<00:01:30.450> part<00:01:30.660> but<00:01:31.440> so<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
is the hardest part but so you got to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.460 
is the hardest part but so you got to
make<00:01:33.000> sure<00:01:33.149> your<00:01:33.300> ground<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.750> connected<00:01:33.899> good

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
make sure your ground is connected good

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
make sure your ground is connected good
that's<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.800> black<00:01:35.100> wire<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:36.000> up

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
that's this black wire which is going up

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.749 
that's this black wire which is going up
to<00:01:36.660> that<00:01:36.960> ground<00:01:37.320> point<00:01:37.649> see<00:01:38.580> how<00:01:38.640> it's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to that ground point see how it's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.430 
to that ground point see how it's
screwed<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> metal<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.960> had<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.289> make

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
screwed in with that metal I had to make

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.779 
screwed in with that metal I had to make
sure<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:40.979> connected<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.520> good

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
sure that that was connected really good

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.779 
sure that that was connected really good
is<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> first<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.840> wasn't<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.679> then<00:01:44.009> when

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
is that first it wasn't and then when

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.249 
is that first it wasn't and then when
you're<00:01:44.940> connecting<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.539> red<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:45.960> white

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you're connecting your red and white

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.010 
you're connecting your red and white
wire<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.490> red<00:01:47.729> wire<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.479> power<00:01:48.690> which

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
wire the red wire is the power which

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.839 
wire the red wire is the power which
always<00:01:49.259> needs<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.800> on<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.310> yellow<00:01:50.550> or

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
always needs to be on in the yellow or

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.570 
always needs to be on in the yellow or
in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> white<00:01:51.240> wire<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:52.039> delight<00:01:53.039> for<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
in the white wire is a delight for the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.400 
in the white wire is a delight for the
tachometer<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.330> just<00:01:54.450> did<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> easy

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
tachometer now I just did it the easy

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.139 
tachometer now I just did it the easy
way<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.979> connected<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.819> a<00:01:57.390> 30<00:01:58.080> amperage

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
way and connected it to a 30 amperage

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
way and connected it to a 30 amperage
fuse<00:02:00.149> which<00:02:00.810> makes<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> light<00:02:01.380> go<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.800> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.609 
fuse which makes the light go all the
way<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.190> all<00:02:02.459> the<00:02:02.729> time<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:03.720> don't<00:02:03.899> know<00:02:04.110> so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
way on all the time but I don't know so

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.029 
way on all the time but I don't know so
that's<00:02:04.800> right<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.110> bought<00:02:07.739> one<00:02:07.770> these

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that's right so I bought one these

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.279 
that's right so I bought one these
little<00:02:08.280> things<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.239> at<00:02:09.509> radiation<00:02:10.110> or

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
little things and it's at radiation or

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.800 
little things and it's at radiation or
not<00:02:10.470> ready<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.739> check<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.160> uh<00:02:11.300> autozone<00:02:12.300> has

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
not ready to check but uh autozone has

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.770 
not ready to check but uh autozone has
three<00:02:13.140> bucks<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.940> put<00:02:15.120> your<00:02:15.239> old<00:02:15.330> fuse<00:02:15.630> in

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
three bucks and you put your old fuse in

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.150 
three bucks and you put your old fuse in
and<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.930> put<00:02:16.110> your<00:02:16.200> new<00:02:16.349> fuse<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.069> it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and you put your new fuse in it and it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.030 
and you put your new fuse in it and it
leads<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:18.180> crimp<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.230> put<00:02:19.470> your

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
leads out to a crimp that you put your

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.530 
leads out to a crimp that you put your
wires<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:20.849> crimp<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.209> down<00:02:21.239> with<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
wires in and just crimp it down with a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.479 
wires in and just crimp it down with a
pair<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> vise<00:02:21.989> grips<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:23.310> that's

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
pair of vise grips and then that's

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.540 
pair of vise grips and then that's
connected

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
connected

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.880 
connected
and<00:02:25.030> now<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.290> see<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.530> green<00:02:26.740> wire

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
and now so you can see the green wire

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.800 
and now so you can see the green wire
writing<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.550> back<00:02:27.730> I'm<00:02:28.390> gonna<00:02:28.600> show<00:02:28.690> you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
writing on the back I'm gonna show you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.240 
writing on the back I'm gonna show you
where<00:02:28.990> that<00:02:29.110> connected<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.920> engine

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
where that connected to engine

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:41.309 
where that connected to engine
department<00:02:30.670> right<00:02:30.730> now

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.369 

this<00:02:42.540> supposedly<00:02:43.540> was<00:02:43.689> supposed<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.989> take<00:02:44.170> 30

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
this supposedly was supposed to take 30

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.819 
this supposedly was supposed to take 30
minutes<00:02:44.829> I<00:02:44.980> took<00:02:45.519> me<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.849> long<00:02:46.030> time<00:02:46.829> just

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
minutes I took me a long time just

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.099 
minutes I took me a long time just
because<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.129> did<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> few<00:02:48.489> things<00:02:48.700> wrong<00:02:49.109> that's

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
because I did a few things wrong that's

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.470 
because I did a few things wrong that's
why<00:02:50.230> I'm<00:02:50.319> making<00:02:50.439> this<00:02:50.650> video<00:02:50.829> business<00:02:51.480> so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
why I'm making this video business so

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.690 
the oil filter but the guy behind camera
what<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:04.209> called<00:03:04.389> and<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:06.040> got<00:03:06.280> two<00:03:06.459> wires

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
what it's called and it's got two wires

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.180 
what it's called and it's got two wires
coming<00:03:06.939> out<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.299> it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
coming out of it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.300 
coming out of it
these<00:03:08.790> two<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.390> red<00:03:09.600> ones<00:03:09.810> green<00:03:10.110> one<00:03:10.530> but

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
these two it's a red ones green one but

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.410 
these two it's a red ones green one but
you're<00:03:11.430> going<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.580> want<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.820> do<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> want

to<00:03:12.450> take<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.780> green<00:03:13.050> wire<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.530> that's

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
to take that green wire and that's

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.380 
to take that green wire and that's
generally<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.250> all<00:03:14.400> six-cylinder<00:03:15.000> engines

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
generally on all six-cylinder engines

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.240 
generally on all six-cylinder engines
and<00:03:16.200> you're<00:03:16.320> gonna<00:03:16.410> use<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> crimp<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.130> they

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
and you're gonna use a crimp that they

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.570 
and you're gonna use a crimp that they
gave<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.960> one<00:03:18.960> right<00:03:19.170> here

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
gave you that one right here

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.470 
gave you that one right here
and<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.180> put<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:23.010> green<00:03:23.280> wire<00:03:23.520> there<00:03:24.270> was

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
and you put the green wire there was

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.050 
and you put the green wire there was
American

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.960 

put<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.900> green<00:03:28.140> wire<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:29.250> closed<00:03:29.640> in

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
put the green wire and then closed in

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.200 
put the green wire and then closed in
which<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:30.840> end<00:03:31.080> right<00:03:31.260> here<00:03:32.210> then

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
which is this end right here then

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.630 
which is this end right here then
closest<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:33.960> my<00:03:34.020> hand<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.950> then<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.340> put<00:03:35.520> your

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
closest on my hand and then you put your

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.390 
closest on my hand and then you put your
new<00:03:35.790> wire<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:37.200> other<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.710> one<00:03:38.250> that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
new wire in the other and one that

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.180 
new wire in the other and one that
hasn't<00:03:39.000> been<00:03:39.180> spliced<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.990> you<00:03:40.650> close<00:03:40.920> this

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
hasn't been spliced and you close this

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.790 
hasn't been spliced and you close this
and<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.910> middle<00:03:42.180> thing<00:03:42.290> goes<00:03:43.290> through<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
and this middle thing goes through the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.340 
and this middle thing goes through the
insulation<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.180> wire<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.630> connects<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
insulation of the wire and connects the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.730 
insulation of the wire and connects the
two<00:03:46.530> wires<00:03:46.740> a<00:03:46.890> platform<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.780> then<00:03:48.780> that's

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
two wires a platform and then that's

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.700 
two wires a platform and then that's
what<00:03:49.980> allows<00:03:50.550> your<00:03:50.790> tachometer<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.660> read<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
what allows your tachometer to read the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.730 
what allows your tachometer to read the
RPMs<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.370> your<00:03:53.490> car

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.810 

and<00:03:59.740> then<00:04:01.890> you're<00:04:02.890> pretty<00:04:03.100> much<00:04:03.250> done<00:04:03.490> at<00:04:03.670> that

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
and then you're pretty much done at that

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.270 
and then you're pretty much done at that
for<00:04:04.120> it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
for it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.320 
for it
I'll<00:04:06.280> just<00:04:07.290> show<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.350> really<00:04:08.500> quick<00:04:09.330> that

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
I'll just show you really quick that

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:18.909 
I'll just show you really quick that
Mike<00:04:10.570> does<00:04:11.320> read

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:34.159 

I<00:04:23.259> know<00:04:24.259> said<00:04:24.499> about<00:04:24.680> 500

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.269 

now<00:04:35.169> it's<00:04:35.349> a<00:04:35.409> cold<00:04:35.619> start<00:04:37.830> was<00:04:38.830> already<00:04:39.069> taking

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:39.279 
now it's a cold start was already taking

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.329 
now it's a cold start was already taking
out<00:04:39.369> the<00:04:39.490> key<00:04:40.559> so<00:04:41.559> as<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:41.889> can<00:04:41.979> see<00:04:42.189> it's

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:42.339 
out the key so as you can see it's

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.659 
out the key so as you can see it's
installed<00:04:43.059> and<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.319> works<00:04:44.469> pretty<00:04:44.619> good<00:04:44.740> there

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
installed and it works pretty good there

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.969 
installed and it works pretty good there
about<00:04:45.879> 20<00:04:46.209> bucks<00:04:46.419> at<00:04:46.629> autozone<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.649> it's

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
about 20 bucks at autozone and it's

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.379 
about 20 bucks at autozone and it's
really<00:04:48.309> worth<00:04:48.459> it<00:04:48.639> to<00:04:48.669> have<00:04:48.819> it<00:04:48.939> on<00:04:49.029> your<00:04:49.179> car

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
really worth it to have it on your car

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.510 
really worth it to have it on your car
tester<00:04:49.899> shift<00:04:50.169> batter<00:04:50.379> it's<00:04:51.099> my<00:04:51.279> shift

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
tester shift batter it's my shift

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.579 
tester shift batter it's my shift
patterns<00:04:52.029> they<00:04:52.569> were<00:04:52.629> good<00:04:53.080> but<00:04:53.379> they<00:04:53.409> were

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:53.589 
patterns they were good but they were

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:57.540 
patterns they were good but they were
too<00:04:53.949> low<00:04:54.789> so<00:04:55.499> shifting<00:04:56.499> before<00:04:57.189> I<00:04:57.219> should<00:04:57.459> have

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
too low so shifting before I should have

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.239 
too low so shifting before I should have
shifted<00:04:57.729> in<00:04:57.999> first<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.449> second<00:04:58.779> gear<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.249> now

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:00.249 
shifted in first in second gear but now

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.960 
shifted in first in second gear but now
I<00:05:00.279> will<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.610> able<00:05:00.699> to<00:05:00.849> shift<00:05:01.029> on<00:05:01.209> time

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
I will be able to shift on time

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.490 
I will be able to shift on time
so<00:05:03.970> that's<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.300> for<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.509> tachometer<00:05:04.900> if<00:05:05.290> you

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
so that's it for the tachometer if you

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.379 
so that's it for the tachometer if you
have<00:05:05.620> any<00:05:05.770> questions<00:05:06.220> feel<00:05:06.759> free<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:07.030> ask<00:05:07.240> me

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
have any questions feel free to ask me

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.879 
have any questions feel free to ask me
but<00:05:07.660> then<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.900> had<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.080> lot<00:05:08.259> of<00:05:08.290> trouble<00:05:08.620> start

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
but then I had a lot of trouble start

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.280 
but then I had a lot of trouble start
