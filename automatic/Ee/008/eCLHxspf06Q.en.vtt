00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
regular view fisheye City this odd

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.640 
regular view fisheye City this odd
there<00:05:01.580> we<00:05:01.730> go<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:03.010> don't<00:05:04.010> know<00:05:04.070> if<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.220> can<00:05:04.280> focus

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
there we go I don't know if I can focus

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:15.130 
there we go I don't know if I can focus
further<00:05:06.650> away<00:05:07.540> there<00:05:08.540> we<00:05:08.630> go<00:05:11.200> focus<00:05:12.229> nope<00:05:14.140> just

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
further away there we go focus nope just

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.639 
further away there we go focus nope just
too<00:05:16.810> close

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:19.649 
too close

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:25.079 
too close
