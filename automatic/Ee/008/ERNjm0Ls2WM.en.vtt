00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 there were several cars in the Soviet Union 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.290
 named after the great Russian rivers 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.670
 very little was known as to 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.500
 its main producer was 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.780
 Serpukhov Automobile Plant 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.940
 he got from his older brother 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.090
 Volga plant body parts 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.609
 the unit in serpukhov was welding 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 and body painting car assembly 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.099
 except for the usual passenger cars 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.500
 cargo versions were first released 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.219
 used as in-plant 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.309
 of transport 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.309
 later they went on sale in front 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.140
 it is usually to and behind her small body 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.520
 with a bubble-like plastic roof 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.800
 double lockable 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.329
 the back door opens a doorway wide by 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.820
 wall to wall cargo bay 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.850
 small about meter by meter and by 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.370
 meter here you can put 300 kilograms 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 cargo for small shipments just right 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.000
 now look under the hood 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.280
 here the usual 750 cc 2-cylinder 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 33 horsepower motor 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 vapor I'm moving in one direction 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 so to remove vibrations in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.890
 very balance shaft design 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.400
 amazing foot fit seats 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.380
 abound but the ceiling 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 rather low no frills inside no all 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.360
 spartan plastic torpedo 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 familiar since the days of pennies and devices 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.500
 grilles ventilation steering wheel plump 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.870
 nice to touch it is time to start 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.110
 the test is not entirely honest I'm going without 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.180
 passenger and those same 300 kills court 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.340
 hard to come up with something more comfortable 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.190
 the car is dynamic enough not to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.800
 test your own complex 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.570
 inferiority the only thing that prevents 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.500
 motorcycle engine sound and faster 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.159
 so he louder 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.530
 there will be no sense in music 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.469
 today such a van would use 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.259
 demand in the city with its traffic jams it 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.420
 alternative no soviet times this 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.400
 niche was occupied by motor scooters 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.140
 but of course they are comparable to 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.210
 or comp level 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 It is indispensable when transporting small 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.050
 consignments 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.840
 short distance when efficiency 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.780
 and cheap delivery is more important to whom 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.640
 gasoline consumption of this baby from three seconds 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.610
 half to five liters per hundred 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.060
 kilometers but unfortunately a few years 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.450
 backwards 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.819
 release of the smallest domestic 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.819
 van stopped
