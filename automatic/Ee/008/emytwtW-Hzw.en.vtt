00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.009
Welcome back to Epic Hookah Style!

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.100
Today we prepared for you

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.080
Rainbow Dash cocktail.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.320
It's a colorful rainbow cocktail,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.400
and...

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.120
Halloween special

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.420
A.K.A. Scarecrow

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.120
And we must say...

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.160
this is a cocktail...

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.180
that you MUST definitely try.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.960
It's great when you don't have too much mint here...

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.180
because...

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.300
only a tiny bit boosts the flavour.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.780
It's really fresh...

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.860
tasty...

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.900
sweet and sour...

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.560
it's like an energy drink.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.940
But more sour.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.160
I must agree it's very sweet.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.480
I really like the fact...

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.040
same as on previous cocktails...

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.380
the flavor always changes.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.360
Wow...

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.820
this is...

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.900
liquorice, totally.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.680
For guys from Vodna Fajka page...

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.660
our cocktail lasts more than 50 minutes.

00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:25.148
Despite we focus mainly on the flavor...

00:04:26.574 --> 00:04:28.574
if you prepare the hookah correctly...

00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:30.034
there's enough smoke as well.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800
It's been 10 minutes, pass the hookah!

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:42.858
This cocktail is very sweet...

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.540
sour...

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.480
and really addictive.

00:04:47.314 --> 00:04:47.814
And...

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.720
will look great in any glass hookah.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.360
You can definitely try it yourself...

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.360
because it's made from accesible ingredients...

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.754
and tobaccos.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.280
We strongly recommend it.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.260
Thanks for watching.

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:06.534
We would be happy for a like or subscription.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.580
And see you again with another cocktail...

00:05:11.654 --> 00:05:13.654
approximately in a month.
