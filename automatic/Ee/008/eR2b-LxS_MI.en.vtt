00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.349
 i'm a maxi machine and these are my best friends 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.370

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:19.140

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 we donâ€™t have our favorite cubes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 cubes don't worry day now 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.940
 a big truck will come and bring us 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.950
 multi-colored cubes wow I love so much 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.120
 play multi-colored cubes 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.120
 will be very fun 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.789
 I'll be the first to choose my cube 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.500
 I choose a red cube 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.590
 I like a green cube 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.700
 and I chose a yellow cube friends 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 let's 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.800
 from these cubes we will construct a tower maxim 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.800
 that's a great idea 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.500
 guys our tower reminds me of something 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:50.280
 so same road traffic guys and you 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.010
 know why you need a traffic light 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 he regulates the movement of cars on the road 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.390
 I wonder how he does it 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.680
 guys when the car is red 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 stops 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.080
 when the color is yellow it means that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 another color will turn on soon and when 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.590
 lit green the car starts its 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.590
 motion 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.710
 yes how cool maxi you are so smart 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.640
 guys remember you can cross the road 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:41.820
 only green color and be sure 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.820

00:02:45.090 --> 00:03:00.260
