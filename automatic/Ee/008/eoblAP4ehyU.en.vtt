to<00:00:45.780> live<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.800> yet<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.489> biodiversity<00:00:47.969> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to live here and yet the biodiversity is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.750 
to live here and yet the biodiversity is
one<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> hot<00:00:49.500> spots<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> planet<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
one of the hot spots on the planet and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.970 
one of the hot spots on the planet and
certainly<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.539> hot<00:00:51.750> spot<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.440> terms<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.770> North

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
certainly the hot spot in terms of North

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
certainly the hot spot in terms of North
America<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> why<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.899> end<00:00:55.110> up

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
America and so this is why we end up

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.740 
America and so this is why we end up
with<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:55.649> conflicts<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> interest<00:00:57.120> people

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
with these conflicts of interest people

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
with these conflicts of interest people
want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> live<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.469> people<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.219> want

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
want to live here people you know want

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
want to live here people you know want
to<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.699> houses<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.629> yet<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.530> all

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to have houses here and yet we have all

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
to have houses here and yet we have all
this<00:01:01.890> diversity<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.629> are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this diversity and a lot of things are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.580 
this diversity and a lot of things are
very<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.880> habitat<00:01:05.880> specific<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> that's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
very very habitat specific and that's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
very very habitat specific and that's
the<00:01:07.740> trick<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> try<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.670> find<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> balance

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the trick is to try to find that balance

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.370 
the trick is to try to find that balance
of<00:01:09.869> course<00:01:11.180> one<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.479> things<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.020> know

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of course one of the things I know

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
of course one of the things I know
you're<00:01:13.770> saying<00:01:14.100> k<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.640> their<00:01:14.820> thought

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you're saying k how their thought

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.270 
you're saying k how their thought
talking<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.500> hauling<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.770> some<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
talking about hauling up some of the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
talking about hauling up some of the
non-natives<00:01:18.090> ornamentals<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:19.020> being

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
non-natives ornamentals that are being

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.830 
non-natives ornamentals that are being
irrigated<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.250> give<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.180> away<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.509> they

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
irrigated and and give them away so they

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.649 
irrigated and and give them away so they
don't<00:01:22.049> die<00:01:22.290> I'd<00:01:23.070> recommend<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:24.119> dumping

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
don't die I'd recommend just dumping

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.429 
don't die I'd recommend just dumping
them<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.700> reason<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.320> know

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
them and the reason is is that you know

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.319 
them and the reason is is that you know
we<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> better<00:01:30.329> job<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:32.329> where

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
we can we can do a better job of where

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.569 
we can we can do a better job of where
we<00:01:33.479> live<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> semi<00:01:34.320> urban<00:01:34.590> place<00:01:35.040> next<00:01:35.430> to
