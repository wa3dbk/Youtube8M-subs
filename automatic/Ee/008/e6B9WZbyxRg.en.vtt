on the only thing is see is the white
screen<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.550> manufacturer

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
screen this is because the manufacturer

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.790 
screen this is because the manufacturer
at<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.510> point<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.779> time<00:00:24.810> decided<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.560> use<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
at some point in time decided to use a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.519 
at some point in time decided to use a
different<00:00:26.130> LCD<00:00:26.789> supplier<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:28.199> firmware

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
different LCD supplier and the firmware

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.089 
different LCD supplier and the firmware
from<00:00:29.060> April<00:00:30.080> only<00:00:31.080> works<00:00:31.410> within<00:00:31.740> your

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
from April only works within your

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.150 
from April only works within your
devices<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> newer<00:00:33.390> LCD<00:00:34.350> screen

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
devices that have the newer LCD screen

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.780 
devices that have the newer LCD screen
and<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:36.630> firmware<00:00:37.350> versions<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.219> January

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and the firmware versions from January

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.170 
and the firmware versions from January
to<00:00:39.090> March<00:00:39.270> only<00:00:40.170> work<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> devices<00:00:41.180> that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
to March only work with the devices that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.380 
to March only work with the devices that
were<00:00:42.300> released<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.050> point<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:44.390> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
were released at that point in time so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.810 
were released at that point in time so
basically<00:00:45.539> don't<00:00:46.050> worry<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.590> device<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
basically don't worry your device is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
basically don't worry your device is
still<00:00:48.210> fully<00:00:48.510> functional<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
still fully functional it's just that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.350 
still fully functional it's just that
these<00:00:50.190> screen<00:00:50.730> doesn't<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
these screen doesn't have the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
these screen doesn't have the
appropriate<00:00:51.870> drivers<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.850> see

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
appropriate drivers but as you can see

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.040 
appropriate drivers but as you can see
if<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.270> press<00:00:54.480> ok

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
if I press ok

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the camera starts recording and when I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.920 
the camera starts recording and when I
plug<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> device<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> computer<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:03.690> will

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
plug the device to the computer it will

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.490 
plug the device to the computer it will
also<00:01:04.640> work<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.670> fine<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.170> need<00:01:07.350> to
