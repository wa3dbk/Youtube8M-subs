00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
have probably seen this team in the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.880 
have probably seen this team in the
tournament<00:00:31.539> tested<00:00:32.110> series<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:32.559> if<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.739> guys

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
tournament tested series so if you guys

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.830 
tournament tested series so if you guys
have<00:00:33.160> seen<00:00:33.190> this<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:34.059> is<00:00:34.210> actually<00:00:34.720> the

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
have seen this this is actually the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.660 
have seen this this is actually the
first<00:00:34.870> game<00:00:35.589> I<00:00:35.620> actually<00:00:35.949> played<00:00:36.309> with<00:00:36.519> them

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
first game I actually played with them

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.439 
first game I actually played with them
so<00:00:36.970> I<00:00:37.870> this<00:00:38.470> this<00:00:38.739> game<00:00:39.190> didn't<00:00:39.580> go<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:40.150> best

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
so I this this game didn't go the best

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.000 
so I this this game didn't go the best
it<00:00:40.720> possibly<00:00:40.750> could<00:00:41.320> I<00:00:41.379> did<00:00:41.620> have<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:41.890> get

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
it possibly could I did have to get

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.740 
it possibly could I did have to get
adjusted<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.549> the<00:00:42.850> positioning<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.479> all<00:00:43.629> the

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
adjusted to the positioning of all the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.930 
adjusted to the positioning of all the
players<00:00:43.960> so<00:00:44.199> anytime<00:00:44.589> I<00:00:44.620> use<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> new<00:00:45.220> formation

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
players so anytime I use a new formation

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.609 
players so anytime I use a new formation
it<00:00:46.239> does<00:00:46.390> take<00:00:46.600> me<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:46.809> game<00:00:47.110> or<00:00:47.260> two<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.530> get

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:47.619 
it does take me a game or two to get

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:50.039 
it does take me a game or two to get
adjusted<00:00:48.159> come<00:00:48.820> apart<00:00:49.119> as<00:00:49.239> our<00:00:49.420> next<00:00:49.839> opponent

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
adjusted come apart as our next opponent

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.469 
adjusted come apart as our next opponent
of<00:00:50.350> 442<00:00:50.769> has<00:00:51.220> a<00:00:51.250> really<00:00:51.580> poor<00:00:51.970> team<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.390> be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
of 442 has a really poor team to be

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:53.789 
of 442 has a really poor team to be
honest<00:00:52.720> with<00:00:52.839> you<00:00:52.930> guys<00:00:53.080> but<00:00:53.350> he<00:00:53.470> did<00:00:53.650> play

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
personally you guys know that pace is

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.320 
personally you guys know that pace is
not<00:01:06.100> really<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.369> big<00:01:06.580> part<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.880> my<00:01:06.970> game<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:07.210> know

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
not really a big part of my game I know

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.120 
not really a big part of my game I know
a<00:01:07.420> lot<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.689> people<00:01:07.810> feel<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.290> pace<00:01:08.680> is<00:01:08.890> very

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
a lot of people feel that pace is very

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.359 
a lot of people feel that pace is very
important<00:01:09.700> but<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:10.930> think<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.799> only<00:01:11.920> only

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
important but I think the only only

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.459 
important but I think the only only
place<00:01:12.820> where<00:01:13.060> pace<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.630> important<00:01:14.320> is

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
place where pace is important is

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.370 
place where pace is important is
probably<00:01:15.009> your<00:01:15.219> defenders<00:01:15.789> and<00:01:16.630> only<00:01:17.020> one<00:01:17.229> of

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
probably your defenders and only one of

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.499 
probably your defenders and only one of
your<00:01:17.500> defenders<00:01:17.979> by<00:01:18.100> as<00:01:18.280> far<00:01:18.939> as<00:01:19.030> centre-backs

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
your defenders by as far as centre-backs

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.819 
your defenders by as far as centre-backs
this<00:01:19.750> isn't<00:01:20.020> your<00:01:20.079> left<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.439> right<00:01:20.530> back<00:01:20.679> as

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
this isn't your left and right back as

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.139 
this isn't your left and right back as
far<00:01:20.950> as<00:01:21.009> centre-backs<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.640> think<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:22.000> only

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
far as centre-backs I think you only

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.240 
far as centre-backs I think you only
need<00:01:22.359> one<00:01:22.630> Pacey<00:01:22.929> center<00:01:23.320> back<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.710> then<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
need one Pacey center back and then the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.830 
need one Pacey center back and then the
other<00:01:24.399> one<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.670> like<00:01:24.789> to<00:01:25.090> usually<00:01:25.270> have<00:01:25.539> is<00:01:25.689> a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
other one I like to usually have is a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.200 
other one I like to usually have is a
strong<00:01:26.229> tall<00:01:26.679> good<00:01:27.219> defender<00:01:27.729> who<00:01:27.820> could<00:01:27.969> stay

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
strong tall good defender who could stay

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.599 
strong tall good defender who could stay
back<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.719> clean<00:01:28.899> everything<00:01:29.020> else<00:01:29.530> up<00:01:29.740> if<00:01:30.039> our

Pacey<00:01:30.850> defender<00:01:31.299> misses<00:01:31.630> anything<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:32.259> that's

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
Pacey defender misses anything so that's

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.679 
Pacey defender misses anything so that's
my<00:01:33.159> personal<00:01:33.490> take<00:01:33.729> on<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.179> know<00:01:34.210> usually

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
the most convincing of victory so I did

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.750 
the most convincing of victory so I did
feel<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> little<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:20.140> shaky<00:02:21.100> about<00:02:21.190> using<00:02:21.670> this

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
feel a little bit shaky about using this

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.100 
feel a little bit shaky about using this
for<00:02:22.060> for<00:02:22.300> 112

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
for for 112

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.110 
for for 112
I<00:02:23.140> felt<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.980> something<00:02:24.430> might<00:02:24.700> be<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.880> but

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
I felt like is something might be up but

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.790 
I felt like is something might be up but
it<00:02:25.240> was<00:02:25.510> my<00:02:25.780> first<00:02:25.990> game<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.470> them<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.770> I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
it was my first game with them so I

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.290 
it was my first game with them so I
continue<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> give<00:02:27.460> him<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> shot<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
continue to give him a shot and then the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.960 
continue to give him a shot and then the
4411<00:02:29.020> actually<00:02:29.590> started<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.430> become<00:02:30.580> one<00:02:30.940> of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
4411 actually started to become one of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.340 
4411 actually started to become one of
my<00:02:31.120> favorite<00:02:31.420> formations<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:32.050> if<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.260> guys

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
my favorite formations now if you guys

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.780 
my favorite formations now if you guys
don't<00:02:32.620> know<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.800> lot<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.040> people<00:02:33.130> last<00:02:33.580> year

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
don't know a lot of people last year

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.450 
don't know a lot of people last year
would<00:02:34.510> make<00:02:34.720> for<00:02:35.050> 4<00:02:35.350> 11<00:02:35.830> teams<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.370> then

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
would make for 4 11 teams and then

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.000 
would make for 4 11 teams and then
switch<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:37.030> 4<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.480> 3<00:02:37.510> 1<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.080> game<00:02:38.380> personally

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
switch to a 4 to 3 1 in game personally

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.590 
switch to a 4 to 3 1 in game personally
because<00:02:39.190> or<00:02:39.760> not<00:02:39.910> personally<00:02:40.240> because<00:02:40.330> but

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
because or not personally because but

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.080 
because or not personally because but
usually<00:02:40.960> because<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:42.220> left<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.700> right<00:02:42.730> mid

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
usually because the left and right mid

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.760 
usually because the left and right mid
would<00:02:43.270> play<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:43.600> their<00:02:43.750> cams<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.500> year

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
would play as their cams and this year

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.410 
would play as their cams and this year
you<00:02:44.800> can't<00:02:45.130> even<00:02:45.250> use<00:02:45.520> left<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.970> right<00:02:46.180> meds

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
you can't even use left the right meds

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.450 
you can't even use left the right meds
as<00:02:46.630> cams<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.290> think<00:02:47.470> they<00:02:47.590> get<00:02:47.710> 5<00:02:47.980> chem<00:02:48.310> they

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
as cams I think they get 5 chem they

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.250 
as cams I think they get 5 chem they
don't<00:02:48.640> get<00:02:48.730> 7<00:02:49.120> chem<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.480> they<00:02:49.600> did<00:02:49.780> last<00:02:49.810> year

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
don't get 7 chem like they did last year

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.820 
don't get 7 chem like they did last year
so<00:02:50.730> that's<00:02:51.730> what<00:02:51.940> mainly<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.450> 4411<00:02:53.110> was<00:02:53.440> used

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
so that's what mainly the 4411 was used

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.290 
so that's what mainly the 4411 was used
for<00:02:53.980> last<00:02:54.250> year<00:02:54.490> they<00:02:54.610> would<00:02:54.760> just<00:02:54.790> make<00:02:55.270> a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
for last year they would just make a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.690 
for last year they would just make a
4411<00:02:55.990> team<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:56.530> switch<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.950> 4<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.340> 3<00:02:57.370> 1

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
4411 team and then switch to a 4 to 3 1

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.910 
4411 team and then switch to a 4 to 3 1
in<00:02:57.820> game<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.660> year<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:59.050> feels<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.350> lot<00:02:59.590> better

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
in game this year it feels a lot better

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.590 
in game this year it feels a lot better
it<00:03:00.190> just<00:03:00.220> feels<00:03:00.610> like<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.760> really<00:03:01.090> balanced

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
it just feels like a really balanced

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.970 
it just feels like a really balanced
formation<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.350> have<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:02.739> good
