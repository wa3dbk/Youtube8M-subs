00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.799 
1000 thought it would be good enough to
go<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> Alaska<00:00:41.329> rough<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> mountains

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
stand I got the extra wider foot so that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
stand I got the extra wider foot so that
way<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.560> wouldn't<00:01:49.890> sink<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> ground<00:01:51.210> as

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
way it wouldn't sink into the ground as

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
way it wouldn't sink into the ground as
many<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.720> bikes<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.740> sings<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.130> bike

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
many of my bikes at and sings this bike

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.060 
many of my bikes at and sings this bike
is<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.610> much<00:01:53.759> bigger<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.390> thought<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.530> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
is so much bigger I thought that it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.420 
is so much bigger I thought that it
would<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.310> worth<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.920> again<00:01:58.920> coming<00:01:59.130> from<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
would be worth it so again coming from a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.240 
would be worth it so again coming from a
street<00:01:59.640> bike<00:02:00.259> not<00:02:01.259> never<00:02:01.619> ridden<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.950> dirt<00:02:02.100> bike

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
street bike not never ridden a dirt bike

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.249 
street bike not never ridden a dirt bike
in<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.579> life<00:02:02.729> I've<00:02:03.390> tried<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.049> didn't

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
in my life I've tried it and I didn't

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:04.940 
in my life I've tried it and I didn't
like<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
like it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.950 
like it
so<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.759> lot<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.000> people<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.329> say<00:02:06.450> what

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
so then a lot of people would say what

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
so then a lot of people would say what
am<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.110> doing<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.429> wanted

I<00:02:48.549> could<00:02:48.580> we<00:02:49.390> could<00:02:49.540> go<00:02:49.690> over<00:02:49.720> 10<00:02:50.230> inch<00:02:50.380> logs<00:02:50.650> we

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
I could we could go over 10 inch logs we

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.199 
I could we could go over 10 inch logs we
could<00:02:51.250> go<00:02:51.340> through<00:02:51.489> snow<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:51.940> could<00:02:52.090> go

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
could go through snow we could go

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.830 
could go through snow we could go
through

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840

a bike that was so bottom and torquey
and<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.700> was<00:03:15.849> really<00:03:16.180> hard<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.780> still<00:03:17.019> is

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
and it was really hard and the still is

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.720 
and it was really hard and the still is
hard<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.590> control<00:03:17.950> for<00:03:18.130> me<00:03:18.250> I've<00:03:18.340> done<00:03:18.370> a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
hard to control for me I've done a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.699 
hard to control for me I've done a
thousand<00:03:19.570> kilometers<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.019> did<00:03:20.260> 11<00:03:20.440> hours

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
thousand kilometers I did 11 hours

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.009 
thousand kilometers I did 11 hours
yesterday<00:03:20.920> 600<00:03:21.910> kilometers<00:03:22.329> in<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
yesterday 600 kilometers in the

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.660 
yesterday 600 kilometers in the
mountains<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:24.040> thought<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.430> would<00:03:24.549> be

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
mountains and I thought it would be

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.340 
mountains and I thought it would be
getting<00:03:24.880> easier<00:03:25.299> but<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.600> fact<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.959> actually

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
getting easier but in fact it actually

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.349 
getting easier but in fact it actually
wore<00:03:26.920> my<00:03:27.070> wrist<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.489> trying<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.850> control<00:03:28.180> this

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
wore my wrist up trying to control this

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:28.970 
wore my wrist up trying to control this
thing

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
thing

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.680 
thing
I'm<00:03:29.980> sure<00:03:30.160> KTM<00:03:30.579> guys<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:31.060> watch<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.540> are

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
I'm sure KTM guys that watch this are

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.990 
I'm sure KTM guys that watch this are
gonna<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:32.049> mad<00:03:32.380> for<00:03:32.440> me<00:03:32.829> saying<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:33.459> it's

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000

gonna be mad for me saying that but it's
a<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:34.269> hard<00:03:34.480> bike<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.870> control<00:03:35.519> I'm

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
a really hard bike to control I'm

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.699 
a really hard bike to control I'm
definitely<00:03:37.000> not<00:03:37.120> like<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.329> street<00:03:37.540> bike<00:03:37.780> so

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
definitely not like a street bike so

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.199 
definitely not like a street bike so
here<00:03:38.890> are<00:03:38.950> some<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.220> issues<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> very

that's something new to get used to this
position<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.030> bars<00:03:58.269> you'll<00:03:59.230> probably

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
position of the bars you'll probably

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.720 
position of the bars you'll probably
have<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.739> adjust<00:03:59.980> them<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.190> your<00:04:00.340> own<00:04:00.519> liking

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
have to adjust them to your own liking

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.720 
have to adjust them to your own liking
because<00:04:01.269> you<00:04:02.109> know<00:04:02.340> everyone's<00:04:03.340> different

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
because you know everyone's different

the<00:04:04.540> way<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.780> throttle<00:04:05.109> operates<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.769> do

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
the way the throttle operates I do

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.580 
the way the throttle operates I do
suggest<00:04:06.400> getting<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:07.030> cam<00:04:07.780> setup<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:08.350> that<00:04:08.380> way

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
suggest getting a cam setup so that way

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.620 
suggest getting a cam setup so that way
you<00:04:08.650> can<00:04:08.920> adjust<00:04:09.190> how<00:04:09.579> it<00:04:09.790> operates<00:04:10.480> you

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
you can adjust how it operates you

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.240 
you can adjust how it operates you
change<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.049> cam<00:04:11.260> in<00:04:11.500> there<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.799> it's<00:04:11.920> it's

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
change the cam in there and it's it's

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.199 
change the cam in there and it's it's

know I was on a BMW in the windshield
wasn't<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.270> great<00:05:04.420> either<00:05:04.480> but<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.560> know<00:05:05.590> if

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
wasn't that great either but you know if

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.470 
wasn't that great either but you know if
you're<00:05:05.920> coming<00:05:06.190> from<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.550> street<00:05:06.790> bike<00:05:07.000> we're

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
you're coming from a street bike we're

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.090 
you're coming from a street bike we're
beautiful<00:05:07.690> fairing<00:05:08.320> on<00:05:08.440> there<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.710> yet<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:08.890> big

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
beautiful fairing on there and yet a big

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.250 
beautiful fairing on there and yet a big
windshield<00:05:09.490> you're<00:05:10.330> you're<00:05:10.720> just<00:05:10.960> gonna<00:05:11.080> have

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
windshield you're you're just gonna have

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.110 
windshield you're you're just gonna have
to<00:05:11.350> be<00:05:11.680> get<00:05:11.950> used<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.340> feeling<00:05:12.670> the<00:05:12.910> wind

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
to be get used to feeling the wind

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.730 
to be get used to feeling the wind
because<00:05:13.570> if<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.990> didn't<00:05:14.290> feel<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:14.440> wind

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
because if you didn't feel the wind

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.440 
because if you didn't feel the wind
you're<00:05:14.920> gonna<00:05:15.010> be<00:05:15.190> losing<00:05:15.550> on<00:05:15.670> visibility<00:05:15.970> and

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
you're gonna be losing on visibility and

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.540 
you're gonna be losing on visibility and
and<00:05:17.290> that's<00:05:17.500> where<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:17.710> think<00:05:17.770> KTM<00:05:18.280> did<00:05:18.430> it

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
and that's where I think KTM did it

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.730 
and that's where I think KTM did it
right<00:05:18.700> I'm<00:05:19.480> gonna<00:05:19.630> get<00:05:19.870> an<00:05:19.960> extra<00:05:20.260> piece<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.620> go

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
right I'm gonna get an extra piece to go

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.540 
right I'm gonna get an extra piece to go
on<00:05:20.830> top<00:05:21.010> of<00:05:21.070> here

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
on top of here

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.910 
on top of here
so<00:05:21.790> that<00:05:21.910> way<00:05:22.060> can<00:05:22.470> deflect<00:05:23.470> it<00:05:23.650> up<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.830> little

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
so that way can deflect it up a little

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.070 
so that way can deflect it up a little
bit<00:05:24.070> over<00:05:24.190> my<00:05:24.310> head

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
bit over my head

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.270 
bit over my head
here's<00:05:26.080> another<00:05:26.200> problem<00:05:26.470> with<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.770> KTM<00:05:27.160> that

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
here's another problem with the KTM that

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.980 
here's another problem with the KTM that
I'm<00:05:27.340> finding<00:05:27.640> out<00:05:27.700> now<00:05:28.320> this<00:05:29.320> mirror<00:05:29.800> here

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
I'm finding out now this mirror here

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.080 
I'm finding out now this mirror here
connects<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.080> your<00:05:32.490> master<00:05:33.490> cylinder<00:05:33.880> for

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
connects to your master cylinder for

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.650 
connects to your master cylinder for
your<00:05:34.630> clutch<00:05:34.840> you<00:05:35.740> dump<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.160> bike<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:37.330> you

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
your clutch you dump the bike and you

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.500 
your clutch you dump the bike and you
hit<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:37.840> here<00:05:38.250> you'll<00:05:39.250> break<00:05:39.460> it<00:05:39.520> here<00:05:40.000> and

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
hit it here you'll break it here and

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.640 
hit it here you'll break it here and
then<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.660> won't<00:05:40.900> have<00:05:40.990> an<00:05:41.110> ability<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.560> get

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
then you won't have an ability to get

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.680 
then you won't have an ability to get
home<00:05:41.860> so<00:05:42.430> I'm<00:05:42.520> gonna<00:05:42.610> get<00:05:42.790> the<00:05:42.880> relocation<00:05:43.510> kit

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
home so I'm gonna get the relocation kit

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.680 
home so I'm gonna get the relocation kit
that<00:05:44.470> will<00:05:44.620> be<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:45.670> just<00:05:45.940> moves<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.360> over<00:05:46.600> to

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
that will be it just moves it over to

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.390 
that will be it just moves it over to
the<00:05:46.810> side<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:47.410> that<00:05:47.440> way<00:05:47.710> it's<00:05:48.010> not<00:05:48.160> going<00:05:48.340> to

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
the side so that way it's not going to

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.460 
the side so that way it's not going to
take<00:05:48.580> that<00:05:48.610> out<00:05:48.940> ix<00:05:49.570> finding<00:05:49.960> out<00:05:50.110> from<00:05:50.260> other

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
take that out ix finding out from other

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.620 
take that out ix finding out from other
bike<00:05:50.740> riders<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.850> center<00:05:52.150> stand<00:05:52.360> where<00:05:52.570> the

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
bike riders the center stand where the

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.390 
bike riders the center stand where the
side<00:05:52.810> stand<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.290> connected<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.070> engine

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
side stand is connected to the engine

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.630 
side stand is connected to the engine
and<00:05:54.610> if<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.270> hit<00:05:55.630> this<00:05:55.840> hard<00:05:56.230> enough<00:05:56.610> you<00:05:57.610> can

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
and if you hit this hard enough you can

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.760 
and if you hit this hard enough you can
crack<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.240> engine<00:05:58.510> open<00:05:58.780> so<00:05:59.530> there's<00:05:59.710> a

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
crack the engine open so there's a

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.040 
crack the engine open so there's a
relocator<00:06:00.220> kit<00:06:00.490> for<00:06:00.670> that<00:06:00.790> I'm<00:06:01.390> not<00:06:01.660> too<00:06:01.870> sure

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
relocator kit for that I'm not too sure

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.300 
relocator kit for that I'm not too sure
if<00:06:02.080> I'm<00:06:02.260> gonna<00:06:02.350> go<00:06:02.530> that<00:06:02.680> far<00:06:02.860> but<00:06:03.070> there

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
if I'm gonna go that far but there

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
if I'm gonna go that far but there
definitely<00:06:03.430> is<00:06:03.850> a<00:06:04.090> kit<00:06:04.870> for<00:06:05.050> that<00:06:05.080> to<00:06:05.350> fix<00:06:05.560> that

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
definitely is a kit for that to fix that

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.670 
definitely is a kit for that to fix that
the<00:06:07.330> rims<00:06:08.880> beautiful<00:06:09.880> rims<00:06:10.090> I<00:06:10.500> thought<00:06:11.500> they

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
the rims beautiful rims I thought they

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.070 
the rims beautiful rims I thought they
were<00:06:11.740> great<00:06:11.980> then<00:06:12.430> I<00:06:12.520> find<00:06:12.790> out<00:06:13.080> firsthand

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
were great then I find out firsthand

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.500 
were great then I find out firsthand
experience<00:06:14.760> to<00:06:15.760> other<00:06:15.910> people<00:06:16.210> that<00:06:16.270> we<00:06:16.420> were

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
experience to other people that we were

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.060 
experience to other people that we were
writing<00:06:16.810> with<00:06:17.070> blue<00:06:18.070> out<00:06:18.510> they<00:06:19.510> hit<00:06:20.070> some

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
writing with blue out they hit some

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.250 
writing with blue out they hit some
rocks<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.610> they<00:06:21.700> completely<00:06:22.360> pound<00:06:22.960> it<00:06:23.140> in

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
rocks and they completely pound it in

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.090 
rocks and they completely pound it in
this<00:06:23.440> rim<00:06:23.850> so<00:06:24.850> that's<00:06:25.030> three<00:06:25.870> bikes<00:06:26.200> in<00:06:26.500> one

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
this rim so that's three bikes in one

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.770 
this rim so that's three bikes in one
week<00:06:27.280> that<00:06:27.310> I've<00:06:27.550> seen<00:06:27.790> where<00:06:28.120> all<00:06:28.330> three<00:06:28.690> of

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
week that I've seen where all three of

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.050 
week that I've seen where all three of
them<00:06:28.930> needed<00:06:29.500> new<00:06:29.800> rims<00:06:30.040> and<00:06:30.400> apparently<00:06:30.910> it's

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
them needed new rims and apparently it's

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.930 
them needed new rims and apparently it's
a<00:06:31.120> common<00:06:31.510> flaw<00:06:31.780> they're<00:06:32.530> very<00:06:32.830> weak<00:06:33.070> rims<00:06:33.370> you

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
a common flaw they're very weak rims you

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.540 
a common flaw they're very weak rims you
don't<00:06:34.480> really<00:06:34.660> have<00:06:34.780> an<00:06:34.900> option<00:06:35.310> unless<00:06:36.310> you

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
don't really have an option unless you

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.130 
don't really have an option unless you
go<00:06:36.670> to<00:06:36.730> a<00:06:36.790> really<00:06:37.000> high<00:06:37.270> and<00:06:37.450> aftermarket<00:06:37.810> rim

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
go to a really high and aftermarket rim

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.590 
go to a really high and aftermarket rim
then<00:06:38.950> you're<00:06:39.520> talking<00:06:39.880> a<00:06:39.910> couple<00:06:40.180> thousand

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
then you're talking a couple thousand

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.950 
then you're talking a couple thousand
dollars<00:06:40.930> so<00:06:41.640> get<00:06:42.640> tires<00:06:42.910> really<00:06:43.540> good<00:06:43.750> side

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
dollars so get tires really good side

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.020 
dollars so get tires really good side
walls<00:06:44.170> like<00:06:44.380> these<00:06:44.530> ones<00:06:44.800> keep<00:06:45.670> the<00:06:45.820> tire

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
walls like these ones keep the tire

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.120 
walls like these ones keep the tire
pressure<00:06:46.300> off<00:06:46.540> never<00:06:46.810> let<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.110> out<00:06:47.200> and<00:06:47.500> don't

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
pressure off never let it out and don't

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.530 
pressure off never let it out and don't
hit<00:06:48.250> stuff<00:06:48.490> too<00:06:48.670> hard<00:06:48.880> in<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.180> rim<00:06:49.330> should

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
hit stuff too hard in the rim should

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.690 
hit stuff too hard in the rim should
last<00:06:49.720> you<00:06:49.960> now<00:06:50.710> remember<00:06:51.070> these<00:06:51.160> are<00:06:51.220> two<00:06:51.460> type

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.010 
then we can even get into the fact that

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.950 
then we can even get into the fact that
doing<00:07:54.760> an<00:07:54.940> oil<00:07:55.030> change<00:07:55.150> on<00:07:55.450> this<00:07:55.600> isn't<00:07:55.900> a

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 
doing an oil change on this isn't a

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.410 
doing an oil change on this isn't a
drain<00:07:56.140> plug<00:07:56.260> and<00:07:56.380> a<00:07:56.500> spin<00:07:56.710> on<00:07:56.770> filter<00:07:57.160> it's<00:07:57.820> can

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:58.420 
drain plug and a spin on filter it's can

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.300 
drain plug and a spin on filter it's can
be<00:07:58.510> a<00:07:58.540> four<00:07:58.780> hour<00:07:58.930> job<00:07:59.290> it<00:07:59.560> can<00:07:59.680> be<00:07:59.800> an<00:07:59.890> hour<00:08:00.040> job

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310 
be a four hour job it can be an hour job

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.590 
be a four hour job it can be an hour job
just<00:08:00.550> depends<00:08:00.850> on<00:08:00.940> how<00:08:01.060> good<00:08:01.090> you<00:08:01.330> are<00:08:01.390> and

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.510 
it's expensive okay I look forward to

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.470
