00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 I just want to take none 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 question that is not disappointed 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.630
 obviously they put him in this as 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.880
 we have said the taste so that it 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:22.350
 ask how are we going to take a glass 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 of a small fermentation of a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.730
 portion of a minimum minimum portion what 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 that we can show what is there 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.439
 in the colander that little bit that is there 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 it is generally what is given away 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 It's like a teaspoon of coffee and if it's 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 that of course but in strict rigor that does not 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.719
 is a good parameter now if you 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.950
 is going to make it cool 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.020
 can you take out 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.530
 it may be that below there is a large 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.910
 amount of good those that are given are 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.860
 those who are racing go to game 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.989
 for lack of wonder and those who are 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.300
 floating those that are the ones that are already 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.949
 very large mature ones just come out 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.539
 then generally to grana only 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.550
 get a spoon to make a 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.020
 We are good here, asking us 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.390
 owners ourselves if we can give away 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.630
 between us none metallic but 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.810
 accurate non-metallic eye water 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.469
 it has to be at least at least 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.880
 the day 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.750
 you know you have direct all 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.490
 the evils 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.799
 in fact if you want to feed it 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.469
 with sugar can be how they are kept 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.539
 because they grow because one daily or by 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.630
 at least every other day he throws a 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.479
 teaspoon of sugar blonde sugar so 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.670
 white does not kill them, chancaca the baked 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.319
 is generally responsible for what is 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.939
 said and this for the color that I can 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.000
 say they are fed that 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.289
 I recommend I throw you not grated because 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 so you can be confused in 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.580
 other apple landmarks loves the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.130
 apple although yes other people 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.899
 that they have already cultivated for 6 years 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.090
 that the chancaca you can use the best 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.860
 because somehow the fungus you 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.659
 is teaching 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.369
 here you have to attack in you in your 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.090
 body and never conventional 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.259
 wait let's go step by step let's go with the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.259
 first you were yourself 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:12.989
 every morning I have a small bottle 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.879
 then that would be to give if we go 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.319
 to do a crop from scratch thanks to 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.549
 what for exactly what kind of water 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.489
 nothing of anybody a wooden spoon 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.530
 Perfect fine metal mayra 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.140
 I can and together in a glass here 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.019
 A very small candie's girl portion 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.659
 and this already gave it away and here we have the 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.430
 perfect cooked water then excellent 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.920
 What is this that I have here? 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.980
 today I am going to throw them in water 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.239
 clearly cooks and hopefully but positive 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.030
 my question is cooked and cold 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.680
 it's not even cold the best low where 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.480
 this is kept in a dark place 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.450
 cool people leave it in the bathroom 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.489
 really but without water I have done the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
 chanca with the fruit made the chakana 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.489
 obviously and everything to see how they 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.170
 they talked commented that's why at 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.420
 principle to the equation is very dense 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.459
 like dirty water dirty water they 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.450
 begin to make it cleaner because it 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.159
 they start to eat the sugar of enemies 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.889
 exactly but the best 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.299
 in other apple sites that has 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.949
 natural because just as tight as 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.819
 maybe I'm getting him maybe an excess 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.010
 of sugar 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.870
 has the water and here one puts you in the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.060
 chanca quito and here is very important you 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.290
 you put on gauze because the truth is that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.329
 I was but it has to be something that 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.569
 allows porous arm to breathe in 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.569
 they 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.340
 to remove them like a hat 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.840
 cupcake never place the same stage 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.400
 of that bottle that can be metallic 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.439
 because yes that hermetically closed 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.299
 As they are mushroom they start can reach 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.430
 explode because a precious fermentation 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.019
 of course and clearly this is not how 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.879
 he feels in his full comfort plan 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.859
 they need to grow expand and 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.769
 create different colonies understand that 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.200
 a microorganism is a very creature 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.840
 simple in its composition but that has 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.969
 decided to perfect itself more 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.060
 not evolve does not change shape is not 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:02.099
 like a dinosaur that ended up committed 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.480
 a bird for example as some theory 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.609
 of evolution indicates a setting 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.639
 Exactly this ends up adapting 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.829
 simply creating better and more 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.169
 complex self-defense systems to 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.269
 point that when you enter it you can 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.269
 somehow allow yourself those same 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.950
 gifts that he has made for 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.350
 enter it in your body 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.670
 it's something here one day has passed this 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.190
 color we throw the chanca with the 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.960
 chopped apple and has taken this color 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 as he had consumed consumption 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.400
 the following way you with what you 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.790
 Give your hand I have my little cup clean 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.190
 there is my water but there is everything like 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.460
 we are going to give away we do not care about this 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.510
 last because we're going to ingest say 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.590
 which is what are the ones that are 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.200
 floating and what is the step 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.540
 just like me my recommendation is 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.490
 this much at least is what 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.630
 I have done well to my people and the mineral 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.630
 fill less than half 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.820
 perfect then the mushrooms that 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.340
 they were here in the colander simply 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.770
 I would not give them to those who were 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.170
 floating obviously they saved them model 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.810
 and what I have here is a portion of 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.980
 half a glass some say as a friend that 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.500
 It tastes like chicha a little more 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.450
 Fermented the rich have the case I 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.890
 hidden second presses like like a 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.050
 fruit juice as call as 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.770
 exile especially and you this in 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.660
 fast fasting volume once fasting 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.670
 and it will leave you at least pain before 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.910
 that you take breakfast you take it 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.660
 with the ideal fasting and the last thing 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.660
 take when going to bed 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.110
 is
