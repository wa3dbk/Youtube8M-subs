00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.560
 Good morning 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 Asano has just been raised 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.919
 Yeah nowadays i am 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.949
 Clown backhand 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:12.689
 Attention 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.139
 We look at reinforcement or backhand of any player 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.539
 High is because now work 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.659
 Teaching materials 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:21.999
 Miss co-host 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.539
 Eh top player perfect copy mania even in vol.5 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.640
 Take back both hands backhand 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.529
 I am planning 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.889
 Hair Masamune also works hard in the countryside 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.620
 I do not write the public expenses on the government bond issue date 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.620
 I always drink and do cups like this 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.530
 I was using something I got a giveaway somewhere 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.590
 It is a coffee cup but I use it with care 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.760
 Feed 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.430
 cg 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 In 3 cases 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.080
 s Analysis of bankruptcy of a player is cg as a good impression 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.290
 As a picture 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 It has come to the place where it can be reproduced 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.500
 It is usually to see 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 Questionnaire from a lawsuit 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 Originator 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.560
 It is the second from the bottom of the shin 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.530
 You can check the form from different angles 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.530
 It is possible 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.990
 Shiraho Tono 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.170
 Most likely 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.150
 With a bucket 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.250
 As angry and angry 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.870
 Are you polymer 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.900
 And this is 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 How does it move in one side 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 Can be confirmed by the picture 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.920
 About this side already 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.750
 Spring volume between full copy 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.010
 It is a form that has become here 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.980
 I think that is 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.360
 That teaching material 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 It is kept 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.439
 It is Japan that it is made by this tool 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.439
 I think you understood from 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.319
 Furthermore 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.149
 It is players 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:15.769
 The warriors who are 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.989
 We are 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.989
 I want to extend the body part 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
 How verdi goes up 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.089
 So how is it rotating? 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.369
 In this clav 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.459
 Oh show 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.879
 It is a scarf 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.879
 In the eighth round 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.199
 Body 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.519
 If you pay tax 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.809
 Suddenly 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.259
 From the first half 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.519
 Elbow 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.519
 You're in the field 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.459
 In time 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.459
 The graph that can be confirmed is like this 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.709
 This is 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.709
 I follow my way 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.399
 It is anpanman with a bug 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.269
 I go and use it 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.090
 Yeah 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.129
 You are a completely fixed mania 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.129
 Now in such a progress situation 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.239
 Two people last week 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.319
 The analysis is almost over 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.169
 I am thinking that Davidonco players are taking 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.329
 One more player 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.089
 I'm thinking of going to the festival 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.899
 Each one is open stance 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.899
 In neutral stance 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.090
 Analysis of agreement backhand will be added and detailed 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.439
 is 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.439
 It is progress situation again 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.849
 It was over 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.269
 I want to introduce in blogs etc. 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.299
 It becomes eco-line today 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.010
 Well then
