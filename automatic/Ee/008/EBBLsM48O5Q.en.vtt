00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
such a crazy shape like this but I get

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
such a crazy shape like this but I get
it<00:00:21.869> now<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.920> shape<00:00:23.100> originates<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.880> course

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
it now it the shape originates of course

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.320 
it now it the shape originates of course
from<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.710> classic<00:00:25.710> skateboard<00:00:26.189> decks<00:00:26.430> or<00:00:26.609> decks

hammerhead in comparison to some of the
other<00:01:04.159> realm<00:01:05.159> boards<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.450> rocker

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
other realm boards is that that rocker

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.710 
other realm boards is that that rocker
zome<00:01:07.530> seems<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.100> nice<00:01:08.340> nice<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.270> flat<00:01:09.659> a

board is a a playful jack flex rating I
pretty<00:01:27.509> much<00:01:27.630> gave<00:01:27.840> me<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> bottom<00:01:28.350> three<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
pretty much gave me the bottom three the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
pretty much gave me the bottom three the
stance<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.549> centered<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> course<00:01:30.479> there's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
stance is centered of course there's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
stance is centered of course there's
quick<00:01:31.350> rip<00:01:31.560> edges<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.159> yes<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:33.210> edges<00:01:33.570> are

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
quick rip edges and yes these edges are

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.710 
quick rip edges and yes these edges are
fully<00:01:34.500> wrapped<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.400> around<00:01:35.720> another

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
fully wrapped all the way around another

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
fully wrapped all the way around another
thing<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.650> edges<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
thing that the edges have that some of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
thing that the edges have that some of
the<00:01:38.939> other<00:01:39.090> boards<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.110> Rome<00:01:40.350> line<00:01:40.619> don't

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the other boards in the Rome line don't

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.670 
the other boards in the Rome line don't
have<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.240> butter<00:01:42.479> out<00:01:42.570> transition<00:01:43.320> zones

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
have or the butter out transition zones

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.399 
have or the butter out transition zones
which<00:01:44.250> means<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.299> contact<00:01:45.840> points<00:01:46.259> have

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
which means the contact points have

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
which means the contact points have
actually<00:01:46.770> been<00:01:46.890> lengthened<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.820> little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.180> so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
actually been lengthened a little bit so

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.410 
actually been lengthened a little bit so
you're<00:01:48.720> less<00:01:48.960> likely<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.380> catch<00:01:50.030> your<00:01:51.030> contact
