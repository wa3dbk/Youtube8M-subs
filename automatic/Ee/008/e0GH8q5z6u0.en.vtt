00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.069
 have you heard anything about the theater 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.690
 the old game for now is unlikely many 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.679
 generally say that such a game is not 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.450
 there is such a theater 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 computer game since the first thought 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.189
 our days if you find it only on 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.560
 old scratched in pirated discs 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.050
 with the game itself most likely on disk 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 there will be a cover of a licensed copy of the game 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.380
 almost empty 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.349
 except for the image so 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.540
 called the ticket collector and the ticket collectors are 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.180
 merely unconvincingly drawn 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.969
 bald man of european appearance with 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.100
 big red lips 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.879
 wearing a red jacket white shirt 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.219
 black pants usher looks devoid of 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.860
 all sorts of emotions though some argue 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.690
 what if you break a game disk then 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.789
 looking next time on the cover you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.410
 see him expressing nothing before 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.809
 face contorted with anger this of course 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.680
 only urban legend forget about 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 this 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.620
 what is really interesting is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.050
 absence on the cover of any 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.510
 information developers as well as 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.180
 description of the game only ticket on white 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 background on both sides was originally a game 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 initially the game became known because of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 impossible to correctly install 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.729
 computer freezes at that moment when in 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.960
 installation process reaches the user 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.490
 before license agreement 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.100
 it is also noteworthy that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.140
 license agreement to the theater in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.360
 places where it is supposed to call the studio 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.550
 developer just left empty 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.410
 place most of those who are by 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.840
 own statement owned and 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.850
 license disc say that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.869
 problem freezes solved simple 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.240
 restart 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 then in case the disk is still 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.619
 is in the drive to the user 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.590
 invited to click on the button I agree 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.890
 when starting the system after pressing the button 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.110
 the installation continues the game begins 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 without any speeches except 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.930
 the main menu which represents 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.500
 sprite theater building on empty street 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.229
 gradually from the darkness appears 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.740
 name followed by three buttons 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.170
 menu 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.240
 new game loading and settings 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.390
 when you click on the settings button game 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.400
 instantly crashes to desktop 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.920
 loading as they say just does not work 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.780
 even with a save file 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.700
 pressing the download button is nowhere 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.260
 leads 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 thus the only working 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.330
 button is a new ga when you click on it 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.390
 the game begins with a first-person view 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.310
 you are standing in the empty lobby of the theater 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.200
 empty except for the ticket collector 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.569
 facing the dark corridors 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.239
 which as you might suggest leads to 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.370
 except for the theater itself 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.950
 no matter drawn movie posters either 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.170
 that as soon as a player approaches 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.660
 the ticker plays an audio recording 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.340
 terrible quality which says 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.340
 thank you enjoy watching 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.200
 at the bottom of the screen appears 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.020
 duplicate these words to the process of your 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.340
 moving along the corridor the screen goes dark 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.030
 some point becoming absolutely 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.340
 black 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.230
 after which you appear again in the same 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.070
 lobbies and repeat the same 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.070
 action again and again 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.800
 the game may seem meaningless and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.570
 unimaginably boring however if 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.380
 keep playing but happen 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.480
 few interesting things how many times 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.250
 need to go to and proudly appearance 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.830
 strange events at the moment 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.360
 unknown majority played 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.090
 claim that the number required 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.910
 repetitions randomly and of interest 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.270
 phenomena can occur both on 1 and 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.150
 on 400 attempts the phenomena themselves cause 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.890
 the players are very worried first 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.750
 what happens at some point 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.500
 having appeared once again in the lobby 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.120
 the player notices that the ticket collector has disappeared. 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.270
 being deprived of any choice 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.950
 continue on the dark corridor 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.510
 the above mentioned audio text below 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.970
 screen continue to appear and in 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.280
 the absence of the ticket collector 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.440
 however, with the advancement of the player, even 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.510
 when completely black screen are heard 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.300
 the sound of footsteps if the player 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.130
 keeps pushing the button people who 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.000
 by their own say played 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.609
 original game 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.740
 talked about very unpleasant feelings 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.600
 when moving along the corridor on 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.040
 throughout the journey did not leave them 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.200
 feeling that something terrible is going to happen 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.270
 at some point the player can no longer 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.280
 keep going for a while 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.530
 nothing happens yet strange 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.960
 sprite that describes as a ticket taker 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.770
 somehow twists instead of beating not 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.540
 appears in front of the player 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.160
 who played the game recall that the chain 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.350
 or fear at the sight of a sprite 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.600
 called a whirlwind blue man 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.790
 nothing happens for a while 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.550
 until there is a piercing scream and 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.960
 graphic glitches do not start this 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.100
 lasts for several 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.000
 minutes squeal while not interrupted after 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.100
 this player abruptly returns the lobby 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.870
 graphics and sound becomes the same game 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.370
 continues normally on 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.860
 over several cycles 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.020
 although some players claim that 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.680
 a whirlwind of head and man now and then for a share 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.550
 seconds appears at the corners of the screen 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.070
 accompanied by a short and sound 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.560
 effect further at some point after 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.610
 meeting with a whirlwind head man player 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.550
 sees the ticket collectors 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.770
 running back and forth while doing so 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.090
 animation walk no limb ticketer 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.950
 remain motionless 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.960
 only sprite jumps a little 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.490
 wide open eyes and mouth give out 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.070
 character concern 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.870
 some players noted that posters on 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.190
 walls can be replaced by an image 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.620
 wi-fi and man's head 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.420
 what made the players turn away from 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.460
 them and get close to nagging 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.300
 after that another was played 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.100
 audio recording 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.140
 however, the text at the bottom of the screen is entirely 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.380
 consists of highly distorted characters 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.210
 which makes it unreadable by virtue 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.010
 extremely low quality audio recordings 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.180
 the question of what the grind says 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.820
 remains open 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.470
 however the most common version is not 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.380
 reaching the next levels 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.730
 the screen goes dead again the player again 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.950
 turns out the lobby 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.010
 however, the ticket collector is no longer visible and the passage 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.390
 blocked by sprite brick wall 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.840
 getting close to the wall instantly 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.220
 causes a crash on the desktop 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.370
 all original copies of the game were 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.500
 destroyed or lost however by 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.630
 creepy part of the story is that playing 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.210
 the theater claim that from time to time 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.210
 sees the crane through the eyes of krigg new man
