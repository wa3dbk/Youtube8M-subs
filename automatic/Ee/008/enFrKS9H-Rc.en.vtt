are somewhat aggressive but this side I
don't<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:49.040> why<00:02:49.220> as<00:02:50.209> teeth<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.079> side<00:02:51.260> if

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.270 
don't know why as teeth on this side if
really<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:53.390> not<00:02:53.510> really<00:02:53.799> really<00:02:54.799> taken<00:02:55.130> out

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280

of it but part of the blade I guess a

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.479 
of it but part of the blade I guess a
little<00:02:58.940> more<00:02:59.120> stopping<00:02:59.390> power<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.019> and

that's<00:04:23.150> one<00:04:23.360> reason<00:04:23.510> why<00:04:23.659> I<00:04:23.780> don't<00:04:24.020> like<00:04:24.169> to

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
that's one reason why I don't like to

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.960 
that's one reason why I don't like to
specialize<00:04:25.010> but

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
specialize but

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.630 
specialize but
I<00:04:26.060> mean<00:04:26.390> still<00:04:26.630> good<00:04:26.810> night<00:04:26.990> pretty<00:04:27.320> much<00:04:27.640> has

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
I mean still good night pretty much has

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.880 
I mean still good night pretty much has
some<00:04:28.880> teeth<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.300> pretty<00:04:30.200> much<00:04:30.440> aggressive

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
some teeth on it pretty much aggressive

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.240 
some teeth on it pretty much aggressive
also<00:04:31.660> it<00:04:32.660> has<00:04:33.020> it's<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.530> little<00:04:33.740> bigger<00:04:33.920> than

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
also it has it's a little bigger than

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.710 
also it has it's a little bigger than
the<00:04:34.930> speedster<00:04:35.930> model<00:04:36.670> of<00:04:37.670> course<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.570> was

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
the speedster model of course this was

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.030 
the speedster model of course this was
so<00:04:38.960> this<00:04:39.110> was<00:04:39.290> going<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.470> have<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.590> little<00:04:39.770> tiny

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
so this was going to have a little tiny

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.330 
so this was going to have a little tiny
bit<00:04:40.160> more<00:04:40.460> stopping<00:04:40.850> power<00:04:41.000> when<00:04:41.420> if<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:41.900> ever

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
bit more stopping power when if you ever

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.530 
bit more stopping power when if you ever
come<00:04:43.340> towards<00:04:43.640> an<00:04:43.730> attacker<00:04:44.000> or<00:04:44.180> something

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
come towards an attacker or something

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.750 
come towards an attacker or something
that's<00:04:44.840> trying<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.620> get<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:45.950> or<00:04:46.430> whatever

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
that's trying to get you or whatever

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.500 
that's trying to get you or whatever
reason<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:48.920> is<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.100> one<00:04:49.340> for<00:04:49.640> me<00:04:50.390> I

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
reason so this is the one for me I

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.700 
reason so this is the one for me I
didn't<00:04:50.900> really<00:04:51.020> like<00:04:51.230> this<00:04:51.440> one<00:04:51.590> because

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
didn't really like this one because

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.390 
didn't really like this one because
course<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:53.000> not<00:04:53.320> fast<00:04:54.320> or<00:04:54.830> anything<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:55.370> just

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
course is not fast or anything you just

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.880 
course is not fast or anything you just
can't<00:04:55.910> really<00:04:56.210> do<00:04:57.200> much<00:04:57.230> with<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:59.680> plus<00:05:00.680> has

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
can't really do much with it so plus has

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.430 
can't really do much with it so plus has
a<00:05:00.920> little<00:05:01.160> grip<00:05:01.430> here<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.570> have<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:03.230> better

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
a little grip here and to have a better

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.680 
a little grip here and to have a better
hold<00:05:03.950> and<00:05:04.310> fuel<00:05:04.580> of<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.180> knife<00:05:05.360> of

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
hold and fuel of it of the knife of

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.050 
hold and fuel of it of the knife of
course<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:08.030> reason<00:05:08.240> i<00:05:08.630> mean<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:10.250> i<00:05:10.310> bought

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
course the reason i mean but i bought

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.030 
course the reason i mean but i bought
the<00:05:11.210> speedster<00:05:11.630> was<00:05:11.810> pretty<00:05:12.050> much<00:05:12.200> i<00:05:12.740> did

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
the speedster was pretty much i did

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.870 
the speedster was pretty much i did
fling<00:05:13.820> out<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.120> knife<00:05:14.300> for<00:05:14.600> this<00:05:15.470> one<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:15.880> kind

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
fling out the knife for this one so kind

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.430 
fling out the knife for this one so kind
of<00:05:16.970> had<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.800> like<00:05:18.800> my<00:05:18.950> wrist<00:05:19.190> on<00:05:19.340> news<00:05:20.290> and<00:05:21.290> I

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
of had to like my wrist on news and I

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.250 
of had to like my wrist on news and I
got<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:22.270> little<00:05:23.270> more<00:05:23.480> difficult<00:05:23.660> that's<00:05:24.050> why

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
got a little more difficult that's why

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.230 
got a little more difficult that's why
too<00:05:24.790> so<00:05:25.790> on<00:05:25.880> this<00:05:26.030> one<00:05:26.240> in<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.740> speedster<00:05:28.240> and

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
too so on this one in the speedster and

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.890 
too so on this one in the speedster and
as<00:05:29.360> you<00:05:29.480> can<00:05:29.660> see<00:05:31.419> speech<00:05:32.419> there's<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.750> little

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
as you can see speech there's a little

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.110 
as you can see speech there's a little
shorter<00:05:33.380> by<00:05:33.710> bleh<00:05:34.040> drink<00:05:34.340> length<00:05:34.760> a<00:05:35.410> little

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
shorter by bleh drink length a little

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.350 
shorter by bleh drink length a little
little<00:05:38.120> more<00:05:38.330> time<00:05:38.900> top<00:05:39.890> smaller<00:05:40.250> by<00:05:40.640> the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
little more time top smaller by the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.560 
little more time top smaller by the
width<00:05:41.570> of<00:05:41.780> nice<00:05:41.990> also<00:05:42.320> I<00:05:43.000> mean<00:05:44.000> plus<00:05:44.300> is<00:05:44.419> more

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
width of nice also I mean plus is more

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.240 
width of nice also I mean plus is more
compact<00:05:44.960> so<00:05:45.140> you<00:05:45.200> get<00:05:45.380> hiding<00:05:45.680> in<00:05:45.770> your<00:05:45.800> pocket

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
compact so you get hiding in your pocket

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.070 
compact so you get hiding in your pocket
a<00:05:46.280> little<00:05:46.490> more<00:05:46.610> easier<00:05:46.940> when<00:05:47.810> you're<00:05:47.900> trying

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
a little more easier when you're trying

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.219 
a little more easier when you're trying
to<00:05:48.200> put<00:05:48.350> it<00:05:48.440> away<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:48.919> whatnot<00:05:49.370> so<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:51.140> you

to put it away and whatnot so and you
got<00:05:51.410> these<00:05:51.590> two<00:05:51.830> pretty<00:05:52.640> much<00:05:52.820> plus<00:05:53.120> this<00:05:53.330> one

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
got these two pretty much plus this one

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.080 
got these two pretty much plus this one
doesn't<00:05:53.780> come<00:05:53.930> with<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.700> seatbelt<00:05:55.700> cutter<00:05:55.880> as

this<00:05:56.210> one<00:05:56.419> does<00:05:56.450> but<00:05:56.630> either<00:05:57.350> way<00:05:57.560> you<00:05:57.620> can

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
this one does but either way you can

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.460 
this one does but either way you can
still<00:05:57.979> use<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.160> knife<00:05:58.820> as<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.290> seatbelt<00:06:00.290> cutter
