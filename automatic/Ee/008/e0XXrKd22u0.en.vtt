this
that's<00:02:24.110> worse<00:02:24.320> time<00:02:24.470> I've<00:02:24.560> done<00:02:24.710> it<00:02:24.770> oh<00:02:25.040> really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
that's worse time I've done it oh really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.610 
that's worse time I've done it oh really
yes<00:02:25.640> because<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.690> would<00:02:27.080> consider<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.440> maybe

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
yes because I would consider that maybe

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.780 
yes because I would consider that maybe
a<00:02:27.740> little<00:02:27.890> bit<00:02:28.070> easier<00:02:28.370> because<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:28.730> to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
a little bit easier because you get to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.100 
a little bit easier because you get to
walk<00:02:28.940> out<00:02:29.090> there<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.450> actually<00:02:29.600> check<00:02:29.930> your

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
walk out there and actually check your

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.600 
walk out there and actually check your
mind<00:02:30.290> some<00:02:30.530> very<00:02:30.709> good<00:02:30.830> events<00:02:31.220> in<00:02:31.310> Europe

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
