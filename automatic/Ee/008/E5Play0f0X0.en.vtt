00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.320
 most of us have heard that from 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.419
 dandelion leaves can be cooked 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.970
 salad but most likely few seriously 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:20.930
 perceives this plant as a kind 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.590
 component nutrition and does not attach importance 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.420
 and let's say its beneficial properties can 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.220
 be even few people know that two chick 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.590
 considered medicinal plants 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.730
 So I propose to deal with this 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.160
 dandelion is wrong 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:43.070
 simple as it may seem at first 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.519
 look in its composition many such important 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.050
 elements say trace elements 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.079
 lack of which or lack of 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.109
 which food seriously affects 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.239
 dandelion health a lot of iron 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.690
 dandelions high calcium 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.600
 protein vitamins a and c 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.729
 that is, even if nothing else 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.490
 consider there this composition 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.219
 talks about the importance of dandelion 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.439
 in nutrition not even mention there a 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.710
 treatment that is calcium which 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:22.189
 it contains it helps to strengthen 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.590
 bones we know this antioxidants these 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.409
 vitamins they help protect 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 bones from all sorts of age 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.039
 changes from reducing their strength 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.850
 iron density we know this is a compound 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.439
 part of hemoglobin and proteins and vitamins 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.049
 needed to form red 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:47.179
 blood cells and other components 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.579
 blood that is to those who suffer from anemia 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.920
 or other blood diseases worth 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.359
 pay close attention to 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.100
 this dandelion plant has a mass 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.740
 other useful properties it is very 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.820
 beneficial effect on the liver even to them 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.009
 treat jaundice well and generally it is good 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.220
 let's say so stimulates all 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.040
 digestive system 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.810
 dandelion helps and pancreas 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.109
 iron, that is, if there are any 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.129
 disturbances in the formation of insulin then 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:25.040
 dandelion can adjust it all 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.730
 that will help to normalize the level of sugar 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.569
 in blood 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.450
 and 2 chicks reduces the pressure he has 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.840
 diuretic action 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.079
 cleans the kidneys bactericidal properties 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.329
 fights those microbes that can 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:49.069
 it is in the kidneys that grow what else 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:50.389
 we dandelion well, perhaps so important 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.489
 property after all this is strong 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.709
 multivitamin remedy since it 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.769
 known since antiquity as a means 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:03.349
 treated with scurvy rather heavy 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.310
 disease all these healing properties 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:11.090
 make 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:13.819
 dandelion just by some gift from 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.889
 nature which is really a gift to us 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.620
 gets you don't buy it in the market you 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:23.060
 you can only collect it absolutely 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.220
 for free anywhere in the meadow I personally 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.650
 dandelion discovered himself not so long ago 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.409
 last spring 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.930
 just heard on y tube a lecture about 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.790
 the benefits of wild plants that is wild 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.739
 plants well the lecture was food that is 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.829
 some therapeutic or beneficial properties 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.780
 and it was said about what was said 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.060
 you can cook pretty good 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.780
 salad but not from the leaves namely 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.150
 dandelion stalks 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.449
 I just heard about the leaves but never 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.389
 did not make the garden because the leaves are bitter and 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:04:00.019
 they need to parboil well, I do not 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:03.560
 fits i mean i think so 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:06.470
 processing she most of the good as 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.400
 would nullify so hearing lectures 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.069
 about the stems I just went gathered these 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.049
 the stems are some leaves too 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.630
 and decided to try what kind of salad 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.849
 I get get pretty 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.210
 not bad I just finely cut de 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:24.580
 stalks and they have some root 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.340
 but she rather 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.789
 such a note passes not to say that 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.139
 kind of intrusive and if you use 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:39.990
 lemon juice then this bitterness becomes 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:43.090
 almost imperceptible lemon juice spices 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.729
 some kind of good cooking oil 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.060
 can be long used or sesame 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.210
 and in this form is quite 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:57.759
 it's edible let alone as far as it is 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:02.050
 helpful i liked it then i added 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:04.060
 leaves and a little bit they really 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.219
 I have the bitterness did not pour over 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.770
 boiled water just finely cut but also 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:11.740
 season was young radish that is 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.360
 I was pretty good 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.650
 Salad I think there can be still 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.659
 experiment that is and cucumbers and 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.659
 tomatoes bell pepper 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.449
 but all you can try 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.699
 add you can fill try there 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.740
 not butter but for example some 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.120
 mayonnaise but naturally it is not 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.270
 mayonnaise store 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.599
 and about some useful home 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:41.800
 which you did yourself like that 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:47.830
 it seems worth paying attention to 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:51.279
 this plant and it doesn't matter whether you are 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:55.839
 vegetarian or not all the same concern for 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:59.400
 health is inherent in all and included in 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:02.889
 your diet are such plants 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.889
 Well, universal can be said in my own way 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.050
 according to its effects, it is not 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.969
 has no contraindications ie 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.219
 he does not harm anyone but maybe to someone 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.589
 it is an unusual taste but this is all a matter 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.529
 really habits and if 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:20.080
 realize how useful it is i 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:24.539
 I think here the question of taste and even stand 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.539
 you will not like it 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.780
 Well, on this I can wish you 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:36.789
 that spring is just around the corner 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:40.930
