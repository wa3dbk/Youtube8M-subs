00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
three or four games I played with him I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.810 
three or four games I played with him I
managed<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> score<00:01:58.079> 12<00:01:58.950> goals<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.549> him<00:01:59.670> which

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
managed to score 12 goals with him which

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.120 
managed to score 12 goals with him which
is<00:01:59.939> crazy<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.840> he<00:02:01.350> scored<00:02:01.649> something<00:02:01.979> like

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
is crazy and he scored something like

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
is crazy and he scored something like
seven<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:02.850> game<00:02:02.880> which<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.390> absolutely

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
seven in one game which is absolutely

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.139 
seven in one game which is absolutely
nuts<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:05.070> those<00:02:05.399> highlights<00:02:05.850> should<00:02:06.030> be

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
nuts I think those highlights should be

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.410 
nuts I think those highlights should be
throwing<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.110> second<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:07.829> yeah<00:02:08.550> 7

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
throwing up in just a second but yeah 7

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.750 
throwing up in just a second but yeah 7
in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> game<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.080> completely<00:02:10.259> nuts

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
in the game is completely nuts

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.479 
in the game is completely nuts
he's<00:02:12.239> actually<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.470> surprisingly<00:02:14.040> clinical

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
he's actually a surprisingly clinical

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.610 
he's actually a surprisingly clinical
finisher<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.060> his<00:02:15.510> finish<00:02:15.780> shots<00:02:15.989> very<00:02:16.260> nice

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
finisher and his finish shots very nice

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.039 
finisher and his finish shots very nice
his<00:02:17.549> power<00:02:17.790> shots<00:02:18.030> quite<00:02:18.299> nice<00:02:18.510> too<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:18.989> i

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
his power shots quite nice too but i

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.990 
his power shots quite nice too but i
would<00:02:19.290> say<00:02:19.470> his<00:02:19.739> finesse<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.250> actually<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
would say his finesse is actually a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.179 
would say his finesse is actually a
little<00:02:21.209> bit<00:02:21.450> better<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:22.110> two<00:02:22.620> despite<00:02:22.980> his

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
little bit better and two despite his

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.649 
little bit better and two despite his
low<00:02:23.370> jumping<00:02:23.790> snotty<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.209> actually<00:02:24.480> win

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
low jumping snotty can actually win

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.050 
low jumping snotty can actually win
quite<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> few<00:02:25.110> headers<00:02:25.489> you'll<00:02:26.489> see<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> think

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
quite a few headers you'll see I think

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.390 
quite a few headers you'll see I think
three<00:02:27.659> or<00:02:27.689> four<00:02:28.019> headed<00:02:28.620> goals<00:02:28.829> here<00:02:29.099> as<00:02:29.250> well

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
three or four headed goals here as well

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.789 
three or four headed goals here as well
so<00:02:29.780> he<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.900> definitely<00:02:30.989> score<00:02:31.500> headers

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
so he can definitely score headers

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.710 
so he can definitely score headers
despite<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.790> stat<00:02:33.269> which<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.569> would<00:02:33.659> expect

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
despite that stat which you would expect

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.050 
despite that stat which you would expect
me<00:02:34.170> he<00:02:34.560> couldn't<00:02:34.769> score<00:02:34.980> any<00:02:35.190> headers<00:02:35.340> he

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
me he couldn't score any headers he

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.149 
me he couldn't score any headers he
could<00:02:36.180> also<00:02:36.299> scored<00:02:36.629> his<00:02:36.810> left<00:02:37.110> foot<00:02:37.349> a<00:02:37.709> couple

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
could also scored his left foot a couple

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.490 
could also scored his left foot a couple
of<00:02:38.220> left-footed<00:02:38.609> highlights<00:02:39.269> here<00:02:39.510> too<00:02:39.840> so

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
of left-footed highlights here too so

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.440 
of left-footed highlights here too so
this<00:02:40.739> guy<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.099> very<00:02:41.340> clinical<00:02:41.819> finisher<00:02:42.269> I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
this guy is a very clinical finisher I

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.740 
this guy is a very clinical finisher I
would<00:02:43.319> compare<00:02:43.620> him<00:02:43.859> to<00:02:44.159> any<00:02:45.030> slower<00:02:45.420> version

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
would compare him to any slower version

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.250 
would compare him to any slower version
of<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:47.190> team<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.609> year<00:02:47.640> Huntelaar<00:02:48.260> he's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
of the team of the year Huntelaar he's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.199 
of the team of the year Huntelaar he's
not<00:02:49.379> as<00:02:49.560> clinical<00:02:50.159> but<00:02:50.549> he<00:02:50.879> does<00:02:51.030> actually

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
not as clinical but he does actually

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.729 
not as clinical but he does actually
have<00:02:51.450> forced<00:02:51.780> our<00:02:51.840> skills<00:02:52.109> as<00:02:52.260> well<00:02:52.409> which<00:02:52.620> is

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
have forced our skills as well which is

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.640 
have forced our skills as well which is
a<00:02:52.769> big<00:02:53.040> plus<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.579> my<00:02:53.639> book<00:02:54.180> anyway<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.500> that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
a big plus in my book anyway so that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.170 
a big plus in my book anyway so that

him he didn't really score very many I'm
not<00:03:06.269> even<00:03:06.690> sure<00:03:06.720> if<00:03:06.959> he<00:03:07.019> scored<00:03:07.319> any<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.950> his<00:03:08.639> I

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
not even sure if he scored any and his I

not even sure if he scored any and his I
acceleration<00:03:09.389> is<00:03:09.950> noticeably<00:03:10.950> slow<00:03:11.280> once<00:03:12.030> you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
acceleration is noticeably slow once you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.430 
acceleration is noticeably slow once you
just<00:03:12.269> get<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.659> his<00:03:12.780> full<00:03:12.959> sprint<00:03:13.260> speed

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
just get up to his full sprint speed

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.520 
just get up to his full sprint speed
it's<00:03:13.700> pretty<00:03:14.700> okay<00:03:14.879> you'd<00:03:15.810> already<00:03:15.959> notice

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
it's pretty okay you'd already notice

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.509 
it's pretty okay you'd already notice
the<00:03:16.680> paste<00:03:16.889> thing<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:17.639> his<00:03:18.540> acceleration<00:03:19.519> is

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the paste thing but his acceleration is

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.150 
the paste thing but his acceleration is
pretty<00:03:20.819> pretty<00:03:21.359> poor<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.980> he<00:03:22.980> definitely

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
pretty pretty poor and he definitely

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.030 
pretty pretty poor and he definitely
starts<00:03:23.819> out<00:03:23.940> running<00:03:24.239> pretty<00:03:24.389> slow<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:25.410> he

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
starts out running pretty slow and he

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.589 
starts out running pretty slow and he

slower<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.310> apart<00:03:59.639> from<00:03:59.669> that<00:03:59.819> she's

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
slower but apart from that she's
