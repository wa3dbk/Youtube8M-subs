00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.529 
March 29 2013 it's a nice sunny day it's
about<00:00:16.310> minus<00:00:17.310> six<00:00:18.240> outside<00:00:20.029> let's<00:00:21.029> go<00:00:21.180> take<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
about minus six outside let's go take a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
about minus six outside let's go take a
look<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.380> solar<00:00:22.800> system<00:00:23.310> is

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
look and see how the solar system is

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.990 
look and see how the solar system is
doing<00:00:24.800> as<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.550> pretty

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
doing as you can see it's very pretty

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:45.590 
doing as you can see it's very pretty
out<00:00:27.980> here's<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.189> dog<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:43.969> keep<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.120> batteries

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
out here's my dog I keep my batteries

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
out here's my dog I keep my batteries
out<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> set<00:00:46.200> shed<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.579> do

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
out in the set shed so we do have to do

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.049 
out in the set shed so we do have to do
the<00:00:48.239> cold<00:00:48.600> compensation<00:00:49.440> thing<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:51.000> do

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the cold compensation thing but they do

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.900 
the cold compensation thing but they do
very<00:00:51.390> well<00:00:52.160> just<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.489> sure<00:00:53.550> they're

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
very well just got to make sure they're

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.010 
very well just got to make sure they're
charged<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.050> cold<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
charged up when it's really cold out I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.869 
charged up when it's really cold out I
bought<00:00:58.020> an<00:00:58.170> 80-degree<00:00:58.649> angle<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.280> their<00:00:59.550> force

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
bought an 80-degree angle on their force

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.360 
bought an 80-degree angle on their force
no<00:01:00.090> shedding<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> temporary<00:01:01.680> location

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
no shedding this is a temporary location

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.000 
no shedding this is a temporary location
though<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:03.350> they're<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> be

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
though is they're all going to be

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.340 
though is they're all going to be
relocated<00:01:05.479> with<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> rest<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.110> solar

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
relocated with the rest of my solar

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.640 
relocated with the rest of my solar
system<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.070> summer<00:01:09.020> when<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.049> build<00:01:10.470> our

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
system this summer when we build our

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
system this summer when we build our
garage<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.659> we're<00:01:13.310> still<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
garage as you can see we're still in the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
garage as you can see we're still in the
process<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.299> building

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.289 

it's<00:01:23.770> worked<00:01:24.039> out<00:01:24.219> really<00:01:24.280> quite<00:01:24.789> well<00:01:25.030> I've

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
it's worked out really quite well I've

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.760 
it's worked out really quite well I've
got<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:25.600> 1500<00:01:26.380> amp<00:01:26.560> hour<00:01:26.770> battery<00:01:26.890> bank<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:28.770> we

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
got a 1500 amp hour battery bank and we

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.289 
got a 1500 amp hour battery bank and we
just<00:01:29.979> threw<00:01:30.130> some<00:01:30.310> insulation<00:01:30.670> on<00:01:30.939> top<00:01:33.299> we

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
just threw some insulation on top we

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.370 
just threw some insulation on top we
have<00:01:36.149> water<00:01:37.149> misers<00:01:37.479> on<00:01:37.899> most<00:01:38.140> of<00:01:38.350> them

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
have water misers on most of them

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.440 
have water misers on most of them
that'll<00:01:41.380> reduce<00:01:41.859> the<00:01:42.810> watering<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.990> my<00:01:44.229> bank

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that'll reduce the watering of my bank

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.029 
that'll reduce the watering of my bank
you<00:01:46.450> know<00:01:46.569> it<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.959> really<00:01:47.259> important<00:01:47.859> though

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
you know it is really important though

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.679 
you know it is really important though
when<00:01:48.369> you're<00:01:48.459> equalizing<00:01:49.209> your<00:01:49.329> battery

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
when you're equalizing your battery

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.010 
when you're equalizing your battery
think<00:01:50.849> once<00:01:51.849> a<00:01:52.030> year<00:01:52.209> there<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:55.020> remove

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
think once a year there that you remove

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.959 
think once a year there that you remove
the<00:01:56.200> water<00:01:56.409> misers<00:01:56.770> while<00:01:57.369> you're<00:01:57.610> doing<00:01:57.789> that

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
the water misers while you're doing that

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:05.240 
the water misers while you're doing that
so<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.479> recommend<00:01:58.929> that<00:01:59.349> you<00:01:59.619> go<00:01:59.829> on<00:02:00.099> a<00:02:00.599> manual

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.440 

equalization<00:02:06.250> run<00:02:06.489> because<00:02:06.849> that<00:02:07.299> way<00:02:07.420> you

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
equalization run because that way you

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.780 
equalization run because that way you
can<00:02:07.780> choose<00:02:08.110> when<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.470> do<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:11.250> okay<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.310> let's

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
can choose when to do it okay so let's

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.050 
can choose when to do it okay so let's
see<00:02:13.030> how<00:02:13.060> we're<00:02:13.329> doing<00:02:13.359> today<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.760> quite

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
see how we're doing today I'm not quite

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.759 
see how we're doing today I'm not quite
sure<00:02:16.090> how<00:02:16.390> we're<00:02:16.720> gonna<00:02:16.780> do<00:02:17.049> this<00:02:17.079> it's<00:02:17.470> so

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
sure how we're gonna do this it's so

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:36.090 
sure how we're gonna do this it's so
bright<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.250> can't<00:02:18.760> see<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.450> screen<00:02:19.660> here

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.090 

okay<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.160> right<00:02:37.520> now<00:02:37.550> our<00:02:38.200> 48<00:02:39.200> volt<00:02:39.590> battery

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
okay so right now our 48 volt battery

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.260 
okay so right now our 48 volt battery
bank<00:02:40.460> is<00:02:40.960> sitting<00:02:41.960> at<00:02:42.250> 51<00:02:43.250> volts<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.920> our<00:02:46.270> 2.2

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.510 
watts and we've got 42 apps can you see
that<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.560> know<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.950> little<00:03:04.070> bit<00:03:04.310> difficult

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
that I know it's a little bit difficult
