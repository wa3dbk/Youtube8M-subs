00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
find they sort of sticky out of the heat

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.310 
find they sort of sticky out of the heat
shrink<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.480> look<00:01:00.660> quite<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.109> nice<00:01:03.320> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320

can get right on to sleeving now now
I'll<00:02:05.369> start<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> sleeve<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.600> where<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
I'll start the sleeve at about where the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.639 
I'll start the sleeve at about where the
connector<00:02:07.439> starts<00:02:07.890> there

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
connector starts there

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.380 
connector starts there
talk<00:02:09.519> about<00:02:09.670> where<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.849> connector<00:02:10.209> ends

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
talk about where the connector ends

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.319 
talk about where the connector ends
there<00:02:11.040> because<00:02:12.040> we<00:02:12.189> want<00:02:12.340> enough<00:02:12.700> heat<00:02:13.030> shrink

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
there because we want enough heat shrink

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.170 
there because we want enough heat shrink
to<00:02:13.769> grab<00:02:14.769> onto<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.340> sleeve<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.879> make<00:02:15.939> sure

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
to grab onto the sleeve to make sure

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.990 
to grab onto the sleeve to make sure
that<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.390> doesn't<00:02:16.540> slip<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.640> measure

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
that it doesn't slip out so just measure

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.640 
that it doesn't slip out so just measure
that<00:02:19.239> out<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.720> cut<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:19.989> out<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.439> I'll<00:02:20.530> be

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
that out and cut it out and I'll be

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.479 
that out and cut it out and I'll be
right<00:02:20.799> back<00:02:22.439> so<00:02:23.439> now<00:02:23.620> as<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.769> can<00:02:23.980> see<00:02:24.040> I've

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
right back so now as you can see I've

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.309 
right back so now as you can see I've
gone<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.909> cut<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.269> piece<00:02:25.569> of<00:02:25.720> sleeve<00:02:26.049> it's

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
gone and cut the piece of sleeve it's

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.399 
gone and cut the piece of sleeve it's
roughly<00:02:26.709> 75<00:02:27.370> millimeters<00:02:27.939> long<00:02:28.180> I've<00:02:28.420> cut<00:02:29.230> two

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
roughly 75 millimeters long I've cut two

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.990 
roughly 75 millimeters long I've cut two
pieces<00:02:29.439> of<00:02:29.859> heat<00:02:30.040> shrink<00:02:30.069> which<00:02:30.430> are<00:02:30.579> 20

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
pieces of heat shrink which are 20

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.630 
pieces of heat shrink which are 20
millimeters<00:02:31.599> long<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.859> found<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.430> worked

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
millimeters long I found that worked

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.099 
millimeters long I found that worked
quite<00:02:33.700> well<00:02:33.909> for<00:02:34.090> me<00:02:34.269> last<00:02:34.569> time<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.810> did<00:02:35.019> the

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
quite well for me last time I did the

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.559 
quite well for me last time I did the
cable<00:02:35.489> now<00:02:36.489> I'll<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:37.000> ahead<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.329> put

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
cable now I'll just go ahead and put

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.710 
cable now I'll just go ahead and put
this<00:02:37.780> piece<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.680> sleeve<00:02:38.920> onto<00:02:39.159> the<00:02:39.340> cable<00:02:39.760> I

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
this piece of sleeve onto the cable I

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.390 
this piece of sleeve onto the cable I
imagine<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.560> won't<00:02:41.889> be<00:02:41.980> able<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.159> do<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.310> with

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
imagine I won't be able to do it with

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.830 
imagine I won't be able to do it with
one<00:02:42.609> hand<00:02:42.639> unfortunately<00:02:43.569> don't<00:02:43.629> have<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
one hand unfortunately don't have a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.240 
one hand unfortunately don't have a
cameraman<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.440> hold<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> camera<00:02:44.859> for<00:02:45.010> me

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
cameraman to hold the camera for me

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.309 
cameraman to hold the camera for me
while<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.489> do<00:02:45.639> it

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
while I do it

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.839 
while I do it
but<00:02:47.319> last<00:02:47.560> time<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.190> put<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.519> cable

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
but last time I just put the cable

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.539 
but last time I just put the cable
straight<00:02:49.269> on<00:02:49.510> as<00:02:49.750> opposed<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.409> putting<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.370> up

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
straight on as opposed to putting it up

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.280 
straight on as opposed to putting it up
onto<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:52.060> connector<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.450> then<00:02:52.659> around<00:02:52.930> onto

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
onto the connector and then around onto

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.319 
onto the connector and then around onto
the<00:02:53.379> cable<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.920> was<00:02:54.519> able<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.790> stretch<00:02:55.120> it

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
the cable I was able to stretch it

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.199 
the cable I was able to stretch it
enough<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.810> put<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.139> sleeve<00:02:56.680> back<00:02:56.709> on<00:02:57.220> now

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
enough to put the sleeve back on now

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.330 
enough to put the sleeve back on now
I'll<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.480> set<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.870> camera<00:02:59.170> down<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.709> do

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
I'll just set the camera down and do

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.949 
I'll just set the camera down and do
that<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:00.819> I'll<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.180> right<00:03:01.389> back

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
that and then I'll be right back

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.780 
that and then I'll be right back
to<00:03:02.470> show<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.739> what<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.129> looks<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.430> when<00:03:03.639> it's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
to show you what it looks like when it's

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.500 
to show you what it looks like when it's
on<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.980> there<00:03:06.159> it<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.549> piece<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.849> sleeve<00:03:07.180> is

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
on so there it is the piece of sleeve is

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.080 
on so there it is the piece of sleeve is
on<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.230> cable<00:03:08.470> as<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.430> can<00:03:09.549> see<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:09.819> quite<00:03:10.000> a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
on the cable as you can see it's quite a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.789 
on the cable as you can see it's quite a
lot<00:03:10.239> shorter<00:03:10.510> now<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.049> it's<00:03:11.139> on<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.409> cable

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
lot shorter now that it's on the cable

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.069 
lot shorter now that it's on the cable
but<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.639> noticed<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.180> with<00:03:13.299> my<00:03:13.419> other<00:03:13.629> cable

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
but I noticed that with my other cable

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.129 
but I noticed that with my other cable
it<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.410> also<00:03:14.560> roughly<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.280> length<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.150> as

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
it was also roughly that length and as

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.869 
it was also roughly that length and as
you<00:03:17.290> can<00:03:17.440> see<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.769> piece<00:03:17.919> of<00:03:18.069> heat<00:03:18.250> shrink<00:03:18.310> is

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
you can see the piece of heat shrink is

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.619 
you can see the piece of heat shrink is
just<00:03:19.919> overlapping<00:03:20.919> enough<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.819> hold<00:03:22.329> the

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
just overlapping enough to hold the

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.409 
just overlapping enough to hold the
sleeve<00:03:23.019> in<00:03:23.199> place<00:03:23.879> another<00:03:24.879> quick<00:03:25.120> thing<00:03:25.150> to

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
sleeve in place another quick thing to

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.539 
sleeve in place another quick thing to
note<00:03:25.659> is<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.230> make<00:03:26.470> sure<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.799> do<00:03:26.980> use<00:03:27.280> your

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
note is that make sure you do use your

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.680 
note is that make sure you do use your
light<00:03:28.120> or<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.329> heat<00:03:28.510> gun<00:03:28.629> or<00:03:28.720> whatever<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:30.690> to

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
light or a heat gun or whatever to to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.809 
light or a heat gun or whatever to to
burn<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.169> cut<00:03:32.530> where<00:03:32.889> you've<00:03:33.069> cut<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.549> sleeve

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
burn the cut where you've cut the sleeve

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.780 
burn the cut where you've cut the sleeve
because<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.989> will<00:03:35.139> it<00:03:35.440> was<00:03:35.620> tricky<00:03:36.280> putting

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
because it will it was tricky putting

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.240 
because it will it was tricky putting
the<00:03:36.940> sleeve<00:03:37.540> onto<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.930> cable<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:39.069> don't

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
the sleeve onto the cable and you don't

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.770 
the sleeve onto the cable and you don't
want<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.549> fray<00:03:39.849> too<00:03:39.909> much<00:03:40.389> while<00:03:40.629> you're

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
want it to fray too much while you're

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.949 
want it to fray too much while you're
doing<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:43.209> I'll<00:03:43.269> just<00:03:43.389> go<00:03:43.510> ahead<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.810> put

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
doing that so I'll just go ahead and put

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.740 
doing that so I'll just go ahead and put
the<00:03:44.049> pieces<00:03:44.229> of<00:03:44.409> heat<00:03:44.590> shrink<00:03:44.620> on<00:03:45.540> one<00:03:46.540> thing

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the pieces of heat shrink on one thing

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.879 
the pieces of heat shrink on one thing
I've<00:03:46.840> got<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.989> do<00:03:47.169> with<00:03:47.349> putting<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.769> heat

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
I've got to do with putting the heat

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:48.869 
I've got to do with putting the heat
shrink<00:03:48.069> on<00:03:48.129> this<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.519> trick<00:03:48.729> to<00:03:48.849> doing

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
shrink on this is the trick to doing

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.210 
shrink on this is the trick to doing
this<00:03:49.180> cable<00:03:49.659> is<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.440> need<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.709> cut<00:03:51.010> a

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
this cable is you need to cut a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.619 
this cable is you need to cut a
rectangle<00:03:52.030> out<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.239> out<00:03:55.239> of<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.449> heat

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
rectangle out of the out of the heat

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.569 
rectangle out of the out of the heat
shrink<00:03:55.810> for<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.590> actual<00:03:56.829> connector<00:03:57.159> to<00:03:57.400> fit

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
shrink for the actual connector to fit

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.240 
shrink for the actual connector to fit
through<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.199> the<00:03:59.500> way<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.650> found<00:04:00.040> was

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
through and this is the way I found was

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.430 
through and this is the way I found was
best<00:04:00.489> for<00:04:00.729> doing<00:04:00.940> these<00:04:01.060> cables<00:04:01.510> I've<00:04:02.019> seen<00:04:02.319> it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
best for doing these cables I've seen it

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.099 
best for doing these cables I've seen it
being<00:04:02.620> done<00:04:02.799> differently<00:04:03.329> but<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.900> Way's

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
being done differently but this Way's

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.640 
being done differently but this Way's
worked<00:04:05.379> really<00:04:05.530> well<00:04:05.650> for<00:04:05.769> me<00:04:07.199> all<00:04:08.199> right<00:04:08.470> so

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
worked really well for me all right so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.819 
worked really well for me all right so
what<00:04:08.769> we<00:04:08.859> do<00:04:08.979> now<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.970> we<00:04:10.239> grab<00:04:10.449> a<00:04:10.720> sharp<00:04:11.470> blade

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
what we do now is we grab a sharp blade

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.610 
what we do now is we grab a sharp blade
or<00:04:12.159> knife<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.849> can't<00:04:13.629> seem<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.810> find<00:04:14.049> my<00:04:14.260> Stanley

or knife I can't seem to find my Stanley
knife<00:04:14.889> at<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.099> moment<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.579> we<00:04:15.639> have<00:04:15.669> to<00:04:15.819> use

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
knife at the moment and we have to use

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.420 
knife at the moment and we have to use
this<00:04:16.120> cheap<00:04:16.419> pocket<00:04:16.810> knife<00:04:16.959> but<00:04:17.709> it'll<00:04:18.190> do<00:04:18.310> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
this cheap pocket knife but it'll do the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.539 
this cheap pocket knife but it'll do the
job<00:04:18.459> just<00:04:19.709> measure<00:04:20.709> out

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
job just measure out

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.420 
job just measure out

relation to the piece of heat shrink

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.240 
relation to the piece of heat shrink
measure<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.300> out<00:04:28.419> and<00:04:28.659> cut<00:04:29.349> the<00:04:29.530> rectangle<00:04:29.710> out

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
measure it out and cut the rectangle out

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.879 
measure it out and cut the rectangle out
of<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.580> now<00:04:31.569> just<00:04:31.840> quickly<00:04:31.960> do<00:04:32.289> that<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.770> I'll

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
of it now just quickly do that and I'll

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.200 
of it now just quickly do that and I'll
be<00:04:33.009> right<00:04:33.190> back<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.610> then<00:04:33.699> we'll<00:04:33.819> fit<00:04:34.030> onto

be right back and then we'll fit onto

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.550 
be right back and then we'll fit onto
the<00:04:34.300> connector<00:04:34.629> and<00:04:34.840> shrink<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.139> on<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.440> see

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
the connector and shrink it on and see

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.689 
the connector and shrink it on and see
how<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.770> looks<00:04:37.860> all<00:04:38.860> right<00:04:39.009> now<00:04:39.220> one<00:04:39.430> thing<00:04:39.639> I

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
how it looks all right now one thing I

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.210 
how it looks all right now one thing I
forgot<00:04:39.819> to<00:04:40.000> mention<00:04:40.240> before<00:04:40.539> is<00:04:41.190> make<00:04:42.190> sure

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
forgot to mention before is make sure

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.270 
forgot to mention before is make sure
that<00:04:42.520> you've<00:04:42.669> put<00:04:43.120> something<00:04:43.509> in<00:04:43.659> between<00:04:44.280> the

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
the heat shrink two users of betting so

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.460 
the heat shrink two users of betting so
that<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.620> don't<00:04:47.830> cut<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.750> other<00:04:49.750> side<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.319> it

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
that you don't cut the other side of it

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.230 
that you don't cut the other side of it
and<00:04:51.460> when<00:04:51.729> you're<00:04:51.849> cutting<00:04:51.970> out<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
and when you're cutting out the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.899 
and when you're cutting out the
rectangle<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.590> as<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:53.949> can<00:04:54.069> see<00:04:54.129> I've<00:04:54.669> got

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
rectangle so as you can see I've got

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.820 
rectangle so as you can see I've got
that<00:04:55.060> rectangle<00:04:55.690> roughly<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.169> same<00:04:56.349> size<00:04:56.650> as

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
that rectangle roughly the same size as

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.309 
that rectangle roughly the same size as
the<00:04:56.979> connector<00:04:57.629> I'm<00:04:58.629> not<00:04:58.750> sure<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:58.990> can<00:04:59.050> do<00:04:59.199> this

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
the connector I'm not sure I can do this

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.830 
the connector I'm not sure I can do this
with<00:04:59.469> one<00:04:59.650> hand<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:01.210> might<00:05:01.389> just<00:05:01.539> get<00:05:01.629> back

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
with one hand so I might just get back

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.809 
with one hand so I might just get back
to<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.050> once<00:05:02.229> that's<00:05:02.530> on<00:05:02.830> then<00:05:03.520> we'll<00:05:03.669> shrink

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
to you once that's on then we'll shrink

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.170 
to you once that's on then we'll shrink
it<00:05:04.000> on<00:05:04.090> and<00:05:04.240> see<00:05:04.360> how<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.509> looks<00:05:05.610> all<00:05:06.610> right<00:05:06.669> so

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
it on and see how it looks all right so

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.820 
it on and see how it looks all right so
I've<00:05:07.270> put<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.629> piece<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:08.020> heat<00:05:08.139> shrink<00:05:08.199> on<00:05:08.590> as

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
I've put the piece of heat shrink on as

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.469 
I've put the piece of heat shrink on as
you<00:05:08.949> can<00:05:09.069> see<00:05:09.219> I<00:05:09.250> cut<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.669> rectangle<00:05:09.879> so<00:05:10.330> it's

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
you can see I cut the rectangle so it's

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.589 
you can see I cut the rectangle so it's
quite<00:05:10.719> a<00:05:10.780> tight<00:05:11.110> fit<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:13.210> I'll<00:05:13.270> just<00:05:13.419> go<00:05:13.569> ahead

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
quite a tight fit so I'll just go ahead

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.159 
quite a tight fit so I'll just go ahead
and<00:05:13.900> shrink<00:05:14.199> that<00:05:14.409> on<00:05:15.629> as<00:05:16.629> you<00:05:16.780> can<00:05:16.810> see<00:05:17.050> you

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
and shrink that on as you can see you

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.490 
and shrink that on as you can see you
know<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.379> the<00:05:17.650> heat<00:05:17.830> shrink<00:05:18.009> is<00:05:18.719> I've<00:05:19.719> cut<00:05:20.379> it

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
know the the heat shrink is I've cut it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.980 
know the the heat shrink is I've cut it
so<00:05:20.710> it's<00:05:20.889> perfectly<00:05:21.610> in<00:05:21.969> line<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.810> end

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
so it's perfectly in line with the end

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.379 
so it's perfectly in line with the end
of<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.229> cable<00:05:23.620> looks<00:05:24.490> like<00:05:24.819> it<00:05:24.940> measures<00:05:25.270> is

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
of the cable looks like it measures is

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:26.249 
of the cable looks like it measures is
up<00:05:25.509> fine

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
up fine

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.689 
up fine
now<00:05:26.560> we'll<00:05:26.770> shrink<00:05:27.009> it<00:05:27.130> on<00:05:27.219> and<00:05:27.430> see<00:05:27.550> how<00:05:27.580> it

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
now we'll shrink it on and see how it

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.140 
now we'll shrink it on and see how it
looks<00:05:28.800> all<00:05:29.800> right<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.279> I'm<00:05:30.370> going<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.610> try

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
looks all right so I'm going to try

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.610 
looks all right so I'm going to try
streaking<00:05:31.509> this<00:05:31.690> piece<00:05:31.960> of<00:05:32.080> heat<00:05:32.199> shrink<00:05:32.259> on

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
streaking this piece of heat shrink on

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:41.640 
streaking this piece of heat shrink on
now<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:34.060> see<00:05:34.449> how<00:05:34.479> it<00:05:34.719> looks<00:05:40.050> just<00:05:41.050> rotating

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
now and see how it looks just rotating

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.200 
now and see how it looks just rotating
it<00:05:41.710> around<00:05:41.860> so<00:05:42.370> it<00:05:42.639> doesn't<00:05:43.169> shrink<00:05:44.169> unevenly

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
it around so it doesn't shrink unevenly

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.420 
it around so it doesn't shrink unevenly
the<00:05:46.210> light<00:05:46.389> is<00:05:46.539> actually<00:05:46.690> quite<00:05:47.110> hot<00:05:47.440> he's

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
the light is actually quite hot he's

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.269 
the light is actually quite hot he's
blowing<00:05:48.699> out<00:05:49.259> light<00:05:50.259> is<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.650> light<00:05:50.680> is<00:05:50.860> quite

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
blowing out light is the light is quite

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.820 
blowing out light is the light is quite
hot<00:05:51.580> so<00:05:52.029> I'm<00:05:52.300> gonna<00:05:52.690> be<00:05:52.750> careful<00:05:53.020> not<00:05:53.139> to<00:05:53.409> hold

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
hot so I'm gonna be careful not to hold

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.080 
hot so I'm gonna be careful not to hold
it<00:05:53.949> too<00:05:54.099> close<00:05:54.150> or<00:05:56.550> you'll<00:05:57.550> mount<00:05:57.759> the<00:05:57.940> heat

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
it too close or you'll mount the heat

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.370 
it too close or you'll mount the heat
shrink

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.360 

and<00:06:05.380> of<00:06:05.530> course<00:06:05.710> you<00:06:05.770> can<00:06:05.890> be<00:06:05.950> careful<00:06:06.220> not<00:06:06.310> to

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
and of course you can be careful not to

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.710 
and of course you can be careful not to
mount<00:06:06.640> the<00:06:06.730> connector<00:06:06.910> as<00:06:07.210> well<00:06:07.390> because<00:06:07.600> it's

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
mount the connector as well because it's

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.090 
mount the connector as well because it's
also<00:06:07.900> just<00:06:08.170> placed<00:06:08.410> it<00:06:10.650> just<00:06:11.650> keep<00:06:11.860> checking

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
also just placed it just keep checking

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
also just placed it just keep checking
that<00:06:12.280> it's<00:06:13.170> in<00:06:14.170> line<00:06:14.230> as<00:06:14.800> it's<00:06:15.370> shrinking<00:06:15.610> and

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
that it's in line as it's shrinking and

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:34.950 
that it's in line as it's shrinking and
that<00:06:16.630> it<00:06:16.750> isn't<00:06:16.990> moving<00:06:17.110> around

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:44.670 

that's<00:06:35.960> looking<00:06:36.289> good

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.379 

now<00:06:45.680> there<00:06:45.860> isn't<00:06:45.979> actually<00:06:46.159> much<00:06:46.550> sleeve<00:06:47.060> in

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
now there isn't actually much sleeve in

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.540 
now there isn't actually much sleeve in
there<00:06:47.629> so<00:06:48.349> not<00:06:48.650> really<00:06:48.860> enough<00:06:49.039> to<00:06:49.189> cling<00:06:49.400> on

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
there so not really enough to cling on

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.550 
there so not really enough to cling on
so<00:06:49.729> I've<00:06:49.819> just<00:06:49.849> slid<00:06:50.449> the<00:06:50.659> sleeve<00:06:50.960> into<00:06:51.259> the

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
so I've just slid the sleeve into the

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.189 
so I've just slid the sleeve into the
heat<00:06:52.250> shrink<00:06:52.400> a<00:06:52.580> little<00:06:52.789> bit<00:06:52.879> more<00:06:53.169> before<00:06:54.169> I

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
heat shrink a little bit more before I

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:07.119 
heat shrink a little bit more before I
do<00:06:54.349> the<00:06:54.590> final<00:06:55.449> the<00:06:56.449> final<00:06:56.750> shrink<00:07:06.129> that's

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:07.129 
do the final the final shrink that's

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:09.730 
do the final the final shrink that's
looking<00:07:07.460> good<00:07:07.669> all<00:07:08.629> right<00:07:08.840> I'll<00:07:09.229> get<00:07:09.439> back<00:07:09.620> to

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
looking good all right I'll get back to

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.519 
looking good all right I'll get back to
you<00:07:09.830> when<00:07:09.949> this<00:07:10.069> is<00:07:10.129> all<00:07:10.340> done<00:07:12.279> yep<00:07:14.379> all<00:07:15.379> right

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:15.529 
you when this is all done yep all right

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:18.010 
you when this is all done yep all right
now<00:07:15.680> finished<00:07:16.159> shrinking<00:07:16.729> both<00:07:17.389> the<00:07:17.629> heat

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
now finished shrinking both the heat

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.179 
now finished shrinking both the heat
shrinks<00:07:18.289> on<00:07:18.439> both<00:07:18.680> sides<00:07:20.650> now<00:07:21.650> the<00:07:21.710> next<00:07:22.099> thing

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:22.189 
shrinks on both sides now the next thing

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:24.240 
shrinks on both sides now the next thing
I'll<00:07:22.370> do<00:07:22.580> is<00:07:22.789> I'll<00:07:22.969> grab<00:07:23.270> my<00:07:23.300> crafts<00:07:23.930> knife

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
I'll do is I'll grab my crafts knife

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.920 
I'll do is I'll grab my crafts knife
craft<00:07:25.250> knife<00:07:25.460> or<00:07:25.729> a<00:07:25.759> Stanley<00:07:26.330> knife<00:07:26.509> and<00:07:26.810> I'll

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
craft knife or a Stanley knife and I'll

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.369 
craft knife or a Stanley knife and I'll
slice<00:07:27.770> the<00:07:28.009> edges<00:07:28.370> straight<00:07:28.879> because<00:07:29.389> it's

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:30.379 
slice the edges straight because it's

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.260 
slice the edges straight because it's
never<00:07:30.590> possible<00:07:30.889> with<00:07:31.340> the<00:07:31.520> effects<00:07:32.150> of

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
never possible with the effects of

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.800 
never possible with the effects of
shrinking<00:07:32.719> to<00:07:32.930> get<00:07:33.560> a<00:07:33.590> straight<00:07:33.949> edge<00:07:34.810> and

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.810 
shrinking to get a straight edge and

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.350 
shrinking to get a straight edge and
then<00:07:36.590> I'll<00:07:36.830> put<00:07:37.219> both<00:07:37.250> the<00:07:37.610> cables<00:07:37.969> into<00:07:38.150> my

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
then I'll put both the cables into my

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.689 
then I'll put both the cables into my
belt<00:07:38.659> and<00:07:38.930> we<00:07:39.919> can<00:07:40.069> see<00:07:40.250> how<00:07:40.370> they<00:07:40.490> look<00:07:42.699> all

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:43.699 
belt and we can see how they look all

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:45.670 
belt and we can see how they look all
right<00:07:43.909> now<00:07:44.120> I've<00:07:44.270> just<00:07:44.300> put<00:07:44.900> the<00:07:45.020> sleeve

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 
right now I've just put the sleeve

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.339 
right now I've just put the sleeve
crossfire<00:07:46.190> cables<00:07:46.610> onto<00:07:46.789> my<00:07:47.029> belt<00:07:47.300> to<00:07:47.509> show

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.349 
crossfire cables onto my belt to show

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:58.059 
now the sleeve here as you can see is
slightly<00:07:56.690> showing<00:07:57.199> the<00:07:57.289> crossfire<00:07:57.680> cable

00:07:58.059 --> 00:07:58.069 
slightly showing the crossfire cable

00:07:58.069 --> 00:07:59.019 
slightly showing the crossfire cable
through<00:07:58.279> it<00:07:58.370> but<00:07:58.460> I<00:07:58.520> still<00:07:58.699> think<00:07:58.909> it<00:07:59.000> looks

00:07:59.019 --> 00:07:59.029 
through it but I still think it looks

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:02.200
