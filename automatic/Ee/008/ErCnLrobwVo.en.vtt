especially in Eagles vision and just
like<00:01:19.619> Assassin's<00:01:20.039> Creed<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.399> into<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.090> music

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
like Assassin's Creed one into the music

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.820 

remember<00:01:37.690> how<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:37.840> said<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.320> kind<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.680> feels

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
remember how I said this kind of feels

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.310 
remember how I said this kind of feels
like<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.070> 2.5<00:01:39.700> sequel<00:01:40.210> while<00:01:40.840> that's<00:01:40.960> mainly

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
like a 2.5 sequel while that's mainly

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.050 
like a 2.5 sequel while that's mainly
because<00:01:41.470> all<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.190> story<00:01:42.520> missions<00:01:42.910> are

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
because all the story missions are

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.850 
because all the story missions are
almost<00:01:43.390> identical<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:44.140> those<00:01:44.290> in<00:01:44.440> assassin's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
almost identical to those in assassin's

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.380 
almost identical to those in assassin's
creed<00:01:45.070> 2<00:01:45.280> yeah<00:01:45.730> there's<00:01:45.970> some<00:01:46.090> different

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
creed 2 yeah there's some different

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.880 
creed 2 yeah there's some different
characters<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:46.960> tweaks<00:01:47.200> here<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.470> there<00:01:47.620> but

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
characters and tweaks here and there but

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.560 
characters and tweaks here and there but
really<00:01:48.370> that<00:01:48.790> part<00:01:49.120> could<00:01:49.270> have<00:01:49.360> been<00:01:49.450> an

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
really that part could have been an

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.480 
really that part could have been an
expansion<00:01:50.140> pack<00:01:50.170> it's<00:01:50.830> not<00:01:51.040> until<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.370> get

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
expansion pack it's not until you get

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.740 
expansion pack it's not until you get
into<00:01:51.610> some<00:01:51.730> of<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.880> side<00:01:52.150> stuff<00:01:52.480> that<00:01:52.660> the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
into some of the side stuff that the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.750 
into some of the side stuff that the
game<00:01:52.900> really<00:01:53.080> opens<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.680> expands<00:01:54.130> up<00:01:54.280> because

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
game really opens and expands up because

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.890 
game really opens and expands up because
for<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.000> most<00:01:55.030> part<00:01:55.360> you'll<00:01:55.570> find<00:01:55.810> yourself

really just don't know there's great
moments<00:05:44.659> sure<00:05:44.840> after<00:05:45.259> you<00:05:45.349> disguise<00:05:45.770> yourself

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
moments sure after you disguise yourself

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.070

and leap on your target from a building
but<00:05:48.470> it<00:05:48.530> can<00:05:48.680> be<00:05:48.800> equally<00:05:49.220> frustrating<00:05:49.909> when

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
but it can be equally frustrating when

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.520 
but it can be equally frustrating when
you're<00:05:50.360> walking<00:05:50.599> through<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.050> streets<00:05:51.199> you

just<00:06:51.380> to<00:06:51.590> see<00:06:51.800> what's<00:06:51.949> at<00:06:52.069> the<00:06:52.159> top<00:06:52.190> of<00:06:52.370> a

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
just to see what's at the top of a

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.519 
just to see what's at the top of a
building<00:06:52.759> and<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:53.389> slightly<00:06:53.690> refined<00:06:54.080> combat

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:54.529 
building and the slightly refined combat

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.800 
building and the slightly refined combat
is<00:06:54.680> super<00:06:55.159> well<00:06:55.370> paced<00:06:55.669> once<00:06:56.449> you're<00:06:56.599> done

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
is super well paced once you're done

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.360 
is super well paced once you're done
with<00:06:56.870> the<00:06:57.080> single-player<00:06:57.440> campaign<00:06:57.949> I<00:06:58.130> do

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
with the single-player campaign I do

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.100 
with the single-player campaign I do
think<00:06:58.729> multiplayer<00:06:59.180> is<00:06:59.270> worth<00:06:59.449> a<00:06:59.569> shot<00:06:59.719> it's

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
think multiplayer is worth a shot it's

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.260 
think multiplayer is worth a shot it's
very<00:07:00.380> distinct<00:07:00.949> and<00:07:01.069> who<00:07:01.250> knows<00:07:01.460> maybe<00:07:01.759> you'll

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
very distinct and who knows maybe you'll

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.730 
very distinct and who knows maybe you'll
get<00:07:02.449> the<00:07:02.539> hang<00:07:02.569> of<00:07:02.810> chaotic<00:07:03.110> killing<00:07:03.620> and

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
get the hang of chaotic killing and

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.090 
get the hang of chaotic killing and
getting<00:07:03.949> killed<00:07:04.159> faster<00:07:04.610> than<00:07:04.729> I<00:07:04.819> did
