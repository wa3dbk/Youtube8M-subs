connected just some light red light red

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.030 
connected just some light red light red
light<00:02:45.850> I'd<00:02:46.850> like<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:49.720> try<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.799> see

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
light I'd like to try to that you see

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:01.089 
light I'd like to try to that you see
our<00:02:52.670> works

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.030 

let's<00:03:01.939> go<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.480> computer<00:03:02.719> I<00:03:05.049> see<00:03:06.049> maybe<00:03:06.500> you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
let's go to the computer I see maybe you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.300 
let's go to the computer I see maybe you
can<00:03:07.340> see<00:03:07.819> okay<00:03:08.450> this<00:03:10.599> is<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.780> address<00:03:12.159> and<00:03:13.159> it

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
can see okay this is the address and it

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.300 
can see okay this is the address and it
will<00:03:13.340> ask<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.810> password<00:03:18.310> okay

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
will ask you for the password okay

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.849 
will ask you for the password okay
perfect

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
perfect

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:29.349 
perfect
you<00:03:21.859> can<00:03:22.040> see<00:03:23.439> that<00:03:24.439> it<00:03:24.620> shows<00:03:26.650> date<00:03:28.359> the

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
you can see that it shows date the

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.830 
you can see that it shows date the
temperature<00:03:30.139> humidity<00:03:32.409> so<00:03:33.409> it's<00:03:33.620> 25<00:03:34.340> degree

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
temperature humidity so it's 25 degree

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.379 
temperature humidity so it's 25 degree
Celsius<00:03:35.840> degree<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:38.260> 55%<00:03:39.639> humidity<00:03:40.639> you

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
Celsius degree and it's 55% humidity you

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:49.750 
Celsius degree and it's 55% humidity you
can<00:03:42.079> see<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:44.950> success<00:03:46.120> relays<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.609> can

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
can see the success relays and you can

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.470 
can see the success relays and you can
choose<00:03:50.030> any<00:03:50.060> name<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.439> race<00:03:51.680> but<00:03:52.069> you<00:03:52.519> can

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
choose any name for the race but you can

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.619 
choose any name for the race but you can
choose<00:03:55.389> one<00:03:56.389> for<00:03:57.139> Asian<00:03:57.889> them<00:03:58.689> okay<00:03:59.689> this<00:04:00.169> is

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
choose one for Asian them okay this is

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:13.089 
choose one for Asian them okay this is
man<00:04:02.629> resettled<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:07.150> if<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:09.159> switch<00:04:10.159> on<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:12.099> don't

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
man resettled so if I switch on I don't

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:24.399 
man resettled so if I switch on I don't
know<00:04:13.310> which<00:04:13.790> one<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:18.909> seem<00:04:20.079> ok<00:04:21.729> yes<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:23.409> don't

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
know which one I seem ok yes I don't

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:30.219 
know which one I seem ok yes I don't
have<00:04:25.960> automatic<00:04:27.849> switching<00:04:28.849> on<00:04:29.240> but<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:30.020> can

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
have automatic switching on but you can

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:41.570 
have automatic switching on but you can
see<00:04:31.599> the<00:04:32.599> power<00:04:32.870> supply<00:04:33.409> and<00:04:33.940> if<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:37.990> switch<00:04:38.990> off

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:50.400 

it<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:43.090> twitching<00:04:43.900> go<00:04:47.370> tarah<00:04:48.370> again<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:50.290> it

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
it is twitching go tarah again and it

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.450 
it is twitching go tarah again and it
turns<00:04:50.680> again<00:04:51.580> on

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:05.610 

okay<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.840> pretty<00:04:59.140> simple<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:04.620> have

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
okay this is pretty simple and you have

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.200 
okay this is pretty simple and you have
a<00:05:05.880> setting<00:05:06.880> page<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:08.380> you<00:05:08.440> can<00:05:08.530> set<00:05:09.210> some

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
a setting page so you can set some

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.400 
a setting page so you can set some
parameters<00:05:11.700> such<00:05:13.230> timers<00:05:15.660> routing<00:05:16.660> time
