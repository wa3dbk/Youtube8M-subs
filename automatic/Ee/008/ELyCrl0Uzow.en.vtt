scuf controllers because there could be

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.430 
scuf controllers because there could be
great<00:03:13.580> people<00:03:14.030> they<00:03:14.180> could<00:03:14.450> be<00:03:14.600> church<00:03:14.959> goers

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
great people they could be church goers

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.100 
great people they could be church goers
and<00:03:15.730> people<00:03:16.730> who<00:03:16.790> do<00:03:16.940> work<00:03:17.120> for<00:03:17.329> charities<00:03:17.810> and

and people who do work for charities and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.960 
and people who do work for charities and
I<00:03:18.290> don't<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.590> taking<00:03:18.890> sick<00:03:19.250> dogs<00:03:19.519> nurture

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
I don't know taking sick dogs nurture

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.449 
I don't know taking sick dogs nurture
them<00:03:20.120> better<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.510> then<00:03:21.200> let<00:03:21.470> them<00:03:21.620> free<00:03:22.070> to

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
them better and then let them free to

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.120 
them better and then let them free to
people<00:03:23.120> who<00:03:23.209> want<00:03:23.420> dogs<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.680> problem<00:03:25.040> I

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
people who want dogs but the problem I

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.030 
people who want dogs but the problem I
have<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.510> broken<00:03:26.989> dynamics<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.769> call

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
have is that the broken dynamics of call

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.039 
have is that the broken dynamics of call
of<00:03:28.070> duty<00:03:28.519> means<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.269> scuf<00:03:29.630> controller

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
of duty means that the scuf controller

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.949 
of duty means that the scuf controller
action<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.829> either<00:03:31.130> jump<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.760> drop<00:03:32.030> means<00:03:32.780> that

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
action I either jump the drop means that

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.900 
action I either jump the drop means that
these<00:03:33.079> players<00:03:33.440> are<00:03:33.530> not<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:34.100> difficult<00:03:34.370> but

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
these players are not just difficult but

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.030 
these players are not just difficult but
almost<00:03:35.180> impossible<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.049> deal<00:03:36.230> with<00:03:36.260> now<00:03:37.010> I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
almost impossible to deal with now I

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.190 
almost impossible to deal with now I
played<00:03:37.549> against<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.000> guy<00:03:38.180> who<00:03:38.600> was<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.750> friend<00:03:39.049> of

played against a guy who was a friend of
mine<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.680> he<00:03:39.739> had<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.220> scuf<00:03:40.519> controller<00:03:40.970> and

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
mine and he had a scuf controller and

mine and he had a scuf controller and
when<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.480> was<00:03:41.630> playing<00:03:41.750> against<00:03:42.109> him<00:03:42.200> he<00:03:42.380> would

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
when I was playing against him he would

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.500 
when I was playing against him he would
drop<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.250> fast<00:03:43.549> it<00:03:43.700> was<00:03:43.760> like<00:03:43.820> some<00:03:44.150> drill

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
drop so fast it was like some drill

drop so fast it was like some drill
sergeant<00:03:45.019> or<00:03:45.170> just<00:03:45.350> screamed<00:03:45.739> in<00:03:45.920> his<00:03:46.040> here<00:03:46.220> to

sergeant or just screamed in his here to
drop<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.760> give<00:03:46.880> him<00:03:47.000> 10<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:47.870> he<00:03:48.140> hit<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.440> deck

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
drop and give him 10 and he hit the deck

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.349 
drop and give him 10 and he hit the deck
with<00:03:48.859> a<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.250> don't<00:03:49.459> know<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.670> help<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.090> gun

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
with a I don't know the help of a gun

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.750 
with a I don't know the help of a gun
but<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.840> back<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.290> head<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:52.459> said

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
but in the back of the head and I said

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.949 
but in the back of the head and I said
how<00:03:52.880> are<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.030> dropping<00:03:53.329> so<00:03:53.600> quick<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:53.930> know

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
how are you dropping so quick you know

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.140 
how are you dropping so quick you know
even<00:03:54.290> when<00:03:54.410> i<00:03:54.440> turn<00:03:54.769> my<00:03:54.920> analog<00:03:55.370> under<00:03:55.760> tactic

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
even when i turn my analog under tactic

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.930 
even when i turn my analog under tactic
on<00:03:56.269> i<00:03:56.329> try<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.660> drop<00:03:56.930> shot<00:03:57.170> there's<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.470> sort<00:03:57.680> of

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
on i try to drop shot there's a sort of

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.430 
on i try to drop shot there's a sort of
transition<00:03:58.940> from<00:03:59.209> sort<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.630> neil's<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.170> drop

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
transition from sort of neil's to drop

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.380 
transition from sort of neil's to drop
and<00:04:00.709> he<00:04:01.400> said<00:04:01.579> it's<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.760> scuff<00:04:02.030> control<00:04:02.359> a

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
and he said it's the scuff control a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.060 
and he said it's the scuff control a
said<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.810> hate<00:04:02.989> it<00:04:03.170> hard<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:03.680> just<00:04:03.859> do<00:04:03.980> an

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
said you hate it hard and you just do an

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.340 
said you hate it hard and you just do an
instant<00:04:04.549> drop<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.000> things<00:04:05.750> like<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.079> jump

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
instant drop and things like the jump

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.990 
instant drop and things like the jump
seat<00:04:06.590> it's<00:04:06.739> almost<00:04:06.950> quicker<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.670> that's<00:04:07.850> what

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
seat it's almost quicker and that's what

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.759 
seat it's almost quicker and that's what
I<00:04:08.030> say<00:04:08.239> it's<00:04:08.390> like<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.690> animation<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.380> jumping

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
I say it's like the animation of jumping

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.740 
I say it's like the animation of jumping
and<00:04:09.920> dropping<00:04:10.280> I<00:04:10.430> find<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.090> these<00:04:11.299> guys<00:04:11.510> who

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
and dropping I find that these guys who

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.900 
and dropping I find that these guys who
use<00:04:11.989> these<00:04:12.230> things<00:04:12.530> there<00:04:13.190> are<00:04:13.489> you<00:04:13.760> know<00:04:13.790> a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
use these things there are you know a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.160 
use these things there are you know a
lot<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.239> time<00:04:14.450> if<00:04:14.570> they<00:04:14.720> jump<00:04:14.989> at<00:04:15.140> you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
lot of the time if they jump at you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.170 
lot of the time if they jump at you
sometimes<00:04:15.470> they<00:04:15.769> do<00:04:15.859> a<00:04:15.890> jump<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.729> drop<00:04:16.970> shot

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
sometimes they do a jump and a drop shot

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.150 
sometimes they do a jump and a drop shot
combined<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:17.930> normally<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.680> find<00:04:18.919> that<00:04:19.010> these

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
combined and normally I find that these

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.190 
combined and normally I find that these
guys<00:04:19.370> jump<00:04:19.760> they<00:04:20.000> shoot<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.510> air<00:04:20.630> they

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
guys jump they shoot in the air they

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.200 
guys jump they shoot in the air they
drop<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.709> then<00:04:21.919> they<00:04:22.099> are<00:04:22.220> off<00:04:22.400> now<00:04:22.460> running

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
drop and then they are off now running

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.700 
drop and then they are off now running
about<00:04:23.479> three<00:04:23.810> meters<00:04:24.140> away<00:04:24.229> from<00:04:24.349> me<00:04:24.560> before

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
about three meters away from me before

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.210 
about three meters away from me before
my<00:04:24.979> body's<00:04:25.310> actually<00:04:25.460> hit<00:04:25.849> the<00:04:25.970> deck

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
my body's actually hit the deck

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.490 
my body's actually hit the deck
that<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.090> frustrating<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.900> as<00:04:28.050> far<00:04:28.230> as<00:04:28.380> I'm

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
that is frustrating and as far as I'm

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.960 
that is frustrating and as far as I'm
concerned<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:29.130> know<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:29.370> is<00:04:29.400> just<00:04:29.760> my<00:04:29.910> own

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
concerned you know this is just my own

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.400 
concerned you know this is just my own
opinion<00:04:30.060> in<00:04:30.510> he'll<00:04:30.690> probably<00:04:30.900> get<00:04:31.080> height

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
opinion in he'll probably get height

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.050 
opinion in he'll probably get height
from<00:04:31.740> across<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.130> board<00:04:32.490> bottom<00:04:32.820> I<00:04:32.910> let's

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
from across the board bottom I let's

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.630 
from across the board bottom I let's
speak<00:04:33.300> my<00:04:33.450> mind<00:04:33.600> he's<00:04:34.290> unfair<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.280> know<00:04:35.430> I

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
speak my mind he's unfair you know I

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.420 
speak my mind he's unfair you know I
don't<00:04:35.970> see<00:04:36.360> how<00:04:36.660> it's<00:04:36.990> feasible<00:04:37.710> for<00:04:38.340> a

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
don't see how it's feasible for a

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.700 
don't see how it's feasible for a
certain<00:04:38.910> population<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.900> people<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.440> think

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
certain population of people to think

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.590 
certain population of people to think
you<00:04:41.070> know<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.250> need<00:04:41.640> this<00:04:41.790> advantage<00:04:42.390> i'm

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
you know I need this advantage i'm

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.750 
you know I need this advantage i'm
probably<00:04:42.990> not<00:04:43.140> a<00:04:43.290> very<00:04:43.350> good<00:04:43.590> player<00:04:43.980> i<00:04:44.250> want

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
probably not a very good player i want

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.190 
probably not a very good player i want
to<00:04:44.820> evade<00:04:45.150> people<00:04:45.570> i<00:04:45.630> want<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.810> be<00:04:45.930> quicker

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
to evade people i want to be quicker

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.780 
to evade people i want to be quicker
than<00:04:46.320> them<00:04:46.590> i'm<00:04:46.830> going<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.100> spend<00:04:47.610> however

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
than them i'm going to spend however

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.210 
than them i'm going to spend however
much<00:04:48.150> money<00:04:48.180> is<00:04:48.570> on<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.750> scuf<00:04:49.080> controller<00:04:49.530> to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
much money is on a scuf controller to

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.190 
much money is on a scuf controller to
have<00:04:50.400> these<00:04:50.550> advantages<00:04:51.240> because<00:04:51.480> like<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.900> say

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
have these advantages because like I say

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.480 
have these advantages because like I say
from<00:04:52.440> what<00:04:52.560> I'm<00:04:52.680> led<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.860> believe<00:04:53.010> from<00:04:53.340> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
from what I'm led to believe from the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.800 
from what I'm led to believe from the
chapel's<00:04:53.880> playing<00:04:54.180> against<00:04:54.480> it<00:04:54.600> does

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
chapel's playing against it does

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.420 
chapel's playing against it does
actually<00:04:55.020> make<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.590> action<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:56.040> lot<00:04:56.190> quicker

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
actually make the action a lot quicker

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.550 
actually make the action a lot quicker
so<00:04:57.270> then<00:04:57.420> I<00:04:57.510> think<00:04:57.720> ik<00:04:57.990> them<00:04:58.170> when<00:04:58.290> I<00:04:58.380> think

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
so then I think ik them when I think

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.160 
so then I think ik them when I think
back<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.860> modern<00:04:59.130> warfare<00:04:59.280> 2<00:04:59.780> you<00:05:00.780> know<00:05:00.900> people

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
back to modern warfare 2 you know people

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.870 
back to modern warfare 2 you know people
would<00:05:01.440> buy<00:05:01.860> these<00:05:02.130> or<00:05:02.370> modify<00:05:02.820> these

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
would buy these or modify these

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.210 
would buy these or modify these
controllers<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:03.900> have<00:05:04.050> rapid<00:05:04.470> fire<00:05:04.680> and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
controllers and have rapid fire and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.800 
controllers and have rapid fire and
you'd<00:05:05.610> find<00:05:05.850> your<00:05:05.940> plane<00:05:06.240> against<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.630> lot<00:05:06.780> of

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
you'd find your plane against a lot of

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.930 
you'd find your plane against a lot of
guys<00:05:07.080> had<00:05:07.350> used<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.680> FAL<00:05:08.220> which<00:05:08.790> was

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
guys had used the FAL which was

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.120 
guys had used the FAL which was
obviously<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.480> most<00:05:09.600> powerful<00:05:10.230> assault

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
obviously the most powerful assault

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.070 
obviously the most powerful assault
rifle<00:05:11.610> in<00:05:11.700> modern<00:05:11.940> warfare<00:05:12.090> 2<00:05:12.420> but<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.990> was

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
rifle in modern warfare 2 but it was

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.840 
rifle in modern warfare 2 but it was
just<00:05:13.290> quite<00:05:13.470> awkward<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.100> sometimes<00:05:14.580> but

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
just quite awkward to you sometimes but

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.850 
just quite awkward to you sometimes but
if<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.120> put<00:05:15.360> him<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.720> know<00:05:15.840> a<00:05:15.870> modified<00:05:16.440> rapid

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
if you put him you know a modified rapid

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.650 
if you put him you know a modified rapid
fire<00:05:17.040> controller<00:05:17.490> with<00:05:17.669> it<00:05:17.790> it<00:05:18.270> became<00:05:18.600> a

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
fire controller with it it became a

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.180 
fire controller with it it became a
death<00:05:18.990> machine<00:05:19.200> there<00:05:19.680> was<00:05:19.830> nothing<00:05:20.160> you

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
death machine there was nothing you

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.000 
death machine there was nothing you
could<00:05:20.460> do<00:05:20.640> against<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.210> was<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:22.410> powerful

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
could do against it was just so powerful

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.460 
could do against it was just so powerful
it<00:05:23.610> made<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.120> famas<00:05:24.540> look<00:05:24.780> like<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.140> just

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
it made the famas look like it just

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.920 
it made the famas look like it just
crawled<00:05:25.620> out<00:05:25.890> a<00:05:25.950> gun<00:05:26.400> kindergarten<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:27.750> what's

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
crawled out a gun kindergarten so what's

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.420 
crawled out a gun kindergarten so what's
the<00:05:28.050> difference<00:05:28.169> with<00:05:28.560> those<00:05:28.800> guys<00:05:29.100> they're

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
the difference with those guys they're

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.970 
the difference with those guys they're
using<00:05:30.030> that<00:05:30.270> controller<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.500> their<00:05:31.680> advantage

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
using that controller to their advantage

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.830 
using that controller to their advantage
by<00:05:32.400> giving<00:05:32.700> them<00:05:32.790> a<00:05:32.880> higher<00:05:33.060> fire<00:05:33.390> right<00:05:33.630> to

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
by giving them a higher fire right to

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840 
by giving them a higher fire right to
the<00:05:33.930> guys<00:05:34.140> who<00:05:34.350> are<00:05:34.530> able<00:05:34.919> to<00:05:35.040> jump<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.580> drop<00:05:35.820> a

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
the guys who are able to jump and drop a

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.640 
the guys who are able to jump and drop a
lot<00:05:36.090> more<00:05:36.210> quicker<00:05:36.510> than<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.290> average<00:05:37.620> Joe

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
lot more quicker than the average Joe

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.100 
lot more quicker than the average Joe
like<00:05:38.070> me<00:05:38.310> uses<00:05:38.730> a<00:05:38.760> normal<00:05:38.970> controller<00:05:39.540> that<00:05:39.930> to

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
like me uses a normal controller that to

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.690 
like me uses a normal controller that to
me<00:05:40.230> as<00:05:40.350> far<00:05:40.530> as<00:05:40.620> I'm<00:05:40.740> concerned<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:41.280> unfair

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
me as far as I'm concerned is unfair

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.280 
me as far as I'm concerned is unfair
it's<00:05:41.970> like<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.150> say<00:05:42.419> it's<00:05:42.540> not<00:05:42.660> necessarily<00:05:43.200> the

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
it's like I say it's not necessarily the

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.260 
it's like I say it's not necessarily the
people<00:05:43.680> that<00:05:43.830> I'm<00:05:43.890> eating<00:05:44.100> on<00:05:44.370> here<00:05:44.580> it's<00:05:45.030> the

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
people that I'm eating on here it's the

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.120 
people that I'm eating on here it's the
way<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:45.600> call<00:05:45.810> of<00:05:45.930> duty<00:05:46.200> works<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.979> one

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
way that call of duty works the one

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.710 
way that call of duty works the one
thing<00:05:47.250> I'll<00:05:47.400> say<00:05:47.430> for<00:05:47.669> battlefield<00:05:48.300> where

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
thing I'll say for battlefield where

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.750 
thing I'll say for battlefield where
it's<00:05:48.870> sort<00:05:49.080> of<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.320> C's<00:05:49.800> call<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.190> duty<00:05:50.460> as<00:05:50.550> far

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
it's sort of a C's call of duty as far

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.850 
it's sort of a C's call of duty as far
as<00:05:50.850> I'm<00:05:50.970> concerned<00:05:51.000> in<00:05:51.630> realism<00:05:52.080> because<00:05:52.740> the

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
as I'm concerned in realism because the

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.440 
as I'm concerned in realism because the
doors<00:05:53.130> strive<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.640> be<00:05:53.729> as<00:05:53.820> realistic<00:05:54.120> as

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
doors strive to be as realistic as

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.630 
doors strive to be as realistic as
possible<00:05:54.540> is<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.800> battlefield<00:05:56.310> when<00:05:56.520> you

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
possible is the in battlefield when you

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.610 
possible is the in battlefield when you
need<00:05:56.820> to<00:05:56.850> drop<00:05:57.210> it<00:05:57.419> you<00:05:57.720> can't<00:05:58.020> shoot<00:05:58.260> as<00:05:58.500> you

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
need to drop it you can't shoot as you

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.800 
need to drop it you can't shoot as you
drop<00:05:58.860> you<00:05:59.130> know<00:05:59.250> you<00:05:59.310> sort<00:05:59.640> of<00:05:59.760> you<00:06:00.300> do<00:06:00.479> is<00:06:00.660> what

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
drop you know you sort of you do is what

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.330 
drop you know you sort of you do is what
you<00:06:00.960> would<00:06:01.080> expect<00:06:01.530> if<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:01.830> was<00:06:01.979> carrying<00:06:02.280> a

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
you would expect if you was carrying a

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.710 
you would expect if you was carrying a
gun<00:06:02.490> in<00:06:02.610> real<00:06:02.760> life<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.180> you<00:06:03.240> wanted<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.570> go

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
gun in real life and you wanted to go

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.120

down to the ground you'd have to sort of
put<00:06:05.310> your<00:06:05.430> arm<00:06:05.580> out<00:06:05.760> lower<00:06:06.030> yourself<00:06:06.450> down<00:06:06.510> you

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.980 
fucking trampolining ballerina it takes
that<00:06:13.919> advantage<00:06:14.280> away<00:06:14.700> from<00:06:14.940> you<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.330> I<00:06:15.720> think

that advantage away from you and I think

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.540 
that advantage away from you and I think
they<00:06:16.110> really<00:06:16.560> need<00:06:16.710> to<00:06:16.740> think<00:06:16.919> about<00:06:17.220> that<00:06:17.490> a

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
they really need to think about that a

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.860 
they really need to think about that a
little<00:06:17.729> bit<00:06:17.820> more<00:06:18.030> in<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.270> future<00:06:18.450> when<00:06:18.750> they

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
little bit more in the future when they

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.300 
little bit more in the future when they
make<00:06:19.020> call<00:06:19.260> of<00:06:19.380> duty's<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.950> other<00:06:20.070> thing

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
make call of duty's the other thing

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.040 
make call of duty's the other thing
about<00:06:20.430> it<00:06:20.700> as<00:06:20.790> well<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:21.479> this<00:06:21.780> is<00:06:21.930> the

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
about it as well and this is the

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.020 
about it as well and this is the
probably<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.890> biggest<00:06:23.220> thing<00:06:23.430> that<00:06:23.550> grinds

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
probably the biggest thing that grinds

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.760 
probably the biggest thing that grinds
my<00:06:24.150> gears<00:06:24.180> and<00:06:24.750> I've<00:06:24.840> talked<00:06:25.110> about<00:06:25.350> this<00:06:25.500> very

the floor as well and that's the one

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.580 
the floor as well and that's the one
