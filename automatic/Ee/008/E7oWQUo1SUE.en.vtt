 apocalypse finally explained part 10 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.410
 the art of serving subscribe and share 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.380
 a great earthquake notice that the verse 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.210
 12 speaks of a great earthquake this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 earthquake happens after the fifth 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 seal after the opening of the sixth seal 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 the terrible time of the fifth seal 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 involves the military invasion and the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 captivity of the peoples of the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.029
 modern nations that are only tribes 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.040
 that have grown up from israel this includes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.829
 the two and a half years of suffering and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.290
 unparalleled tribulation without comparison 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.440
 in history this comes in this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.989
 generation soon by its own time and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.879
 context this earthquake proclaims the end 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.120
 of the tribulation and the beginning of the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.329
 signs that appear in the heavens 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.030
 apocalypse 6 12 says look when he 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.550
 he opened the sixth seal and here he was made a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.770
 great earthquake and the sun went black 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.829
 like a sack of silicon and the moon is 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.940
 it turned all like blood this event 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.400
 he was also covered in matteo 24 29 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.130
 reread it and immediately after 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.410
 of the tribulation of those days the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.780
 sun will darken and the moon will not give its 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.880
 glow and the stars will fall from the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.650
 sky and the powers of the heavens 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 will be moved lucas 21 25 26 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.390
 describe this same event 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.460
 then there will be signs in the sun in the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.980
 moon and in the stars and on the earth 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 anguish of confused people to 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.780
 cause of the roar of the sea and waves 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.970
 tsunamis failing men by 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 the fear and expectation of things 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.900
 that will come on earth because the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.050
 powers of the heavens will be with 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.810
 moved this earthquake will be so terrible 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.690
 that every hill and every island will be shaken 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.310
 and reposition apocalypse 614 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.520
 remember this is the time of the great 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.520
 God's wrath this earthquake will be global 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.530
 in its scope but the topography of all 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.290
 the earth will not necessarily be 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.110
 changed by a final earthquake this 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.450
 process seems to take place in stages 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.640
 God will make it happen in such a way that 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.610
 preserve life on earth with every 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.720
 one of the five final earthquakes 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.180
 contributing in some aspect of the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.730
 transformation if only an earthquake 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.760
 catastrophic do this could it 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.890
 threaten all life on earth 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.870
 still just one tenth of the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.200
 humanity will survive until the millennium 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.230
 again this earthquake announces the sixth 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.420
 seal the celestial signs notice the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.910
 Isaiah description of this time 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.190
 that day will throw the man to the moles 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.290
 and bat their silver idols and their 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.720
 idols of gold that made him so that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.880
 adore and will get into the crevices of 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.520
 the rocks and in the caves of the rocks 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.010
 by the formidable presence of the eternal and 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.620
 by the radiance of his majesty when 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:05.550
 rise up to punish the earth 22021 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:10.860
 this is comparable apocalypse 6 15 16 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.900
 all apocalypse 6 14 17 shows that 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.810
 this sign represents the heavens 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.860
 rolling together like a roll this 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.990
 time will be both 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.570
 Juan registers people 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.970
 terrified hiding in caverns 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.880
 and rocks and claiming death the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.490
 verse 17 question and who may 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.650
 stand up the masses fear 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.230
 face the complete wrath of the only 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.650
 who have disobeyed three events 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.860
 world understand the tribulation and the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.350
 Day of the Lord are not synonymous these are 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.100
 completely different events 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.920
 separated 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.320
 the heavenly signs come in between 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.470
 of the preceding tribulation and the day 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:57.989
 Mr. that follows if only matthew 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:00.480
 24 21 29 and apocalypse 7 14 use the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.209
 great tribulation term at least 30 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.400
 writings speak of her the leaders 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.650
 religious of this world are in 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.870
 almost complete ignorance of how they will come 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.840
 these three great events that will shake 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.900
 the earth in what order the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.320
 most believe that these are synonyms not 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.470
 what are the tribulation comes first and 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.520
 immediately after the tribulation 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.699
 registration christ comes 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.610
 the celestial signs these introduce 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.550
 the day of the Lord the wrath of God which 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.340
 it is a separate period of events we have 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.650
 seen as joel sophonias and mateo have 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.319
 explained what Christ revealed to him in 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.960
 vision to john in the revelation for 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.629
 now these big events should be 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.810
 clear Christ also taught his 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.930
 disciples in vain honor me by teaching 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.030
 as doctrines commandments of men 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.979
 because leaving the commandment of God 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:01.250
 you cling to the tradition of men 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:04.110
 778 frames there are many points of view 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.569
 traditional but incorrect 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.699
 prophecy more and more people are 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.580
 writing about prophecies of the 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.979
 which they know nothing they ignore what 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.409
 God says in order to promote theories 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.800
 empty consecrated by time or even 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.840
 newer and exaggerated new ideas , 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.090
 I just reviewed an article in a 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.919
 national magazine about a lot that has been 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.380
 covered so far in this 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.030
 this brochure shows an ignorance 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.620
 frightening even of the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.750
 most basic of scriptures 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.020
 belonging to the prophecies of 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.760
 end time notwithstanding the article 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.750
 shows that almost three out of five 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.120
 American people 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.040
 scores of millions believe that the 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.350
 mixed confusion of ideas to which 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.600
 refers apocalypse soon will 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.420
 will come true but only somehow 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.880
 unexplainable and mysterious millions of 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.160
 other christian processes no doubt 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.740
 because either they do not care or they're 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.050
 confused reject anything that 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.600
 have to do with the prophecy of 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.270
 any way people stay 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.490
 ignorant most people 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.440
 they believe that the tribulation signals 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.590
 celestial and the day of the Lord are 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.480
 identical that they are one and the same nobody 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.090
 I can not distinguish between these 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.770
 separate events has any hope 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.220
 to understand what God has prophesied 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.160
 here is an important distinction the day 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.110
 of the Lord reflects the wrath of God the 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.200
 tribulation is actually the wrath of 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.030
 satan the devil this fallen angel knows 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.010
 well he has little time left for 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.550
 remain as the god of this world 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.660
 Second Corinthians 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:46.440
 44 deceiving the nations apocalypse 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:48.390
 12 9 your time has almost finished the 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.180
 tribulation is also the persecution 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.520
 end of satan and the martyrdom of many 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.400
 of the true servants of God who 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.980
 they are in a warm condition if they 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.410
 they remain near god satan no 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.100
 can cheat them and that's why he's furious 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.450
 if you look for god you do not need 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.520
 worry about the events that 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.610
 soon they are going to hit all the 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:15.210
 nations take a moment to read lucas 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.310
 21 36 this is a promise 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.950
 reassuring on behalf of Christ that 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.200
 he demands of you to watch and pray that you are 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.630
 considered worthy to escape all 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.180
 these things and to stand in front 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.040
 of the son of man read then the 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.290
 Sober description of Christ the 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.270
 previous verses of how those events 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.030
 will strike like a bow to a world 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.070
 completely unprepared the goal of a 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.380
 Christian is standing in front of 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.289
 Christ on his return and rule with him 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:48.259
 when the kingdom of God is established 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:48.259
 see you in the next video part 11
