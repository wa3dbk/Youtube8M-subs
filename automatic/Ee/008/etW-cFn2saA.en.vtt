00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the g2 is that it uses 32 nanometer NAND

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.869 
the g2 is that it uses 32 nanometer NAND
flash<00:02:09.780> memory<00:02:10.129> which<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.310> very<00:02:11.520> small<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
flash memory which is very small and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.430 
flash memory which is very small and
very<00:02:12.090> fast<00:02:12.510> memory<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
very fast memory but it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 
very fast memory but it
also<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.770> very<00:02:13.950> short<00:02:14.280> supply<00:02:14.310> right<00:02:14.850> now

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
also in very short supply right now

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.270 
also in very short supply right now
