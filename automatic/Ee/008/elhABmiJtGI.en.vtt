00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
what does getting down the first step in

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.369 
what does getting down the first step in
the<00:03:59.209> glitch<00:03:59.420> have<00:03:59.629> anything<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.109> do<00:04:00.200> with<00:04:00.230> the

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
the glitch have anything to do with the

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.339 
the glitch have anything to do with the
Duchy<00:04:00.560> at<00:04:00.709> all<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:02.269> this<00:04:02.390> way<00:04:02.629> if<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:03.230> don't
