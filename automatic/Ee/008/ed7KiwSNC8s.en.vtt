00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.549
 Hello everyone, Andrei Andreevich 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:08.189
 Andreev my site all-all point ru 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.130
 1440 first problem solve equation 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.790
 I decide only under the letter b well under the letters 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:20.400
 ices need to be solved exactly the same way let's 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:26.490
 to understand we have terms which 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 with the game and there are those without y and then 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.949
 There are those who are the alphabet and those who are with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.710
 letter so here are those that with the letter can 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.780
 add or subtract 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 which we can add without a letter or 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.430
 subtract between each other let's 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.289
 calculate 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.780
 we have 80 point one tenth y minus 10 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:57.809
 point one will turn out as y 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 read subtract from the igryku one 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:06.890
 minus 10, comma 0 minus zero zero 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.170
 eight minus one this 7 turns 70 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 what if we subtract we get 70 toys 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:22.110
 plus 4 more , 7 equals 81, 7 not add up 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.970
 We can because this is with the letter and this is without 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.229
 the letter on the addend cannot be folded 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.460
 then that's what we do 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.829
 term sum to find one of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.979
 terms need to be subtracted from the amount 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.750
 another term but from this it is already 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.820
 we can deduct because here too 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.990
 number 10 and here and here is the usual number 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:57.329
 both numbers without as they say without letters 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:01.320
 without glare 81, 7 minus 4, 7 7 minus 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:06.869
 70 , we can not subtract a comma from 1 4 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.780
 take out of 11 subtract 4 is seven of 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:16.290
 Eight occupied 7 left 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:22.170
 it turns out 7777 integers on the right and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 70 y on the left 70 y is 70 multiplied by 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.670
 y if the number is then literally what 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.489
 multiply 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.560
 multiplier multiplier of the product as 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.959
 find one of the multipliers you need 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.690
 composition 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:42.840
 divide by another factor 77 divide 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.850
 by seventy seventy seven 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:54.480
 divide by 70 take one one by 70 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:59.610
 that's 70 subtracts we get 77 by 70 not 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.430
 share put a comma and append here 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.260
 here 0 when we put a comma we 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.489
 start using the first digit after 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.560
 we have a comma here 77, at the end and then 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.959
 go an infinite number of zeros we them 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.519
 just don't write when we put a comma 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.100
 we start using the first digit 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.560
 after comma it is 0 that is we add 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:27.530
 here 0 and take again one by one 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:35.700
 one by 70 this is 70 it turns out 1.1 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:39.120
 y is 1.1 this we had the letter b but 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.840
 the letter a is exactly the same on it all 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.840
 until
