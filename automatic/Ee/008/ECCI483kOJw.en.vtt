hey there fit fam Michael here I'm early
fit<00:00:07.259> comm<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.610> video<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.150> want<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.599> talk

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
fit comm in this video I want to talk

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.990 
fit comm in this video I want to talk
about<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.410> absolute<00:00:10.620> number<00:00:11.550> one<00:00:11.730> way<00:00:11.940> to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
about the absolute number one way to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.980 
about the absolute number one way to
burn<00:00:12.599> fat<00:00:12.630> above<00:00:13.469> all<00:00:13.710> else<00:00:14.299> before<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.509> tell

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
burn fat above all else before I tell

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.330 
burn fat above all else before I tell
you<00:00:16.020> before<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:16.740> there<00:00:17.010> we've<00:00:17.190> got<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you before we get there we've got a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.470 
you before we get there we've got a
little<00:00:17.520> bit<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.670> ground<00:00:17.850> work<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> want

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
little bit of ground work to do I want

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.140 
little bit of ground work to do I want
to<00:00:18.539> talk<00:00:18.690> about<00:00:18.980> calories<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.310> want<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.970> talk

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to talk about calories I want to talk

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.960 
to talk about calories I want to talk
about<00:00:21.710> how<00:00:22.710> your<00:00:22.949> body<00:00:23.160> burns<00:00:23.490> these<00:00:23.670> calories

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
about how your body burns these calories

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.080 
about how your body burns these calories
and<00:00:24.570> essentially<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.650> loss<00:00:25.830> or

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
and essentially you know the loss or

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.519 
and essentially you know the loss or
thermodynamics<00:00:27.090> says<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:28.019> calories

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
thermodynamics says that you calories

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.710 
thermodynamics says that you calories
energy<00:00:29.400> cannot<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.880> destroyed<00:00:30.300> only

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
energy cannot be destroyed only

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.049 
energy cannot be destroyed only
transferred<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.650> at<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> end<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> day<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
transferred so at the end of the day it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.120 
transferred so at the end of the day it
is<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.480> calories<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.590> calories<00:00:34.620> out

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
is about calories in and calories out

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.240 
is about calories in and calories out
now<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:36.239> say<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> don't<00:00:36.780> believe<00:00:37.250> all

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
now I will say that I don't believe all

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
now I will say that I don't believe all
foods<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.180> created<00:00:39.390> equal<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.930> don't<00:00:40.079> believe

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
foods are created equal I don't believe

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
foods are created equal I don't believe
that<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.730> eat<00:00:41.879> McDonald's<00:00:42.420> all<00:00:42.540> day

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that you can just eat McDonald's all day

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
that you can just eat McDonald's all day
versus<00:00:43.440> Whole<00:00:43.680> Foods<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.070> you're<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
versus Whole Foods and you're going to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.889 
versus Whole Foods and you're going to
get<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> same<00:00:44.789> results<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.420> some<00:00:45.600> people<00:00:45.809> do

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
get the same results but some people do

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
get the same results but some people do
believe<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:47.550> quickly<00:00:47.760> let's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
believe that so really quickly let's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.150 
believe that so really quickly let's
talk<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.739> calories<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.950> use<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
talk about calories I'm gonna use the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.920 
talk about calories I'm gonna use the
pie<00:00:50.340> chart<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.480> let's<00:00:51.690> pretend

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
pie chart all right so let's pretend

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
pie chart all right so let's pretend
these<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> calories<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:54.000> body

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
these are the calories that your body

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
these are the calories that your body
burns<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> day<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.520> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
burns in a day all right so this is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.029 
burns in a day all right so this is
actually<00:00:57.059> broken<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.480> into<00:00:57.750> let<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.890> how

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
actually broken up into let me see how

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
actually broken up into let me see how
I'm<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.730> test<00:01:00.239> my<00:01:00.420> drawing

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
I'm gonna do this and test my drawing

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.889 
I'm gonna do this and test my drawing
skills<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.379> we've<00:01:01.980> got<00:01:02.250> about<00:01:02.629> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.750> going

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
skills so we've got about this is going

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.670 
skills so we've got about this is going
to<00:01:03.960> represent<00:01:05.810> 60<00:01:07.729> to<00:01:08.729> 70<00:01:09.119> percent<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.840> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to represent 60 to 70 percent and this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.490 
to represent 60 to 70 percent and this
is<00:01:10.860> rmr<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.720> resting

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
is rmr all right so this is resting

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100 
is rmr all right so this is resting
metabolic<00:01:14.159> rate<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:15.330> some<00:01:15.630> people<00:01:15.840> say

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
metabolic rate also some people say

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.020 
metabolic rate also some people say
basal<00:01:16.920> metabolic<00:01:17.040> rate<00:01:17.400> essentially<00:01:17.820> what

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
basal metabolic rate essentially what

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.310 
basal metabolic rate essentially what
this<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> amount<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
this is is these are the amount of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.219 
this is is these are the amount of
calories<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.670> body<00:01:20.909> burns<00:01:21.299> while<00:01:22.020> at

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
calories that your body burns while at

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.929 
calories that your body burns while at
rest<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:22.680> sleeping<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.159> essentially<00:01:23.759> you're

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
rest not sleeping so essentially you're

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
rest not sleeping so essentially you're
all<00:01:24.030> you're<00:01:24.180> moving<00:01:24.540> around<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.229> you're

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
all you're moving around and you're

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.929 
all you're moving around and you're
going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> kitchen<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:26.670> doing

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
going to the kitchen and you're doing

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.399 
going to the kitchen and you're doing
this<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.450> you're<00:01:27.570> getting<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> bed<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this or you're getting out of bed and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
this or you're getting out of bed and
your<00:01:28.500> abdominals<00:01:29.009> contract<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
your abdominals contract this is all the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.609 
your abdominals contract this is all the
movement<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.049> muscles<00:01:31.439> throughout

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
movement from your muscles throughout

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.679 
movement from your muscles throughout
the<00:01:31.740> day<00:01:31.860> 60<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.790> 70<00:01:33.240> percent<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.630> your

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the day 60 to 70 percent of your

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.870 
the day 60 to 70 percent of your
calories<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.409> burned<00:01:35.040> during<00:01:35.640> those

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
calories are burned during those

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.569 
calories are burned during those
activities<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:37.259> you've<00:01:37.439> got<00:01:37.619> another

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.910 

twenty<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.939> thirty<00:01:42.329> percent<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:43.020> burned

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
twenty to thirty percent is burned

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.190 
twenty to thirty percent is burned
through<00:01:44.189> exercise<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> exercise<00:01:45.450> now

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
through exercise if you exercise now

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.160 
through exercise if you exercise now
some<00:01:46.860> people<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.159> set<00:01:47.340> entry<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.570> this

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
some people are set entry and so this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.499 
some people are set entry and so this
piece<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.619> even<00:01:49.860> smaller<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.939> idea<00:01:51.240> here

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
piece is even smaller but the idea here

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.030 
piece is even smaller but the idea here
is<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.930> twenty<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.290> thirty<00:01:52.560> percent<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
is is that twenty to thirty percent of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.700 
is is that twenty to thirty percent of
your<00:01:53.479> calories<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.899> burned<00:01:55.200> through

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
your calories are burned through

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
your calories are burned through
exercise<00:01:56.159> whether<00:01:56.460> you're<00:01:56.670> weightlifting<00:01:57.149> or

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
exercise whether you're weightlifting or

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.760 
exercise whether you're weightlifting or
you're<00:01:57.420> doing<00:01:57.540> high-intensity<00:01:58.409> interval

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you're doing high-intensity interval

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
you're doing high-intensity interval
training<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.579> some<00:02:00.090> other<00:02:00.240> form<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.570> activity

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
training or some other form of activity

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.800 
training or some other form of activity
and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> last<00:02:02.670> No<00:02:03.600> 10<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.560> 15<00:02:05.040> percent<00:02:05.549> is

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
and then the last No 10 to 15 percent is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.279 
and then the last No 10 to 15 percent is
the<00:02:06.810> digestion<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:08.030> food<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.840> body<00:02:09.869> actually

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the digestion of food your body actually

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.900 
the digestion of food your body actually
burns<00:02:10.679> calories<00:02:10.950> through<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> digestion

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
burns calories through the digestion

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.130 
burns calories through the digestion
process

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
process

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.720 
process
in<00:02:13.200> fact<00:02:13.500> 10<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.430> 15%<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:15.240> them<00:02:15.390> come<00:02:16.380> from<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
in fact 10 to 15% of them come from the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.309 
in fact 10 to 15% of them come from the
digestion<00:02:18.120> process<00:02:18.209> it's<00:02:18.630> also<00:02:18.750> called<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
digestion process it's also called the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.760 
digestion process it's also called the
thermic<00:02:19.740> effect<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.490> food<00:02:20.550> now<00:02:21.770> something

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
thermic effect of food now something

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.130 
thermic effect of food now something
really<00:02:22.980> something<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.630> just<00:02:24.630> mention<00:02:24.959> here<00:02:24.990> is

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
really something to just mention here is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.260 
really something to just mention here is
worth<00:02:25.260> mentioning<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.950> protein<00:02:26.730> has<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
worth mentioning is that protein has the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.870 
worth mentioning is that protein has the
highest<00:02:27.690> thermic<00:02:28.410> effect<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.860> food<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.459> it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
highest thermic effect of food so it

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.030 
highest thermic effect of food so it
takes<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.300> body<00:02:30.450> more<00:02:30.780> energy<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.830> break

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
takes your body more energy to break

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
takes your body more energy to break
down<00:02:32.340> protein<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.990> number<00:02:34.170> is

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
down protein and so this number is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.070 
down protein and so this number is
actually<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.850> actually<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.270> go<00:02:36.390> up<00:02:36.630> based

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
actually it can actually can go up based

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.050 
actually it can actually can go up based
on<00:02:37.350> what<00:02:37.740> you're<00:02:38.580> eating<00:02:38.700> or<00:02:38.940> what

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
on what you're eating or what

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.310 
on what you're eating or what
macronutrient<00:02:39.660> you're<00:02:39.750> eating<00:02:39.959> alright<00:02:40.170> so

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
macronutrient you're eating alright so

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.210 
macronutrient you're eating alright so
these<00:02:41.160> represent<00:02:42.650> 100%<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.709> your<00:02:43.770> calories

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
these represent 100% of your calories

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.520 
these represent 100% of your calories
that<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.819> burn<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.120> any<00:02:45.450> given<00:02:45.750> day<00:02:45.870> all<00:02:46.350> right

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that you burn in any given day all right

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.390 
that you burn in any given day all right
we<00:02:46.920> know<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.570> 3500<00:02:48.570> calories<00:02:49.190> equals<00:02:50.190> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
we know that 3500 calories equals a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.020 
we know that 3500 calories equals a
pound<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.790> fat<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:52.050> essentially<00:02:52.650> what<00:02:53.550> fat<00:02:53.820> is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
pound of fat and essentially what fat is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.820 
pound of fat and essentially what fat is
is<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.660> extra<00:02:55.110> energy<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.620> just

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
is it's just extra energy it's just

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.449 
is it's just extra energy it's just
stored<00:02:56.160> energy<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:56.790> body<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.459> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
stored energy on your body and so the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.550 
stored energy on your body and so the
moral<00:02:59.910> or<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.300> whole<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.870> whole<00:03:00.900> takeaway

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
moral or the whole the whole takeaway

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560 
moral or the whole the whole takeaway
from<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.890> video<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.519> as<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.180> mentioned<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
from this video is as I mentioned the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.080 
from this video is as I mentioned the
number<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.110> way<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.380> burn<00:03:04.739> fat<00:03:04.940> above<00:03:05.940> all

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
number one way to burn fat above all

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.570 
number one way to burn fat above all
else<00:03:06.300> if<00:03:06.570> we're<00:03:07.019> burning<00:03:07.350> sixty<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.250> seventy

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
else if we're burning sixty to seventy

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.280 
else if we're burning sixty to seventy
percent<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.940> our<00:03:09.000> calories<00:03:09.290> resting

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
percent of our calories resting

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.790 
percent of our calories resting
metabolic<00:03:10.709> rate<00:03:11.130> well<00:03:12.030> wouldn't<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.420> be

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
metabolic rate well wouldn't it be

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.020 
metabolic rate well wouldn't it be
wouldn't<00:03:13.800> be<00:03:13.860> smart<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.220> take<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.430> look<00:03:14.760> at<00:03:14.880> this

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
wouldn't be smart to take a look at this

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.509 
wouldn't be smart to take a look at this
and<00:03:15.209> say<00:03:15.300> okay<00:03:15.420> well<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:16.019> we're<00:03:16.800> burning<00:03:17.130> most

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
and say okay well if we're burning most

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.110 
and say okay well if we're burning most
of<00:03:17.670> our<00:03:17.760> calories<00:03:18.239> here<00:03:18.630> how<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.940> get<00:03:20.940> our

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
of our calories here how do we get our

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.830 
of our calories here how do we get our
rmr<00:03:21.750> up<00:03:22.620> how<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.610> increase<00:03:23.970> our<00:03:24.180> rmr<00:03:24.630> so

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
rmr up how do we increase our rmr so

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.490 
rmr up how do we increase our rmr so
that<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.110> number<00:03:25.579> becomes<00:03:26.579> larger<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that this number becomes larger and the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.310 
that this number becomes larger and the
short<00:03:28.950> answer<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.670> muscle<00:03:30.390> more

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
short answer to that is muscle more

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.720 
short answer to that is muscle more
muscle<00:03:31.650> increase<00:03:32.549> muscle<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:35.100> more<00:03:35.280> muscle

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
muscle increase muscle the more muscle

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.630 
muscle increase muscle the more muscle
on<00:03:35.820> your<00:03:36.000> body<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:37.079> higher<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.680> RMR<00:03:38.130> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
on your body the higher your RMR the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.060 
on your body the higher your RMR the
more<00:03:38.850> calories<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.540> burn<00:03:39.750> at<00:03:39.900> rest<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.470> so

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
more calories you burn at rest and so

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.949 
more calories you burn at rest and so
that's<00:03:41.340> why<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.390> go<00:03:42.540> back<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.870> you

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
that's why when if you go back and you

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:43.880 
that's why when if you go back and you
look<00:03:43.079> at<00:03:43.140> some<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.380> my<00:03:43.410> videos<00:03:43.709> on<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.860> channel

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
look at some of my videos on the channel

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.699 
look at some of my videos on the channel
i'm<00:03:44.340> always<00:03:45.180> talking<00:03:45.480> about<00:03:45.780> build<00:03:46.290> muscle

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709

not going to get big and bulky overnight
you<00:03:50.850> have<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.420> build<00:03:51.720> muscle<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.500> order<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.010> set

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
you have to build muscle in order to set

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.520
