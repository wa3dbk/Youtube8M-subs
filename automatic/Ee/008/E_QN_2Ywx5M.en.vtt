00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
at the glossy mirrors because I've seen

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.189 
at the glossy mirrors because I've seen
a<00:05:03.849> few<00:05:03.910> people<00:05:04.360> go<00:05:04.539> on<00:05:04.720> about<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
a few people go on about the

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.960 
a few people go on about the
Philosopher's<00:05:05.680> um<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:08.110> coral<00:05:09.099> reef<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.729> this

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
Philosopher's um the coral reef and this

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.770 
Philosopher's um the coral reef and this
is<00:05:10.150> exactly<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.740> little<00:05:12.159> darker<00:05:12.639> but<00:05:12.880> I

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
is exactly this is a little darker but I

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.480 
is exactly this is a little darker but I
like<00:05:14.050> this<00:05:14.199> formula<00:05:14.860> because<00:05:15.159> it<00:05:15.280> goes<00:05:15.460> on

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
like this formula because it goes on

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.460 
like this formula because it goes on
very<00:05:16.060> very<00:05:16.330> smooth<00:05:16.599> it<00:05:16.750> reminds<00:05:17.139> me<00:05:17.289> of<00:05:17.380> the

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
very very smooth it reminds me of the

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.189 
very very smooth it reminds me of the
estee<00:05:17.770> lauder<00:05:18.009> lip<00:05:18.310> gloss<00:05:18.520> actually<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:20.020> of

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
estee lauder lip gloss actually so of

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.570 
estee lauder lip gloss actually so of
course<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.530> think<00:05:20.710> this<00:05:20.800> might<00:05:20.860> be<00:05:21.039> a<00:05:21.190> little

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
course I think this might be a little

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.640 
course I think this might be a little
more<00:05:22.120> expensive<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.860> i<00:05:23.949> will<00:05:24.130> swatch<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:25.650> yeah

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
more expensive and i will swatch it yeah

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.120 
more expensive and i will swatch it yeah
this<00:05:26.919> is<00:05:27.099> pretty<00:05:27.310> it's<00:05:28.060> definitely<00:05:28.240> more<00:05:28.720> of<00:05:28.780> a
