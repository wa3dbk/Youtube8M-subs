we'd<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.959> be<00:03:05.200> using<00:03:05.680> fish<00:03:06.100> waste<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.910> feed

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
we'd like to be using fish waste to feed

we'd like to be using fish waste to feed
our<00:03:07.480> leaf<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.079> herb<00:03:08.230> crops<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.610> here<00:03:09.880> we

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
our leaf and herb crops so in here we

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.850 
our leaf and herb crops so in here we
are<00:03:10.239> growing<00:03:10.450> tilapia<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.290> can<00:03:11.440> see<00:03:11.620> some<00:03:11.829> of

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
are growing tilapia you can see some of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.800 
are growing tilapia you can see some of
these<00:03:12.010> fish<00:03:12.310> right<00:03:12.579> here<00:03:12.610> these<00:03:13.180> fish<00:03:13.540> then

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
these fish right here these fish then

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.590 
these fish right here these fish then
produce<00:03:14.170> waste<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:15.459> then<00:03:15.760> feed<00:03:16.299> these

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
produce waste that then feed these

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.390 
produce waste that then feed these
plants<00:03:17.110> but<00:03:17.410> based<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.799> what<00:03:17.980> we<00:03:18.070> learned<00:03:18.310> here

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
plants but based on what we learned here

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.069 
plants but based on what we learned here
we'll<00:03:18.730> increase<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.209> number<00:03:19.570> of<00:03:19.660> fish<00:03:19.840> and

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
we'll increase the number of fish and

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.310 
we'll increase the number of fish and
then<00:03:20.760> eventually<00:03:21.760> connect<00:03:22.329> this<00:03:22.660> fish<00:03:23.110> tank

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
then eventually connect this fish tank

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.710 
then eventually connect this fish tank
to<00:03:23.920> one<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.250> our<00:03:24.340> larger<00:03:24.730> entity<00:03:25.150> systems<00:03:25.600> so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
to one of our larger entity systems so

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.600 
to one of our larger entity systems so
they<00:03:25.900> can<00:03:26.049> be<00:03:26.200> one<00:03:26.410> closed<00:03:26.739> cycle<00:03:27.010> any

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
they can be one closed cycle any

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.460 
they can be one closed cycle any
material<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.630> we<00:03:28.690> have<00:03:28.810> left<00:03:29.019> over<00:03:29.230> from<00:03:29.350> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
material that we have left over from the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.710 
material that we have left over from the
plants<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:29.890> we<00:03:30.130> compost<00:03:30.850> all<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.510> then

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
plants that we compost all that and then

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.870 
plants that we compost all that and then
harvest<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.350> worms<00:03:32.620> out<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.280> feed<00:03:33.670> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
harvest the worms out of that feed the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.180 
harvest the worms out of that feed the
worms<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.630> fish<00:03:34.930> which<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.680> actually<00:03:35.980> kind

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
worms to the fish which is actually kind

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.680 
worms to the fish which is actually kind
of<00:03:36.280> fun<00:03:36.430> we<00:03:36.610> have<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:36.880> little<00:03:37.060> worm<00:03:37.360> raft

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
of fun we have this little worm raft

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.240 
of fun we have this little worm raft
that<00:03:38.019> we<00:03:38.170> do<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:38.799> we'll<00:03:38.920> just<00:03:39.070> put<00:03:39.190> a

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
that we do it with so we'll just put a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.920 
that we do it with so we'll just put a
pile<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.790> compost<00:03:40.269> with<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.510> worms<00:03:40.720> on

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
pile of the compost with the worms on

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.289 
pile of the compost with the worms on
here<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.500> then<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.160> worms<00:03:42.370> are<00:03:42.610> looking<00:03:42.970> for

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
here and then the worms are looking for

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.050 
here and then the worms are looking for
water<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:45.010> they'll<00:03:45.190> go<00:03:45.640> through<00:03:45.940> these

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
water and so they'll go through these

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.970 
water and so they'll go through these
holes<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.570> dangle<00:03:47.079> themselves<00:03:47.590> underneath

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
holes and dangle themselves underneath

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.710 
holes and dangle themselves underneath
and<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.370> pretty<00:03:48.910> exciting<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.360> fish<00:03:49.540> just

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
and it's pretty exciting the fish just

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.229 
and it's pretty exciting the fish just
come<00:03:50.019> out<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.410> snatch<00:03:51.400> them<00:03:51.670> really<00:03:51.940> quickly

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
come out and snatch them really quickly

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.880 
come out and snatch them really quickly
they're<00:03:52.540> probably<00:03:52.810> excited<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.380> by<00:03:53.530> not

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
they're probably excited just by not

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.160 
they're probably excited just by not
seeing<00:03:54.130> this<00:03:54.310> worm<00:03:54.489> wrap<00:03:54.940> get<00:03:55.180> picked<00:03:55.450> up

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
seeing this worm wrap get picked up

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.080 
seeing this worm wrap get picked up
we<00:03:57.170> have<00:03:57.680> other<00:03:57.920> kind<00:03:58.189> of<00:03:58.250> hydroponic<00:03:58.760> systems

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
we have other kind of hydroponic systems

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.750 
we have other kind of hydroponic systems
one<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.510> which<00:03:59.689> is<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.319> Dutch<00:04:00.980> bucket<00:04:01.519> system

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
one of which is a Dutch bucket system

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.750 
one of which is a Dutch bucket system
and<00:04:02.329> we<00:04:02.810> can<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.379> tomatoes<00:04:04.069> growing<00:04:04.459> in

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
and we can see the tomatoes growing in

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.209 
and we can see the tomatoes growing in
that<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.239> what<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:05.510> have<00:04:05.719> is<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.290> reservoir<00:04:06.950> like

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
that so what we have is a reservoir like

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.039 
that so what we have is a reservoir like
all<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.579> ours<00:04:07.730> they're<00:04:07.939> all<00:04:08.120> recirculating

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
all of ours they're all recirculating

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.890 
all of ours they're all recirculating
hydroponic<00:04:09.439> systems<00:04:09.980> we<00:04:10.579> capture<00:04:11.480> all<00:04:11.719> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
hydroponic systems we capture all the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.569 
hydroponic systems we capture all the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
water it drains back into here and we

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.370 
water it drains back into here and we
reuse<00:04:13.939> it<00:04:15.519> we're<00:04:16.519> on<00:04:16.549> our<00:04:16.729> third<00:04:17.389> cucumber

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
reuse it we're on our third cucumber

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.219 
reuse it we're on our third cucumber
crop<00:04:18.650> here<00:04:19.009> and<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:20.120> can<00:04:20.299> see<00:04:20.509> these<00:04:20.660> are<00:04:20.930> just

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
crop here and you can see these are just

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.740 
crop here and you can see these are just
starting<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.709> set<00:04:22.070> their<00:04:22.280> first<00:04:22.580> fruits<00:04:23.030> now

starting to set their first fruits now
the<00:04:23.810> high<00:04:24.050> productivity<00:04:24.620> we<00:04:24.949> see<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.490> our

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
the high productivity we see and our

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.330 
the high productivity we see and our
plants<00:04:26.360> being<00:04:26.539> so<00:04:26.810> healthy<00:04:27.289> are<00:04:27.470> because<00:04:28.190> of

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
plants being so healthy are because of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.159 
plants being so healthy are because of
how<00:04:28.520> we<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.880> manage<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.419> nutrition<00:04:29.960> and

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
how we can manage the nutrition and

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.719 
how we can manage the nutrition and
that's<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.500> real<00:04:30.680> advantage<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:31.550> using

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
that's the real advantage of using

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.060 
that's the real advantage of using
hydroponics<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.990> being<00:04:33.440> able<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.710> control

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
hydroponics is being able to control

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.279 
hydroponics is being able to control
exactly<00:04:34.460> how<00:04:34.729> much<00:04:35.030> nitrogen<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.780> calcium

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
and magnesium how how much you have all

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.060 
and magnesium how how much you have all
these<00:04:38.690> elements<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.470> plant<00:04:39.740> needs<00:04:39.919> to

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
these elements that a plant needs to

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.730 
these elements that a plant needs to
grow<00:04:40.190> why<00:04:40.849> we<00:04:41.210> are<00:04:41.449> so<00:04:41.750> productive<00:04:42.080> per<00:04:42.440> square

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
grow why we are so productive per square

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.010 
grow why we are so productive per square
foot<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.130> use<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.550> vertical<00:04:43.970> space<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.599> lot

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
foot is the use of vertical space a lot

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.719 
foot is the use of vertical space a lot
of<00:04:45.139> times<00:04:45.349> you<00:04:45.560> see<00:04:45.800> vine<00:04:46.070> crops<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.580> this

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
of times you see vine crops like this

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.070 
of times you see vine crops like this
sprawling<00:04:47.120> all<00:04:47.389> over<00:04:47.599> the<00:04:47.690> ground

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
sprawling all over the ground

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.230 
sprawling all over the ground
so<00:04:48.320> these<00:04:48.440> plants<00:04:48.889> you<00:04:49.009> can<00:04:49.130> see<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:50.030> been

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
so these plants you can see have been

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.230 
so these plants you can see have been
growing<00:04:50.750> for<00:04:50.990> about<00:04:51.229> five<00:04:51.680> months<00:04:51.949> now<00:04:52.190> and<00:04:52.639> we

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
growing for about five months now and we

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.760 
growing for about five months now and we
they<00:04:53.360> just<00:04:53.570> keep<00:04:53.780> wrapping<00:04:54.080> around<00:04:54.440> this

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
they just keep wrapping around this

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.790 
they just keep wrapping around this
system<00:04:55.220> this<00:04:56.030> is<00:04:56.180> actually<00:04:56.509> 24<00:04:57.050> basil<00:04:57.470> plants

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
system this is actually 24 basil plants

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.070 
system this is actually 24 basil plants
right<00:04:57.949> here<00:04:58.250> but<00:04:58.970> these<00:04:59.090> shorter<00:04:59.509> crops<00:04:59.780> that

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
right here but these shorter crops that

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080 
right here but these shorter crops that
we<00:05:00.169> can't<00:05:00.500> use<00:05:00.770> our<00:05:00.919> high<00:05:01.159> wire<00:05:01.430> production

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
we can't use our high wire production

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.490 
we can't use our high wire production
techniques<00:05:02.510> with<00:05:02.720> like<00:05:02.900> we<00:05:03.020> saw<00:05:03.229> with<00:05:03.260> the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
techniques with like we saw with the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.830 
techniques with like we saw with the
tomatoes<00:05:03.949> and<00:05:04.159> cucumbers<00:05:04.729> we<00:05:05.240> still<00:05:05.570> want<00:05:05.810> to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
tomatoes and cucumbers we still want to

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.659 
tomatoes and cucumbers we still want to
be<00:05:05.960> able<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.199> use<00:05:06.380> more<00:05:06.650> vertical<00:05:07.130> space<00:05:07.159> so

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
be able to use more vertical space so

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.700 
be able to use more vertical space so
this<00:05:07.940> is<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.090> demonstration<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:09.260> how<00:05:09.380> you<00:05:09.440> can

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
this is a demonstration of how you can

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.430 
this is a demonstration of how you can
grow<00:05:10.220> short<00:05:10.669> crops<00:05:11.000> vertically<00:05:11.690> collectively
