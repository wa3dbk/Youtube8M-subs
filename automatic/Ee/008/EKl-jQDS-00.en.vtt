00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
so we got a product showcasing for you

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.060 
so we got a product showcasing for you
guys<00:00:13.820> we<00:00:14.209> got<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:14.570> m4<00:00:15.460> 889<00:00:16.460> GTE<00:00:17.090> Pro<00:00:17.320> USB<00:00:18.320> 3.0

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
guys we got the m4 889 GTE Pro USB 3.0

guys we got the m4 889 GTE Pro USB 3.0
on<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.400> boy<00:00:19.600> this<00:00:20.600> is<00:00:20.780> a<00:00:20.810> CSIS<00:00:21.320> extreme<00:00:21.770> design

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
on the boy this is a CSIS extreme design

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.150 
on the boy this is a CSIS extreme design
number<00:00:23.240> one<00:00:23.420> performance<00:00:24.050> safety<00:00:24.950> and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
number one performance safety and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.060 
number one performance safety and
reliability<00:00:26.230> so<00:00:27.230> let's<00:00:27.380> see<00:00:27.560> what<00:00:27.740> we<00:00:27.860> got

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
reliability so let's see what we got

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.550 
reliability so let's see what we got
that's<00:00:28.460> six<00:00:28.820> coil<00:00:29.210> ready<00:00:29.420> Windows<00:00:30.230> seven

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
that's six coil ready Windows seven

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.540 
that's six coil ready Windows seven
ready<00:00:30.770> let's<00:00:31.310> aim<00:00:31.520> three<00:00:32.029> sockets<00:00:33.399> in<00:00:34.399> an

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
ready let's aim three sockets in an

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.500 
ready let's aim three sockets in an
onboard<00:00:34.850> video<00:00:35.270> it<00:00:35.809> has<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.230> HD<00:00:36.789> 4290<00:00:37.789> and<00:00:38.269> we

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
onboard video it has the HD 4290 and we

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.110 
onboard video it has the HD 4290 and we
got<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.899> hood<00:00:39.559> beat<00:00:40.039> my<00:00:40.339> VGX

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
got the hood beat my VGX

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.479 
got the hood beat my VGX
chipset<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:42.499> what<00:00:42.710> makes<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.010> different

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
chipset and what makes that different

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.450 
chipset and what makes that different
from<00:00:43.609> any<00:00:43.760> previous<00:00:44.510> generations<00:00:45.350> is<00:00:45.469> that<00:00:45.499> it

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
from any previous generations is that it

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.840 
from any previous generations is that it

motherboard layout let's get started we
have<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.830> CPU<00:04:13.400> socket<00:04:13.849> here<00:04:14.030> let's<00:04:14.569> suppose

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
have the CPU socket here let's suppose

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.060 
have the CPU socket here let's suppose
in<00:04:15.140> these<00:04:15.440> latest<00:04:15.890> am-3<00:04:16.729> socket<00:04:17.769> here<00:04:18.769> you

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
in these latest am-3 socket here you

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.620 
in these latest am-3 socket here you
insult<00:04:19.669> insert<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:21.100> memory<00:04:22.100> modules<00:04:22.729> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
insult insert the memory modules and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.439 
insult insert the memory modules and
this<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.110> different<00:04:24.500> because<00:04:24.979> on<00:04:25.430> most<00:04:25.880> suits

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449
