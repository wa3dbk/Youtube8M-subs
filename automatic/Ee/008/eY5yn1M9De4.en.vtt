00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:13.440
 It 's daylight here and it was very fake. 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.660
 old love, people talk 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 development that today are clashing 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 clans once again guys 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960
 today I'll tell you one 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.670
 experience that I had a war that the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 fla lost right? 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 a sage Irish snack already said 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.660
 that is in the defeat one learns 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.660
 it is true 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 so come on, what happened 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 in this war is a guy passed a car 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 on top of my life 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.129
 the dragons only attack with dragons 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.230
 and I thought it was fantastic to attack and I 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.050
 attack in the same war I made an attack 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.149
 copying and gave supercerto 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.359
 and I'll be bringing you this 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.960
 strategy that is very cool I will come 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.350
 fan 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:13.330
 honestly then let's go then guys 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:16.000
 will start the attack guy dodo can see 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.760
 My village has three points. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.470
 air defense here here and here 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.690
 he did eliminate this defense that only 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.640
 so the coolest of the strategy I 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.910
 I honestly think that you will see 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.280
 that he will not pay for this side of the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.220
 broken defense to air defense 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.470
 he will attack with the top of the defense 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.370
 Car Exactly to eliminate 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.410
 they because that's why the dragon he 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.400
 does not have a fixed target it's something 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.950
 random 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.050
 then it will be running and destroyed 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.060
 everything around you 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.270
 meanwhile they do begin 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.700
 doing that now is attacking them 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.710
 you dropping here on top of the others 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.080
 that the political project that 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.880
 destroyed southampton indicate the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.260
 probability of the dragon not doing this 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.119
 What happened here? 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.730
 is too big so I think they could 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.240
 have discovered that it is a bit of 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.820
 unlucky because there are the dragons ended up coming 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.890
 to this right side here at the stop but 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.980
 surely his idea was that they 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.840
 invade here and destroy that 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.160
 step that was the first event they did 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.780
 and then it's still like that did not let 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.780
 to be one with the rate 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.040
 unfortunately for him unfortunately for 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.090
 me he failed to give three stars 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.420
 but it was a beautiful attack and I 'm going 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.050
 repeat it 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.340
 You do not see or have been exactly one afternoon. 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.010
 equal 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.010
 the attack show 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.519
 looks that the dragon is detailing goalkeeper 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.980
 Level 2 already has a cool well hp 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.599
 High and delivery the level is already cool friend 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.400
 two main then 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:13.799
 he likes quite logical blow the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.269
 missing a dragon in the middle of the pasture is going 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.190
 to advance anything 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.730
 the strategy has here in the case he 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:28.500
 used 10 dragons that's 300 thousand mx 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:31.650
 to do the band and also did 86 per 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.790
 one hundred two stars here he used 10 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.030
 dragons used here the barbarian king who 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.560
 used and this card serves only for 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.940
 be able to help eliminate it and if it gets crap 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.860
 have to at the beginning of the village that happens 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.930
 the archrivals helping to break this 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.780
 here will be easier and faster the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.350
 dragons invade the village he used 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.470
 three lightning just to destroy 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.209
 one of them 123 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.130
 the pardon of one of the aerial defenses 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.609
 so let's now go to the attack that I 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.880
 made 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:19.099
 so here we are the guys I got 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.919
 a certain advantage 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:26.729
 can see that the opinion destroy the land 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.670
 them will I had about it is 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.830
 that is 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.770
 not exactly about it because that 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.370
 here was villa 1 of his clan 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.430
 Ávila number 1 and it's a cd 7 or she 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.060
 only has two air defenses and is 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.610
 a smaller village 16 and 17 my vision cd8 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.920
 the priest is also very big 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.390
 then it makes it harder to do all that 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.390
 here in the trajectory 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.780
 one of the things that upset and it was that 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.330
 give me that bid 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.390
 the dragons have everything on the right side 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.890
 has not entered the village core as the 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.410
 mine are doing here 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.970
 you can see that they stated I detonei here 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.350
 this airline of many lamps and 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.470
 He already invaded at what time they destroyed 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.470
 this and now just delete everything 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.850
 if you take a level 7 village 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.110
 It's basically right you from three 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.310
 stars 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.930
 second if it is a cd 8 there is no longer 100 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.330
 relative percentage because it is precisely the 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.700
 that will influence is the size of life 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:46.030
 of the face 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:48.460
 with the past, it also makes sense to 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.000
 level that has occupied the defenses he 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.140
 because it preserves the archer's tower 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.140
 tower of wizard 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.750
 they are all very well to 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.760
 they spank 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.100
 this dragon is also without counting that 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.150
 do not know 8 you already have two balloons 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:14.440
 blacks who at level 1 if not win 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.110
 now head of 1500 damage or 1200 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.710
 is something in this range of 1,200 and 1,500 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.770
 damage 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.260
 You have four red balloons on 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.650
 so if the car's defense is 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.710
 very well, maybe you can 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.350
 until you have some frustration but it's a 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.430
 excellent attack o notice that I used 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.160
 10 dragons 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.970
 I used three spells one meter on the level 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.220
 4 but this is indifferent because there is 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.720
 defense that he did not even need 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.440
 were level 4 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:50.020
 and for me to be able to give a help an aid 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.430
 that at the time of cleaning that in front of the 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:56.610
 team attack 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:59.410
 I used 5 wizards and my barbarian king 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.230
 so people this is it is this a 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.670
 strategy that you did not know 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.850
 Do you want to try after regretting? 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:09.010
 What you will like for sure is expensive to 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.170
 a heart attack is cheap and time consuming 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.470
 It's good, you need barracks level 9. 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:17.020
 to make your dragon and it is very 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.180
 time to do it and the cost is 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.320
 reaches the level of 30 thousand each in the 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.990
 level 1 10 now maybe 25 thousand eu 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.270
 will not the certainty but was created 25 000 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.790
 you are suppliers and will spend 300 thousand 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.770
 to make the 10 legal then galera 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.600
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.550

 Thanks a hug until the next I went and 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.530
 fantastic he has a very high damage 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:05.440
 he has an excellent tour 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:08.220
 It's very hard for the poor to be down. 

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.220
 in total
