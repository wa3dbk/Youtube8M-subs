end I've been doing this for a while
and<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.850> even<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.450> self-doubt<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.130> know

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
and I even have self-doubt but I know

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.000 
and I even have self-doubt but I know
it's<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:53.120> layering<00:01:53.630> process<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:54.560> kind<00:01:54.800> of<00:01:54.860> have

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
my favorite stores the market and so I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:35.390
