 here is the average time on the sites here also very important for you have 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450
 a good idea cb 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.470
 that those seven references are 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.370
 have a while but very good sites so you can perform some action 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.500
 specific for them sites 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.020
 to make it more and more possible for its public to be 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.369
 directed by percent and as a consequence carry out a sale 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.749
 depending on the type of segment you are working on 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.950
 leaving huge revenues and that this year and bounce rate 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.979
 It's just you can ask me the next question but this one already looks 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.800
 he was the one who generated 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.020
 sometimes in the morning a larger suitcase registered 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.249
 it really was what a visit from mr but if you ask me 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.639
 I tear 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.779
 Look, only paper gave you the question I said. 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.380
 my actions from marques 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.979
 and apply 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.619
 the only one on orkut 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.489
 I say 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.560
 look, this will depend on follow-up follow-up staff 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.689
 if the face from case to case because 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.689
 the following example parties you have a store of 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.109
 Also tasted of nani and electronic gadgets 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.159
 and you detect by google analytics 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.829
 orkut and twitter realize that the three main are the three 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.009
 main sites of reference here 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.119
 that give 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.500
 it's even bigger 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.900
 until then the cbuq let's simply understand this very well being personal 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.139
 and paper 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.309
 That I ran with lots of money. 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.939
 the parties users who send google analytcs 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.979
 they think that 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:10.859
 for a year 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.539
 Trajano specific sites much more than 20 people 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:16.899
 work upon it 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:20.339
 you can not forget the others others are bringing you visits 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.709
 You also have to apply 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.489
 marketing actions on top of that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.099
 not so strong 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.049
 how much 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.470
 The kit attracts more visitors but it does not say 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.219
 leave aside 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.059
 so come on 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.459
 normal back you are what we were talking about 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.389
 so what are you going to do? 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.439
 yea 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.599
 in our case here when going out of collective purchase or agenda kuyt 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.640
 15 days more 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.509
 you should rather apply strategic actions 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:55.239
 on the goal of the orkut tac platform and the reference sites we have 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.309
 more people for you 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:58.540
 so you can 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.269
 to the man 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.769
 It's even more 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.729
 pizzas this public and in addition to injured 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.909
 on your website 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:07.950
 with respect 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.339
 to twitter and facebook 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.339
 What you can do is as I said earlier. 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:13.840
 you also have to 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.180
 direct actions 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.150
 strong 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.519
 a little old strong personal 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.680
 if you want 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.509
 Orkut it is increasing a lot 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.800
 the ones you visit will work on it to make this 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.650
 number increases more and more 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.400
 with respect to others you also have to apply a strong tire an action 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.419
 strong for what? 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.010

 I want social on twitter facebook 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.080
 they can really understand 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.860
 that what you tarr 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.860
 involving granddaughter bringing them 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.379
 Look, just see how much you need. 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.090

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.120

 in bing searches there is need 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.020
 if we go 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.180
 Do not cry, we're okay. 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.449
 they want said food is a necessity if we go a chopp 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.529
 and I buy shoes is a necessity if people 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.580
 with few is such a need 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.029
 every human being 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:23.400
 on the face of the earth 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.370

 it's tooth 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.749
 if your audience there on the dash is more twitter 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:40.159
 works a lot more on twitter but I do not think your curtain think faces 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.759
 book 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.080
 if it's only for you 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.349
 We work great on orkut but I do not forget tuece fecebook 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:49.370
 if it was worked it was facebook to bring a lot of people 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.610
 I do not think it's true that this does not happen if it's called minds 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.300
 knowing that 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.320
 the other 10 that has here that the google analyitics that it provides also should not 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.030
 if you forget people that is why you should have 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.070
 if you do not have the financial structure to have a team to think about with you 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.070
 or you can do it yourself 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.580
 down simply you 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.580
 knows how directional the best way possible 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.869
 nothing can be ruled out 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:18.499
 a person who 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:22.499
 will keep the sites between those who do not like it does not come back anymore 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.870
 he who enters it will bring many other visitors 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.589
 imagine that 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.759
 the boy user of this 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.520
 in the same position that in less than 24 hours 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.779
 he can recommend to a thousand people he knows 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.229
 now imagine 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.400
 dci they were 2000 almost 66 20 dislike not 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.199
 he goes 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.619
 speak badly for 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.639
 5 thousand people he knows 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.479
 the internet is like this 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.259
 everything you should have 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.120
 how can you be disabled attach to this 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.490
 know how to define 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.530
 these actions in the best possible way 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.529
 and there as a consequence 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:02.030
 increasing more and more 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.930
 but this number 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.229
 increases in this number you are sure to generate revenue 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.339
 could you understand 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:11.469
 It's difficult, it's not difficult, as I always say. 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:13.169
 the point is that you should know 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.360
 interpreted 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.159
 all in the best possible way 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.190
 I always say 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.639
 to the students staff in life there is no difficulty 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.990
 the difficulty who puts light sound and in the team 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.690
 It all depends on the reasoning qi if you really know how to interpret your 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.849
 What is being said with certainty 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:37.649
