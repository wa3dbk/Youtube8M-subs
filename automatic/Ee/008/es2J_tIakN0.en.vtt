want to show you something that a tape
echo<00:00:37.700> can<00:00:38.270> do<00:00:38.450> that<00:00:38.720> pretty<00:00:38.870> much<00:00:39.140> no<00:00:39.440> other

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
echo can do that pretty much no other

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.320 
echo can do that pretty much no other
delay<00:00:40.010> pedal<00:00:40.310> can<00:00:40.490> do<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.700> we're<00:00:41.030> going<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.240> do

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
delay pedal can do it we're going to do

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.200 
delay pedal can do it we're going to do
what<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:41.570> call<00:00:41.840> long<00:00:42.680> cord<00:00:43.340> repeat<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.060> we've

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
what I call long cord repeat so we've

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.850 
what I call long cord repeat so we've
actually<00:00:44.330> taken<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.840> unit<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.410> actually

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
actually taken the unit and actually

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.380 
actually taken the unit and actually
stretched<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.340> tape<00:00:46.550> pretty<00:00:46.910> much<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.239> its

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
stretched the tape pretty much to its

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.120 
stretched the tape pretty much to its
maximum<00:00:47.720> capacity<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.500> turn<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.739> repeats

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
maximum capacity and turn the repeats

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.740 
maximum capacity and turn the repeats
pretty<00:00:49.430> high<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.210> this<00:00:50.360> will<00:00:50.510> be<00:00:50.600> actually

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
pretty high so this will be actually

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.770 
pretty high so this will be actually
pretty<00:00:51.080> much<00:00:51.290> ride<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.700> ride<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.390> unit<00:00:53.690> we

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
pretty much ride the ride the unit we

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.780 
pretty much ride the ride the unit we
let<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.320> unit<00:00:54.620> do<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.920> work<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:55.370> just

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
let the unit do the work and you just

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.880 
let the unit do the work and you just
kind<00:00:55.970> of<00:00:56.000> kick<00:00:56.239> back<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.630> play<00:00:56.809> behind<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.410> so

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
kind of kick back and play behind it so

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.560 
kind of kick back and play behind it so
since<00:00:58.100> we<00:00:58.220> have<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.580> volume<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.150> loud<00:00:59.330> and<00:00:59.390> the

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
since we have the volume so loud and the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.420 
since we have the volume so loud and the
repeat<00:00:59.900> so<00:01:00.140> heavy<00:01:00.410> that's<00:01:01.040> what's<00:01:01.250> going<00:01:01.339> to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
repeat so heavy that's what's going to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.560 
repeat so heavy that's what's going to
make<00:01:01.519> tone<00:01:01.850> different<00:01:02.269> than<00:01:02.360> what<00:01:02.480> most

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
make tone different than what most

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.450 
make tone different than what most
pedals<00:01:02.900> can<00:01:03.050> do<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:03.620> I'm<00:01:04.160> going<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.309> do<00:01:04.400> that

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
pedals can do so I'm going to do that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.550 
pedals can do so I'm going to do that
same<00:01:04.550> thing<00:01:04.699> on<00:01:05.300> our<00:01:05.330> intro<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.020> I'll<00:01:06.350> show

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
same thing on our intro and I'll show

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.230 
same thing on our intro and I'll show
you<00:01:06.590> some<00:01:06.770> really<00:01:06.890> neat<00:01:07.100> tricks<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:08.120> you<00:01:08.150> can

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
you some really neat tricks that you can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.390 
you some really neat tricks that you can
do<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:09.410> thing<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.590> want<00:01:09.800> to<00:01:09.920> stress<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.370> that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
do so one thing I want to stress is that

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.740 
do so one thing I want to stress is that
when<00:01:10.580> you're<00:01:10.700> playing<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.090> really<00:01:11.450> got<00:01:11.600> to

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
when you're playing you really got to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.410 
when you're playing you really got to
get<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.020> good<00:01:12.620> rhythm<00:01:12.920> hand<00:01:13.370> on<00:01:14.090> your<00:01:14.270> on

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
get this good rhythm hand on your on

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.790 
get this good rhythm hand on your on
your<00:01:14.450> strumming<00:01:14.810> hand<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.290> that's<00:01:15.590> really

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
your strumming hand and that's really

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.410 
your strumming hand and that's really
what's<00:01:15.950> going<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.159> trigger<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.060> if<00:01:17.300> you

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
what's going to trigger it so if you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.760 
what's going to trigger it so if you
like<00:01:17.659> I'll<00:01:17.810> do<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:17.960> little<00:01:18.110> example<00:01:18.409> right<00:01:18.740> now

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
like I'll do a little example right now

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:28.500 
like I'll do a little example right now
for<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.159> will<00:01:19.280> play<00:01:19.430> soft<00:01:19.700> without<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.360> pic

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.120 

so<00:01:29.510> you<00:01:29.570> can<00:01:29.930> hear<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.200> little<00:01:30.380> softness<00:01:30.890> of

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
so you can hear the little softness of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.290 
so you can hear the little softness of
that<00:01:31.280> but<00:01:31.460> listen<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.880> difference<00:01:32.180> when

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
that but listen to the difference when

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.060 
that but listen to the difference when
we<00:01:32.360> actually<00:01:32.660> use<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> pick<00:01:33.080> on

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.399 

so<00:01:40.070> what<00:01:40.249> we<00:01:40.340> can<00:01:40.460> actually<00:01:40.609> do<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.569> play<00:01:42.140> that

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
so what we can actually do is play that

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.709 
so what we can actually do is play that
it's<00:01:42.770> still<00:01:42.950> going<00:01:43.159> well<00:01:43.759> what<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:44.569> can

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
it's still going well what we can

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.980 
it's still going well what we can
actually<00:01:44.869> do<00:01:45.319> hey<00:01:46.329> listen<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.569> sustained

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
actually do hey listen to the sustained

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.889 
actually do hey listen to the sustained
but<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:49.219> can<00:01:49.399> actually<00:01:49.490> do<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.359> is

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
but what we can actually do is is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.539 
but what we can actually do is is
actually<00:01:51.319> use<00:01:51.469> that<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.740> our<00:01:51.770> advantage<00:01:51.829> so

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
actually use that to our advantage so

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.459 
actually use that to our advantage so
I'm<00:01:52.789> pretty<00:01:53.329> much<00:01:53.390> going<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.689> be<00:01:53.749> playing<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
I'm pretty much going to be playing the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.840 
I'm pretty much going to be playing the
same<00:01:54.649> chords<00:01:54.950> over<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.280> over<00:01:55.369> but<00:01:55.579> I'm<00:01:55.700> going

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
same chords over and over but I'm going

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.389 
same chords over and over but I'm going
to<00:01:55.939> actually<00:01:56.090> be<00:01:56.299> using<00:01:57.049> my<00:01:57.170> hands<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.709> using

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
to actually be using my hands and using

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.880 
to actually be using my hands and using
my<00:01:58.429> pics<00:01:58.849> but<00:01:59.119> since<00:01:59.329> our<00:01:59.539> timing<00:02:00.409> is<00:02:00.500> set<00:02:00.679> so

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
my pics but since our timing is set so

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.319 
my pics but since our timing is set so
long<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.369> gives<00:02:01.549> me<00:02:01.700> all<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.000> time<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
long it gives me all this time to

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.779 
long it gives me all this time to
literally<00:02:02.899> just<00:02:03.079> sit<00:02:03.380> back<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:03.950> actually<00:02:04.429> let

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
literally just sit back and actually let

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.429 
literally just sit back and actually let
the<00:02:05.030> unit<00:02:05.329> do<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.569> work<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.990> I'll<00:02:06.079> kind<00:02:06.289> of

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
the unit do the work and I'll kind of

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.889 
the unit do the work and I'll kind of
control<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.920> behind<00:02:07.310> from<00:02:07.549> behind<00:02:07.579> so<00:02:08.239> let's

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
control it behind from behind so let's

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.300 
control it behind from behind so let's
try<00:02:09.049> that<00:02:09.170> example<00:02:09.619> right<00:02:09.799> now<00:02:09.830> maybe<00:02:10.129> the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
try that example right now maybe the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.440 
try that example right now maybe the
same<00:02:10.429> thing<00:02:10.640> I'm<00:02:10.729> going<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.910> fade<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.269> with

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
same thing I'm going to fade it in with

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.140 
same thing I'm going to fade it in with
my<00:02:11.739> master<00:02:12.739> volume<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:13.610> really<00:02:13.730> smooth

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
my master volume so it's really smooth

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.729 
my master volume so it's really smooth
and<00:02:14.299> as<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.629> keep<00:02:14.840> getting<00:02:15.019> into<00:02:15.379> it<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:15.620> going

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
and as I keep getting into it I'm going

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.949 
and as I keep getting into it I'm going
to<00:02:15.769> do<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> little<00:02:16.579> bit<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.819> hooks<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.599> add-ons

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
to do a little bit of hooks and add-ons

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.449 
to do a little bit of hooks and add-ons
to<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.290> chords<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.829> you'll<00:02:19.099> actually<00:02:19.220> hear

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
to the chords and you'll actually hear

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.740 
to the chords and you'll actually hear
that<00:02:19.640> repeating<00:02:20.120> over<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.390> over<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.690> over

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
that repeating over and over and over

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:57.000 
that repeating over and over and over
again<00:02:20.959> let's<00:02:21.590> try<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.829> right<00:02:22.010> now

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.640 

so<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.330> if<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.659> notice<00:02:58.959> what<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.230> did<00:02:59.260> right

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
so if you if you notice what I did right

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.770 
so if you if you notice what I did right
there<00:02:59.709> I<00:03:00.189> would<00:03:00.640> keep<00:03:00.909> bouncing<00:03:01.420> back<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
there I would keep bouncing back and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.800 
there I would keep bouncing back and
forth<00:03:01.870> i<00:03:02.260> do<00:03:02.319> have<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.739> much<00:03:02.860> time<00:03:03.360> between<00:03:04.360> my

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
forth i do have so much time between my

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.300 
forth i do have so much time between my
actual<00:03:05.140> chord<00:03:05.409> changes<00:03:05.799> it's<00:03:05.980> going<00:03:06.129> to<00:03:06.189> make

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
actual chord changes it's going to make

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.100 
actual chord changes it's going to make
it<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.549> lot<00:03:06.790> easier<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.480> give<00:03:07.599> me<00:03:07.689> more<00:03:07.840> time<00:03:07.870> to

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
it a lot easier and give me more time to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.170 
it a lot easier and give me more time to
actually<00:03:08.319> keep<00:03:08.650> moving<00:03:09.010> back<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.340> forth<00:03:09.400> so

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
actually keep moving back and forth so

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.610 
actually keep moving back and forth so
all<00:03:10.329> I'm<00:03:10.450> doing<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.750> really<00:03:10.900> keeping<00:03:11.140> my<00:03:11.379> pic

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
all I'm doing is really keeping my pic

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.619 
all I'm doing is really keeping my pic
right<00:03:11.799> here<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.099> my<00:03:12.189> fingers<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.879> I'm<00:03:13.360> doing

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
right here in my fingers and I'm doing

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.080 
right here in my fingers and I'm doing
soft<00:03:13.930> strums<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:14.739> then<00:03:15.250> with<00:03:15.400> chords<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:15.940> what

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
soft strums and then with chords so what

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.970 
soft strums and then with chords so what
that<00:03:16.120> does<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.629> creates<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:17.079> really<00:03:17.349> cool

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
that does is it creates this really cool

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.559 
that does is it creates this really cool
accented<00:03:18.610> effect<00:03:18.970> if<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.209> listen<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.540> it

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
accented effect if you listen to it

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.180 
accented effect if you listen to it
right<00:03:19.750> here<00:03:19.930> listen<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.319> just<00:03:20.560> my<00:03:20.709> strumming

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
right here listen to just my strumming

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.630 
right here listen to just my strumming
with<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> cords<00:03:21.640> muted<00:03:23.069> here<00:03:24.069> allowed<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.519> is

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
with the cords muted here allowed it is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.970 
with the cords muted here allowed it is
now<00:03:25.209> let's<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.569> try<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.780> with<00:03:25.900> my<00:03:26.049> thumb<00:03:26.079> once

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
now let's just try it with my thumb once

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.140 
now let's just try it with my thumb once
this<00:03:27.099> fades<00:03:27.370> out<00:03:27.549> listen<00:03:27.909> to<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.060> difference

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
this fades out listen to the difference

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.740 
this fades out listen to the difference
you're<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> difference<00:03:31.569> right<00:03:31.629> there

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
you're the difference right there

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.420 
you're the difference right there
they're<00:03:32.349> bouncing<00:03:32.709> back<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:33.010> forth<00:03:33.099> between

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
they're bouncing back and forth between

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.860 
they're bouncing back and forth between
the<00:03:33.670> two<00:03:33.700> tones<00:03:34.120> let's<00:03:34.450> try<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.690> one<00:03:34.750> more

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
the two tones let's try that one more

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.069 
the two tones let's try that one more
time<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:40.060> here<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.329> two<00:03:40.540> sounds<00:03:40.870> are<00:03:40.900> just

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
time so here the two sounds are just

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.660 
time so here the two sounds are just
bouncing<00:03:41.470> back<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.739> forth<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.280> pretty<00:03:42.609> much

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
bouncing back and forth and pretty much

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.099 
bouncing back and forth and pretty much
that's<00:03:42.790> what<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.209> was<00:03:43.420> doing<00:03:43.659> the<00:03:43.780> whole<00:03:43.930> time

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
that's what I was doing the whole time

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.080 
that's what I was doing the whole time
with<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.470> FBI<00:03:44.739> unit<00:03:45.129> you<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.670> use<00:03:45.819> it<00:03:45.970> pretty

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
with the FBI unit you just use it pretty

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.250 
with the FBI unit you just use it pretty
much<00:03:46.269> in<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.420> real<00:03:46.569> time<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.840> use<00:03:46.959> different

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
much in a real time you use different

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.020 
much in a real time you use different
porting<00:03:47.590> let<00:03:48.159> me<00:03:48.280> show<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.639> chords<00:03:48.940> that

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
porting let me show you the chords that

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.360 
porting let me show you the chords that
I'm<00:03:49.180> using<00:03:49.359> for<00:03:49.720> today's<00:03:50.079> example<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:51.310> is

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
I'm using for today's example this is

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.699 
I'm using for today's example this is
very<00:03:51.790> easy<00:03:52.060> setup<00:03:52.569> and<00:03:52.900> explain<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.500> why<00:03:53.680> I

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
very easy setup and explain to you why I

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.379 
very easy setup and explain to you why I
am<00:03:53.889> doing<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.370> I'm<00:03:54.700> pretty<00:03:55.060> much<00:03:55.090> going<00:03:55.329> to

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
am doing this I'm pretty much going to

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.140 
am doing this I'm pretty much going to
pull<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.629> play<00:03:55.989> an<00:03:56.139> E<00:03:56.290> major<00:03:56.500> ok<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.730> then

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
pull it play an E major ok and then

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.220 
pull it play an E major ok and then
what's<00:03:58.329> going<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.540> happen<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:58.959> I'm<00:03:59.049> literally

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
what's going to happen is I'm literally

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.809 
what's going to happen is I'm literally
just<00:03:59.379> going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> slide<00:03:59.829> it<00:04:00.040> right<00:04:00.069> up<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.730> the

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
just going to slide it right up to the

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.909 
just going to slide it right up to the
fifth<00:04:01.030> fret<00:04:01.209> for<00:04:02.109> the<00:04:02.199> root<00:04:02.379> and<00:04:02.590> they're

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
fifth fret for the root and they're

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.830 
fifth fret for the root and they're
going<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.099> go<00:04:03.160> right<00:04:03.340> up<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.730> 7th<00:04:04.090> fret<00:04:04.329> now

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
going to go right up to the 7th fret now

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.420 
going to go right up to the 7th fret now
the<00:04:05.019> reason<00:04:05.139> I'm<00:04:05.379> doing<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.709> as<00:04:05.980> opposed<00:04:06.280> to

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
the reason I'm doing that as opposed to

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.900 
the reason I'm doing that as opposed to
playing<00:04:06.669> in<00:04:06.910> E<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:08.079> G<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.650> an<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.669> because

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
playing in E and a G and an a is because

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.610 
playing in E and a G and an a is because
when<00:04:10.269> I<00:04:10.299> actually<00:04:10.510> have<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.989> open<00:04:11.290> strings

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
when I actually have the open strings

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.800 
when I actually have the open strings
playing<00:04:11.889> it<00:04:12.069> gives<00:04:12.220> me<00:04:12.370> more<00:04:12.400> room<00:04:12.849> to
