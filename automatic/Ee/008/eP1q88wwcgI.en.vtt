when I was a senior in a junior in high
school<00:02:31.340> but<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.550> way<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.150> did<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.569> was

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
school but the way that I did that was

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.190 
school but the way that I did that was
like<00:02:34.620> starving<00:02:35.489> myself<00:02:36.050> using<00:02:37.050> fen-phen

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
like starving myself using fen-phen

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.150 
like starving myself using fen-phen
using<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.380> then<00:02:40.590> i<00:02:40.620> went<00:02:40.830> from<00:02:41.040> 250<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.650> 199<00:02:43.650> or

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
using but then i went from 250 to 199 or

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.120 
using but then i went from 250 to 199 or
thereabouts<00:02:45.080> actually<00:02:46.080> 200<00:02:46.769> because<00:02:47.040> I

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
thereabouts actually 200 because I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.000 
thereabouts actually 200 because I
remember<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.610> doctor<00:02:47.970> saying<00:02:48.000> Oh<00:02:48.860> next<00:02:49.860> week
