00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
here but it all end up working out

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
here but it all end up working out
anyway<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> assault<00:01:12.630> package

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
on here which also tends to work out

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.960 
on here which also tends to work out
pretty<00:01:15.240> good<00:01:15.979> especially<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.520> people<00:01:17.820> don't

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
pretty good especially if people don't

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
pretty good especially if people don't
shoot<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.600> choppers<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.439> assault

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
shoot down your choppers the assault

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.429 
shoot down your choppers the assault
killstreaks<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.240> link<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.170> kills

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
killstreaks do link so if you get kills

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
killstreaks do link so if you get kills
the<00:01:22.619> predator<00:01:22.950> missile<00:01:23.250> it'll<00:01:23.400> count<00:01:23.640> towards

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the predator missile it'll count towards

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.830 
the predator missile it'll count towards
you<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.740> chopper<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.750> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you know that chopper so it can be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.539 
you know that chopper so it can be
pretty<00:01:28.080> easy<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.619> Shane<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> couple<00:01:29.369> kills

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
pretty easy just Shane a couple kills

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:39.150 
pretty easy just Shane a couple kills
together

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.590 

trying<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.220> get<00:01:40.310> greedy<00:01:40.550> and<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.910> just<00:01:41.270> didn't

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
trying to get greedy and it just didn't

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.250 
trying to get greedy and it just didn't
work<00:01:41.750> out<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.800> i<00:01:42.980> think<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:43.760> shot<00:01:44.390> pretty

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
work out but i think that shot pretty

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.650 
work out but i think that shot pretty
much<00:01:45.440> makes<00:01:45.710> up<00:01:45.860> for<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.120> now<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.450> have

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
much makes up for it so now that I have

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.330 
much makes up for it so now that I have
this<00:01:47.810> chopper<00:01:48.440> out<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.920> really<00:01:49.130> destroy

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
this chopper out you can really destroy

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.180 
this chopper out you can really destroy
certain<00:01:50.090> see<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.480> kills<00:01:50.720> rack<00:01:50.960> up<00:01:51.170> as<00:01:51.410> nobody

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
certain see the kills rack up as nobody

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.600 
certain see the kills rack up as nobody
shoot<00:01:52.430> her<00:01:52.580> down<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.680> that's<00:01:54.800> me<00:01:55.100> or<00:01:55.430> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
shoot her down and that's me or the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.100 
shoot her down and that's me or the
reason<00:01:55.850> i<00:01:55.910> put<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.090> Stinger<00:01:56.450> on<00:01:56.479> every<00:01:56.750> class<00:01:56.930> I

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
reason i put a Stinger on every class I

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.350 
reason i put a Stinger on every class I
have<00:01:57.260> because<00:01:57.620> that<00:01:58.310> airs<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:58.729> will<00:01:59.000> rack<00:01:59.180> up

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
have because that airs for will rack up

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.090 
have because that airs for will rack up
kills<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.900> typically<00:02:00.440> make<00:02:00.590> your<00:02:00.710> team<00:02:00.890> lose

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
kills and typically make your team lose

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.760 
kills and typically make your team lose
if<00:02:01.280> nobody<00:02:01.580> shoots<00:02:01.790> him<00:02:01.910> down<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:03.140> often

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
if nobody shoots him down and often

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
one down and it will chain and take out

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
people through Paris I still think it's

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.379 
people through Paris I still think it's
a<00:03:57.260> little<00:03:57.439> ridiculous<00:03:57.620> but<00:03:57.889> you<00:03:58.129> know<00:03:58.389> Cole

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
a little ridiculous but you know Cole

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.000 
a little ridiculous but you know Cole
duty<00:03:59.689> itself<00:04:00.049> is<00:04:00.200> pretty<00:04:00.319> ridiculous<00:04:00.500> so

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
duty itself is pretty ridiculous so

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.009 
duty itself is pretty ridiculous so
