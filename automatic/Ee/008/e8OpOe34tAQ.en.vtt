 counts a share of the championship goal 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.110
 whoever after his substitute enters 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.000

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.080
 I expected to lie down in the story 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.080
 but the fatality 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:34.050
 Achúcarro the car was tracking 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.700
 the celebration of Pablo moral 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.940
 three consecutive victories 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.700
 a team that had not won 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.430
 and we are understanding a lot because 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.019
 We have been leaving for the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.720
 substitutes so I play a lot together and 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.159
 good today we were dominated great 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.110
 part of the party when we left 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.000
 risk a little more we find what 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.530
 we wanted we had our options 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.269
 and we take advantage of what you think 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.680
 failed 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.959
 I think we played a good game but 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.569
 We could not liquidate it, we have to see the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.569
 opportunity after such
