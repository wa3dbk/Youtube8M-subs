00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.259
 very good everyone I'm good darth 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.199
 we are here in the seventh step of the 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.900
 Maxis isstech in buried well there is 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.640
 what to do with this map then on this extreme 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.350
 in this step you have to memorize 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.230
 you ring some numbers that you can tell 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.790
 the first ring is the first 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.739
 you have to do as number one 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.769
 it would be the one that we found nothing else 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.900
 are the stairs of the church one is 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.790
 the two and the third on which will support 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.019
 my partner and I would approach we are in 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.120
 the top floor of the store 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.589
 candies vale would be first to the in the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.149
 that we find ourselves facing then the 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.370
 bottom to the right and then the one that is 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.399
 next laporta is worth now let's go to 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.949
 the second part of where they are 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.860
 are these stamps what would be the 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.960
 stable shifts for there good and 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.810
 we are here in the state in the room 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.300
 stamp of which it has to be number 4 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.399
 it would be this this is number 4 not you 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.440
 forget this is the order that you have to 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.190
 start you have to make each bell 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.410
 with a number do not forget that would be 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.530
 the number 4 the number 5 would be this that 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.939
 is here number 5 do not forget and the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.939
 sixth number would be 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.569
 here it would be here be next to where we 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.359
 we throw and well let's go now to the 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:44.390
 third part is where we can find 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:46.189
 these these three remaining stamps that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.069
 would be the court worth not forget the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.569
 steps and now we look good we are 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.969
 here in court and good the first 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.039
 which would correspond to the 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.259
 seventh issue would this this would be the 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.869
 seven the number seven the seven bell 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.209
 this would be the bell or not 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.789
 we find here next to the courthouse and 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.979
 the bell nine would be this one that is here 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.970
 the rest is worth it and now we are going to go to 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.190
 why the final step of why 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.530
 because we need these numbers and you're 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.680
 correspondence with the standard bells 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.140
 haunted house and we are already here in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.580
 the haunted house and good good now 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.280
 start the thing that everyone has to 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.040
 be at your base in your in your area the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.210
 three other partners and have good is the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.920
 knowing what is what number each 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.370
 well we have to come here is this 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.690
 apparatus we have to give it the lever 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.160
 recommends coming without pasta to give 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.340
 with a few days organized to the witch who 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.230
 only one will come with ammunition and 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.840
 good to what corresponds this vale 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.240
 we have to associate each flashlight from 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.420
 those nine that there are with each of the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.730
 lanterns of the bells that there is worth 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.970
 let's start to number 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.840
 from per column from left to right 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.230
 OK 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.820
 and 1 2 and 3 in vertical would be the first 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.180
 column is to say the first three that 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.750
 are vertical they would correspond to 1 2 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.330
 and 3 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.520
 starting with 1 above and ending with 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.950
 the 3 below then it would be the second 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.489
 column the middle column vertically 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.900
 4 5 and 6 starting with 4 above and 6 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.790
 down 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.150
 and in the last column it would be what 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.939
 same 7 8 and 9 ok and what to do 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.890
 here, obviously, you have to give it, there is still 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.890
 to give here to this lever and when 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.620
 you have to tell him that you have to 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.030
 say the one that is here on the lever with 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.590
 this device you have to say by 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.870
 example now this would correspond to 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.079
 number 6 and you have to say 6 and then 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.939
 you see it now my partner who is in 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.310
 the area of 6 read correctly I 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.959
 I would have to tell 7 what is that 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.230
 yellow that is there and then when 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.629
 if it gives correctly it turns green 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.760
 and we're going to go like this and you have to fill in 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.590
 that filling all the space is worth 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.090
 something a little mess 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.349
 can you ask me the best in 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.989
 comments on the internet but I think that 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.659
 it was quite simple, let's not forget 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:13.120
 in the 9 light bulbs here is nine 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.980
 stamps and you start to start 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.199
 that they make each other lose 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.359
 hitting here would be the 1 that would be the 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.489
 Up first it is what is right is 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.650
 is more than 9 that is the last one that is 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.010
 there I think now with what I'm 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.470
 saying you can easily understand what 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.630
 I say now I will put you I think this is the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.699
 beast finally we do all the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.949
 correctly because my friends like it 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.220
 better they were not completely clever 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:42.180
 Well, 9 would be correct in this case 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.180
 it would be 4 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.610
 the 5 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.440
 the 2 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.499
 the 3 now the 7 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.639
 the 1 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.479
 now on 6 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.880
 and finally the 8 and it is already complete and 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.870
 I believe that now with this light what 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.770
 we have done here right now that what 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.449
 let's do 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.969
 it's pretty clear now it starts to 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.069
 maxis start dialogue 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.839
 well I've done all this step so that 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.389
 You see, I think it's pretty clear 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.739
 because we have done here all together if 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.329
 do you have any doubt put them in the 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:33.789
 comments this step to the best is a 

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:35.139
 little is easy is simple but you have to 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.519
 have a couple of clear things 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.259
 If you do not have clear things about the 

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:40.119
 comments and before asking questions 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.279
 see if the comments are answered 

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:43.809
 and she feels good step we are like 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.819
 subscribed favorites if it is not if one 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:48.629
 is next video feels like the 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.629
 goodbye stress
