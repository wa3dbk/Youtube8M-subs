00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
it makes it makes a little harder for

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.320 
it makes it makes a little harder for
people<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.290> hack<00:03:20.290> into<00:03:20.560> your<00:03:20.830> iCloud<00:03:21.580> if<00:03:22.090> you

people to hack into your iCloud if you

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.960 
people to hack into your iCloud if you
will<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.160> I'm<00:03:24.160> curious<00:03:24.370> why<00:03:24.580> they<00:03:24.700> didn't<00:03:24.880> do

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
will so I'm curious why they didn't do

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.120 
will so I'm curious why they didn't do
this<00:03:25.090> earlier<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.540> lot<00:03:25.959> obviously<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.920> fact

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
this earlier a lot obviously the fact

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.030 
this earlier a lot obviously the fact
they<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.490> do<00:03:27.550> is<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.880> quick<00:03:28.410> they<00:03:29.410> had<00:03:29.920> it

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
they can do is this quick they had it

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.860 
they can do is this quick they had it
ready<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.370> think<00:03:30.730> maybe<00:03:31.060> they<00:03:31.720> were<00:03:31.780> just

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
ready I think maybe they were just

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.750 
ready I think maybe they were just
putting<00:03:32.260> off<00:03:32.500> securing<00:03:33.130> iCloud<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> little<00:03:33.670> bit

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
putting off securing iCloud a little bit

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.980 
putting off securing iCloud a little bit
more<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.240> that's<00:03:34.420> what<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.570> wish<00:03:34.720> they'd<00:03:34.870> done

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
more that that's what I wish they'd done

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.630 
more that that's what I wish they'd done
a<00:03:35.020> little<00:03:35.140> bit<00:03:35.290> earlier<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:36.040> this<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.520> my

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
a little bit earlier and this is my

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.460 
a little bit earlier and this is my
