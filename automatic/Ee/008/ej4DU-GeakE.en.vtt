00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
signed the plan so I signed them

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.110 
signed the plan so I signed them
now<00:03:33.200> here's<00:03:33.980> something<00:03:34.250> snake<00:03:35.290> so<00:03:36.879> Jake<00:03:37.879> till

did<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:38.659> for<00:03:38.930> me<00:03:39.109> but<00:03:39.769> what<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:39.980> did<00:03:40.310> was<00:03:40.549> ahead

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
did this for me but what I did was ahead

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.170 
did this for me but what I did was ahead
this<00:03:41.000> idea<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.349> sea<00:03:42.650> it's<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.340> difficult

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
this idea just the sea it's so difficult

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.390 
this idea just the sea it's so difficult
to<00:03:44.780> get<00:03:44.959> across<00:03:45.079> what<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.159> shape<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.670> on<00:03:46.939> it<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
to get across what the shape is on it I

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.899 
to get across what the shape is on it I
took<00:03:49.659> 8-inch<00:03:51.849> poplar<00:03:52.849> veneer<00:03:53.530> painted<00:03:54.530> black

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
took 8-inch poplar veneer painted black

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.800 
took 8-inch poplar veneer painted black
glued<00:03:55.909> it<00:03:56.030> up<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:57.319> carve<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.069> see<00:03:58.250> how<00:03:58.430> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
glued it up and carve to see how that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.949 
glued it up and carve to see how that
actually<00:03:59.810> I<00:04:00.340> didn't<00:04:01.340> card<00:04:01.519> see<00:04:01.790> Haley<00:04:02.629> was

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
actually I didn't card see Haley was

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.929 
actually I didn't card see Haley was
already<00:04:03.230> courtesy<00:04:03.739> for<00:04:03.950> me<00:04:04.099> because<00:04:04.730> during

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
already courtesy for me because during

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.879 
already courtesy for me because during
that<00:04:05.060> time<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:05.359> was<00:04:05.659> rested<00:04:06.019> in<00:04:06.109> my<00:04:06.260> trying<00:04:06.829> to

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
that time I was rested in my trying to

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.849 
that time I was rested in my trying to
get<00:04:06.980> my<00:04:07.040> elbows<00:04:07.220> rest<00:04:07.840> but<00:04:08.840> as<00:04:09.319> you<00:04:09.530> can<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:09.650> it

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
get my elbows rest but as you can see it

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.309 
get my elbows rest but as you can see it
turned<00:04:10.069> out<00:04:10.189> great<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.879> got<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.319> exact

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
turned out great so you got a exact

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.779 
turned out great so you got a exact
contour<00:04:12.889> of<00:04:14.439> what<00:04:15.439> how<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:15.739> could<00:04:16.130> see<00:04:16.430> because

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
contour of what how I could see because

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.509 
contour of what how I could see because
it<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.000> actually<00:04:17.449> a<00:04:18.049> light-hearted<00:04:18.680> seed<00:04:19.190> so

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
it is actually a light-hearted seed so

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.860 
it is actually a light-hearted seed so
it<00:04:19.549> looks<00:04:19.910> pretty<00:04:20.090> cool<00:04:20.299> too

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
it looks pretty cool too

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.300 
it looks pretty cool too
I'm<00:04:21.590> not<00:04:21.769> going<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.009> poster<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.550> every<00:04:22.789> time<00:04:24.310> so

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
I'm not going to poster of every time so

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.870 
I'm not going to poster of every time so
then<00:04:25.880> Jake<00:04:26.449> tittle<00:04:26.870> took<00:04:27.590> picture<00:04:28.009> of<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.250> and

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
then Jake tittle took picture of it and

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.499 
then Jake tittle took picture of it and
turned<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.360> into<00:04:29.539> this<00:04:30.370> tipo<00:04:31.370> map<00:04:31.580> its<00:04:32.000> contour

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
turned it into this tipo map its contour

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.020 
turned it into this tipo map its contour
map<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.470> it's<00:04:33.650> all<00:04:33.919> labels<00:04:34.490> starting<00:04:34.820> out<00:04:34.910> at

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
map so it's all labels starting out at

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.420 
map so it's all labels starting out at
an<00:04:35.210> inch<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.630> 7/8<00:04:37.000> thick<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:39.310> going<00:04:40.310> from

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
an inch and 7/8 thick and going from

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.219 
an inch and 7/8 thick and going from
there<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:42.789> let's<00:04:43.789> see<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.330> guess<00:04:46.659> that<00:04:47.659> so<00:04:48.080> the

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
there so let's see I guess that so the

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.540 
there so let's see I guess that so the
plans<00:04:48.500> are<00:04:50.080> 35<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:51.409> I<00:04:51.650> ship<00:04:51.860> those<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.340> two

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
plans are 35 and I ship those in a two

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.000 
plans are 35 and I ship those in a two
so<00:04:53.300> don't<00:04:53.870> get<00:04:53.960> those<00:04:54.169> folded<00:04:54.710> so<00:04:54.860> they're

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
so don't get those folded so they're

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.580 
so don't get those folded so they're
shipped<00:04:55.280> separate<00:04:55.760> up<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.630> DVD<00:04:57.139> it

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
shipped separate up the of the DVD it

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.680 
shipped separate up the of the DVD it
increases<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.430> shipping<00:04:58.880> cost<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.360> little<00:04:59.570> bit

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
increases the shipping cost a little bit

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.390 
increases the shipping cost a little bit
for<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.050> but<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.500> think<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.949> makes<00:05:01.099> for<00:05:01.340> a

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
for you but I think it makes for a

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.580 
for you but I think it makes for a
better<00:05:01.460> for<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.449> better<00:05:02.659> job<00:05:02.960> because<00:05:03.289> then<00:05:03.470> you

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
better for a better job because then you

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.980 
better for a better job because then you
get<00:05:03.770> your<00:05:03.979> your<00:05:04.460> plans<00:05:04.729> in<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:04.970> tube<00:05:05.240> they

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
get your your plans in a tube they

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.710 
get your your plans in a tube they
they're<00:05:06.740> easier<00:05:07.099> to<00:05:07.159> look<00:05:07.370> at<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.880> they're

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
they're easier to look at and they're

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.099 
they're easier to look at and they're
easier<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.139> store<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:11.479> I<00:05:11.720> guess<00:05:12.680> that's<00:05:12.830> it
