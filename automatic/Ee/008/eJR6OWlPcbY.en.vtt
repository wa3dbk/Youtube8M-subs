00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and I used about three and a half x

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.470 
and I used about three and a half x
because<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.680> wanted<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:51.000> big<00:00:51.210> hair

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.689 
because I wanted to get really big hair
so<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:53.780> liked<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:55.050> first<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:56.039> course<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so I liked it at first of course the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.010 
so I liked it at first of course the
older<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.260> more<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> liked<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> in<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
older got the more I liked it and in the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.280 
older got the more I liked it and in the
video<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.829> looks<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.210> reddish<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.170> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
video it looks more of a reddish but is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.990 
video it looks more of a reddish but is
actually<00:01:04.799> our<00:01:05.309> dark<00:01:05.610> burgundy<00:01:07.610> kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> hair

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
actually our dark burgundy kind of hair

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.020 
actually our dark burgundy kind of hair
and<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:12.110> it's<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.710> soft<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> package

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and it it's not as soft as the package

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.170 
and it it's not as soft as the package
indicates<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.220> bit<00:01:17.369> harder<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
indicates it's a little bit harder I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.850 
indicates it's a little bit harder I
guess<00:01:18.450> more<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.049> synthetic<00:01:19.890> blend<00:01:20.430> kind<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
guess more of a synthetic blend kind of

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.359 
guess more of a synthetic blend kind of
human<00:01:22.860> hair<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:24.500> guess<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.740> me<00:01:25.860> synthetic

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
human hair I guess with me synthetic

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.830 
human hair I guess with me synthetic
blend<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.909> more<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> human<00:01:27.450> hair

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
blend it would be more of a human hair

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
blend it would be more of a human hair
but<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.299> 20<00:01:30.540> dollars<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.960> wasn't

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

I<00:02:09.869> didn't<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.560> any<00:02:10.679> cutting<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:12.600> then<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
I didn't do any cutting to it and then I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.949 
I didn't do any cutting to it and then I
didn't<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:15.060> any<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:16.130> tracks<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:18.480> read

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
didn't do any of the tracks I just read

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.680 
didn't do any of the tracks I just read
it<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.319> Bend<00:02:19.920> old<00:02:20.190> flip<00:02:20.700> over<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> track<00:02:21.330> kept

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
it in Bend old flip over the track kept

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.720 
it in Bend old flip over the track kept
weaving<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.319> actually<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.069> did<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.459> some

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
weaving in actually I did do some

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.160 
weaving in actually I did do some
cutting<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.360> maybe<00:02:24.600> around<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.020> edges<00:02:27.170> just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
cutting like maybe around the edges just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.010 
cutting like maybe around the edges just
so<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.980> wouldn't<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> tracks<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.750> does

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
so you wouldn't see the tracks it does

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.949 
so you wouldn't see the tracks it does
have<00:02:31.230> an<00:02:31.350> ombre<00:02:31.830> effect<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.510> have

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
have an ombre effect so you can have

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.460 
have an ombre effect so you can have
