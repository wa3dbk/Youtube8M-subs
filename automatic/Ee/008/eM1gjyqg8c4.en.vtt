00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
get these for free but it's better to

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.450 
get these for free but it's better to
purchase<00:00:47.110> one<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.560> also<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:47.920> purchase<00:00:48.310> your

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
own hosting which we'll talk about in a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.260 
own hosting which we'll talk about in a
second<00:00:50.230> so<00:00:50.950> what<00:00:51.250> we<00:00:51.340> don't<00:00:51.550> want<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.850> see<00:00:52.030> is

your<00:01:14.770> domain<00:01:15.159> name<00:01:15.190> com<00:01:15.909> they<00:01:16.479> don't<00:01:16.630> have<00:01:16.690> to

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
your domain name com they don't have to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
worry about any of the extras and then

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.789 
worry about any of the extras and then
it's<00:01:18.880> clearly<00:01:19.420> written<00:01:19.570> easy<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.560> remember

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
it's clearly written easy to remember

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.840 
it's clearly written easy to remember
and<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:22.030> covers<00:01:22.450> your<00:01:22.750> domain<00:01:23.110> name<00:01:23.140> exactly

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and it covers your domain name exactly

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.160 
and it covers your domain name exactly
now<00:01:24.850> another<00:01:25.090> thing<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.420> consider<00:01:25.510> if<00:01:25.990> you're

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
now another thing to consider if you're

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.170 
now another thing to consider if you're
doing<00:01:26.380> niche<00:01:26.620> websites<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.460> trying<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.000> get

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
doing niche websites is trying to get

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.680 
doing niche websites is trying to get
the<00:01:28.990> exact<00:01:29.470> match<00:01:29.940> keyword<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.180> your<00:01:31.510> domain

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
the exact match keyword in your domain

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.960 
the exact match keyword in your domain
so<00:01:32.650> for<00:01:32.890> example<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.430> looks<00:01:33.640> something<00:01:33.850> like

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
so for example it looks something like

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.780 
so for example it looks something like
this<00:01:34.530> ww<00:01:35.940> keyword<00:01:36.940> com<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:38.170> if<00:01:38.320> you're<00:01:38.790> making

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
this ww keyword com so if you're making

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.840 
this ww keyword com so if you're making
website<00:01:40.210> about<00:01:40.420> tuna<00:01:41.020> fish<00:01:41.229> you'd<00:01:41.740> say<00:01:42.130> ww

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
tuna fish com the next thing we need

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.109 
tuna fish com the next thing we need
like<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.290> mentioned<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.890> web<00:01:48.100> hosting<00:01:48.640> now

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
like I mentioned is web hosting now

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.820 
like I mentioned is web hosting now
there's<00:01:49.330> free<00:01:49.570> hosting<00:01:50.080> but<00:01:50.320> again<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.710> get

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
there's free hosting but again you get

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.500 
there's free hosting but again you get
that<00:01:50.979> same<00:01:51.280> problem<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:51.970> don't<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.270> control

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
that same problem you don't have control

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.600 
that same problem you don't have control
over<00:01:52.750> your<00:01:53.020> site<00:01:53.320> often<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:54.220> can't<00:01:54.430> put

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
over your site often you can't put

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.450 
over your site often you can't put
advertising<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.689> you<00:01:56.170> get<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.350> long<00:01:56.650> URL<00:01:57.220> a
