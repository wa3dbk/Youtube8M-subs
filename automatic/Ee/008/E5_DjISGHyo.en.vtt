four<00:00:36.230> years<00:00:36.379> ago<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:36.829> suit<00:00:37.100> more<00:00:37.519> than

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
four years ago this suit more than

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.340 
four years ago this suit more than
likely<00:00:37.789> would<00:00:38.030> have<00:00:38.059> been<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.239> top-end<00:00:38.539> see<00:00:38.840> you

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
likely would have been a top-end see you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.410 
likely would have been a top-end see you
know<00:00:39.469> it's<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.920> technology<00:00:40.609> it's<00:00:41.300> got

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
know it's the technology it's got

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.410 
know it's the technology it's got
cheaper<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:41.989> easier<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.530> suffer<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:44.090> recreate

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
cheaper and easier to suffer to recreate

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.479 
cheaper and easier to suffer to recreate
and<00:00:44.690> using<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.410> lower<00:00:45.559> end<00:00:45.859> wetsuits<00:00:46.309> now

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
and using the lower end wetsuits now

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.759 
and using the lower end wetsuits now
basically<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:48.079> get<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.230> lot<00:00:48.379> of<00:00:48.440> wet<00:00:48.589> suit

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
basically so you get a lot of wet suit

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.770 
basically so you get a lot of wet suit
for<00:00:48.890> your<00:00:48.980> money<00:00:49.129> than<00:00:49.309> seeking<00:00:49.660> with<00:00:50.660> this

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
for your money than seeking with this

particular suit and starting on the top
something<00:00:54.050> that's<00:00:54.170> really<00:00:54.320> important<00:00:54.769> you've

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
something that's really important you've

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.290 
something that's really important you've
got<00:00:54.980> like<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.100> roll<00:00:55.370> neck<00:00:55.579> collar<00:00:55.940> which<00:00:56.179> is

got like a roll neck collar which is

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.430 
got like a roll neck collar which is
basically<00:00:56.570> mother's<00:00:56.870> two<00:00:57.050> pieces<00:00:57.410> of

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
basically mother's two pieces of

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.919 
basically mother's two pieces of
neoprene<00:00:57.890> on<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.789> inside<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.359> smooth<00:00:59.660> skin

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
neoprene on the inside is smooth skin

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.569 
neoprene on the inside is smooth skin
which<00:01:00.079> is<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:00.320> smooth<00:01:00.620> near<00:01:00.829> frame<00:01:01.070> which

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
which is like smooth near frame which

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.340 
which is like smooth near frame which
basically<00:01:01.940> means<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.480> it<00:01:02.600> stops<00:01:02.870> wetsuit

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
basically means that it stops wetsuit

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.140 
basically means that it stops wetsuit
rubber<00:01:03.620> up<00:01:03.859> on<00:01:04.040> your<00:01:04.159> neck<00:01:04.339> if<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.970> imagine

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
rubber up on your neck if you imagine

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.550 
rubber up on your neck if you imagine
those<00:01:05.510> two<00:01:05.750> little<00:01:05.900> bits<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.230> neoprene

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
those two little bits of neoprene

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.080 
those two little bits of neoprene
they've<00:01:06.830> sort<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.160> roll<00:01:07.310> separately<00:01:07.640> apart

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
they've sort of roll separately apart

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.820 
they've sort of roll separately apart
like<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.020> instead<00:01:09.230> of<00:01:09.290> moving<00:01:09.530> up<00:01:09.740> and

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
like that so instead of moving up and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.530 
like that so instead of moving up and
down<00:01:09.950> your<00:01:10.190> neck<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:10.580> creating<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:11.000> rash<00:01:11.240> which

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
down your neck and creating a rash which

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.480 
down your neck and creating a rash which
is<00:01:11.660> a<00:01:11.690> big<00:01:11.900> problem<00:01:12.160> they've<00:01:13.160> used<00:01:13.340> this

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
is a big problem they've used this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.400 
is a big problem they've used this
technology<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.240> basically<00:01:14.750> get<00:01:14.960> rid<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.200> that

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
technology to basically get rid of that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.560 
technology to basically get rid of that
issue<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.640> nice<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.180> comfortable

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
issue and so it's a nice and comfortable

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.810 
issue and so it's a nice and comfortable
around<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.870> neck<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.310> now<00:01:19.310> moving<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.730> bit

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
around the neck now now moving a bit

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.190 
around the neck now now moving a bit
further<00:01:20.030> down<00:01:20.150> you've<00:01:20.450> got<00:01:20.480> smooth<00:01:20.840> skin<00:01:21.080> on

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
further down you've got smooth skin on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.950 
further down you've got smooth skin on
chest<00:01:21.230> and<00:01:22.120> round<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.210> back<00:01:23.360> as<00:01:23.540> well<00:01:23.570> she's<00:01:23.930> a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
chest and round the back as well she's a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.570 
chest and round the back as well she's a
really<00:01:24.110> good<00:01:24.290> feature<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.280> sat<00:01:25.460> on<00:01:25.550> a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
really good feature you sat on a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.460 
really good feature you sat on a
surfboard<00:01:25.940> kiteboarding<00:01:26.810> or<00:01:27.050> windsurfing

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
surfboard kiteboarding or windsurfing

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.740 
surfboard kiteboarding or windsurfing
anything<00:01:27.830> like<00:01:27.980> that<00:01:28.010> basically<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:29.360> idea<00:01:29.390> of

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
anything like that basically the idea of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.750 
anything like that basically the idea of
the<00:01:29.810> smooth<00:01:30.140> skin<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:31.010> keep<00:01:31.160> out<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.580> wind

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
the smooth skin is to keep out the wind

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.430 
the smooth skin is to keep out the wind
penetration<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.720> don't<00:01:32.900> get<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.230> sort

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
penetration so you don't get that sort

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.290 
penetration so you don't get that sort
bitter<00:01:33.620> wind<00:01:33.950> in<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.220> winter<00:01:34.580> cutting

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
bitter wind in the winter cutting

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.550 
bitter wind in the winter cutting
through<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.660> suit<00:01:36.160> he<00:01:37.160> seems<00:01:37.820> on<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.560> only

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
through the suit he seems on the only

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.620 
through the suit he seems on the only
epic<00:01:39.920> or<00:01:40.070> all<00:01:40.190> glued<00:01:40.430> by<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:40.910> stitched<00:01:41.210> which

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
epic or all glued by and stitched which

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.150 
epic or all glued by and stitched which
basically<00:01:42.020> means<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.740> stitching

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
basically means that the stitching

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.370 
basically means that the stitching
doesn't<00:01:43.370> get<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.580> whole<00:01:43.730> way<00:01:43.880> through<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.020> you

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
doesn't get the whole way through so you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.930 
doesn't get the whole way through so you
haven't<00:01:45.680> seen<00:01:45.980> going<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.310> whole<00:01:46.430> way<00:01:46.640> through

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
haven't seen going a whole way through

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.370 
haven't seen going a whole way through
so<00:01:47.150> essentially<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:47.690> stops<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.200> water

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
so essentially that stops the water

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.800 
so essentially that stops the water
flushing<00:01:48.860> through<00:01:49.010> your<00:01:49.160> suit<00:01:49.540> which<00:01:50.540> gives

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
flushing through your suit which gives

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.660 
flushing through your suit which gives
it<00:01:50.930> is<00:01:51.410> that<00:01:51.620> extra<00:01:51.920> add<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> bit<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.340> warmth

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
it is that extra add a bit of warmth

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.370 
it is that extra add a bit of warmth
basically<00:01:53.150> keeps<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.570> warm<00:01:53.900> water<00:01:54.110> that's

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
basically keeps the warm water that's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.930 
basically keeps the warm water that's
already<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> suit<00:01:55.070> against<00:01:55.700> your<00:01:55.820> body

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
already in the suit against your body

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.120 
already in the suit against your body
stops<00:01:56.630> getting<00:01:56.810> at<00:01:56.960> any<00:01:57.110> cold<00:01:57.410> water<00:01:57.710> getting

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
stops getting at any cold water getting

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.630 
stops getting at any cold water getting
through<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:59.270> keep<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.200> warm<00:02:00.440> if<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.490> look

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
through to keep you warm if you look

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.760 
through to keep you warm if you look
further<00:02:01.790> down<00:02:01.940> you've<00:02:02.630> got<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.020> duraflex

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
further down you've got the duraflex

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.620 
further down you've got the duraflex
knee<00:02:04.070> pants<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.670> by<00:02:04.760> duraflex<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.540> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
knee pants and by duraflex is just the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.199 
knee pants and by duraflex is just the
material<00:02:06.080> they<00:02:06.230> use<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.860> basically<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.520> lot<00:02:08.119> of

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
material they use and basically a lot of

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.059 
material they use and basically a lot of
problems<00:02:08.479> people<00:02:08.810> wearing<00:02:09.530> through<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
problems people wearing through on the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.680 
problems people wearing through on the
knees<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.429> suits<00:02:10.670> especially<00:02:11.180> mess<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.450> duck

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
knees of suits especially mess of duck

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.430 
knees of suits especially mess of duck
diving<00:02:12.080> on

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
diving on

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.860 
diving on
bored<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.030> foot<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.300> other<00:02:14.420> needs<00:02:14.660> to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
bored so the foot this other needs to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.410 
bored so the foot this other needs to
give<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.440> suit<00:02:16.010> more<00:02:16.220> longevity<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.090> more

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
give the suit more longevity and more

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.350 
give the suit more longevity and more
durability<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.230> knees<00:02:18.380> it's<00:02:19.250> 53<00:02:19.940> wetsuit

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
durability on the knees it's 53 wetsuit

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.180 
durability on the knees it's 53 wetsuit
which<00:02:20.480> basically<00:02:20.840> means<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.380> majority<00:02:22.160> of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
which basically means the majority of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.640 
which basically means the majority of
the<00:02:22.310> soup<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.760> 5<00:02:23.330> mil<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.630> neoprene<00:02:24.080> keep<00:02:24.560> you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the soup is 5 mil of neoprene keep you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.520 
the soup is 5 mil of neoprene keep you
nice<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:24.830> toasty<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.810> places<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
nice and toasty but on places like the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.010 
nice and toasty but on places like the
arms<00:02:27.920> they<00:02:28.130> use<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> 3<00:02:28.700> mil<00:02:28.910> neoprene<00:02:29.450> which

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
arms they use a 3 mil neoprene which

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.310 
arms they use a 3 mil neoprene which
basically<00:02:30.320> gives<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.770> more<00:02:31.210> flexibility

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
basically gives you more flexibility

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.540 
basically gives you more flexibility
allows<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.500> soup<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.830> fit<00:02:34.010> your<00:02:34.100> body<00:02:34.250> better

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
allows the soup to fit your body better

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.220 
allows the soup to fit your body better
gives<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.270> more<00:02:35.420> flexibility<00:02:35.960> so<00:02:36.140> when

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
gives you more flexibility so when

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.900 
gives you more flexibility so when
you're<00:02:36.350> paddling<00:02:36.560> kitesurfing<00:02:37.430> anything

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
you're paddling kitesurfing anything

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.030 
you're paddling kitesurfing anything
like<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.060> you're<00:02:38.720> going<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.960> have<00:02:39.080> going<00:02:39.980> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
like that you're going to have going to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.860 
like that you're going to have going to
expend<00:02:40.370> less<00:02:40.550> energy<00:02:41.000> basically<00:02:41.630> because<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
expend less energy basically because the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.540 
expend less energy basically because the
suit<00:02:42.170> won't<00:02:42.320> be<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.620> thick<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.010> restrictive

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
suit won't be is thick and restrictive

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.700 
suit won't be is thick and restrictive
and<00:02:44.140> essentially<00:02:45.140> that's<00:02:45.320> pretty<00:02:45.620> much

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
and essentially that's pretty much

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.320 
and essentially that's pretty much
everything<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.850> o'neill<00:02:47.150> and

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
everything going on on the o'neill and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.260 
everything going on on the o'neill and
pick<00:02:47.510> ladies<00:02:47.810> epic<00:02:48.310> 2010<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.880> what<00:02:50.030> we<00:02:50.120> don't

year as we said before glue and blind
stitching<00:03:07.850> I'll<00:03:08.090> get<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.300> little<00:03:08.360> bit<00:03:08.570> closer

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
stitching I'll get a little bit closer

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.600 
stitching I'll get a little bit closer
for<00:03:08.990> you<00:03:09.080> can<00:03:09.320> see<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.530> that's<00:03:10.190> basically

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
for you can see that that's basically

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
for you can see that that's basically
what<00:03:10.790> we're<00:03:10.910> talking<00:03:11.180> about<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.450> seam

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
what we're talking about the seam

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.510 
what we're talking about the seam
doesn't<00:03:11.750> go<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.080> whole<00:03:12.200> way<00:03:12.260> through<00:03:12.620> these

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
doesn't go the whole way through these

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.730 
doesn't go the whole way through these
little<00:03:13.790> dots<00:03:13.940> here<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.360> basically<00:03:14.780> taping<00:03:15.590> on

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
little dots here are basically taping on

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.020 
little dots here are basically taping on
the<00:03:15.860> stress<00:03:16.130> points<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.580> bits<00:03:16.730> where<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
the stress points the bits where the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.090 
the stress points the bits where the
suit<00:03:17.239> pulls<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.780> seams<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.770> idea<00:03:18.860> that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
suit pulls the seams and the idea that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.430 
suit pulls the seams and the idea that
is<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.480> basically<00:03:20.480> stopping<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.989> suit<00:03:21.170> pulling

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
is a basically stopping the suit pulling

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.840 
is a basically stopping the suit pulling
apart<00:03:21.530> at<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:21.920> seams<00:03:22.220> which<00:03:22.459> used<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.700> be<00:03:22.820> a

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
apart at the seams which used to be a

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.949 
apart at the seams which used to be a
problems<00:03:23.239> that's<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.540> way<00:03:23.660> lives<00:03:23.840> of

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
problems that's the way lives of

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.350 
problems that's the way lives of
counteracted<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.800> this<00:03:25.520> red<00:03:25.790> material<00:03:26.120> was

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
counteracted that this red material was

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.360 
counteracted that this red material was
really<00:03:26.600> important<00:03:27.050> this<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.380> great<00:03:28.130> feature

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
really important this is a great feature

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.130 
really important this is a great feature
like<00:03:28.700> as<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> saying<00:03:29.239> entry<00:03:29.510> level<00:03:29.780> suit<00:03:29.959> before

would normally never have had any of
these<00:03:32.300> soft<00:03:32.570> features<00:03:32.750> there's<00:03:33.140> really<00:03:33.470> sort

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
these soft features there's really sort

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.160 
these soft features there's really sort
of<00:03:33.830> plane<00:03:34.130> basically<00:03:34.760> neoprene<00:03:35.450> seams<00:03:35.870> and

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
of plane basically neoprene seams and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.160 
of plane basically neoprene seams and
you<00:03:36.620> get<00:03:36.800> we<00:03:36.920> pay<00:03:37.130> for<00:03:37.160> basically<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:37.940> now

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
you get we pay for basically but now

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.229 
you get we pay for basically but now
even<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.530> entry-level<00:03:39.830> suits<00:03:40.310> you've<00:03:40.970> got<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
even in entry-level suits you've got the

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.910 
even in entry-level suits you've got the
polypro<00:03:41.750> firewall<00:03:42.260> material<00:03:42.769> which<00:03:42.890> is

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
polypro firewall material which is

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.770 
polypro firewall material which is
essentially<00:03:43.489> like<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.670> thermal<00:03:44.120> rash<00:03:44.300> vest<00:03:44.600> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
essentially like a thermal rash vest it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.180 
essentially like a thermal rash vest it
just<00:03:44.959> holds<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.380> heat<00:03:45.560> against<00:03:45.950> your<00:03:46.040> body

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
just holds the heat against your body

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.550 
just holds the heat against your body
and<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.940> makes<00:03:47.209> a<00:03:47.330> real<00:03:47.630> marked<00:03:48.080> noticeable

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
and it makes a real marked noticeable

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.560 
and it makes a real marked noticeable
difference<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.790> wetsuit<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.300> keep<00:03:50.450> you

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
difference on on a wetsuit to keep you

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.790 
difference on on a wetsuit to keep you
warm<00:03:50.810> especially<00:03:51.380> in<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.500> sort<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.709> the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
warm especially in the sort of the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.190 
warm especially in the sort of the
depths<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.220> winter<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:53.300> I'm<00:03:53.540> basically

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
depths of winter so I'm basically

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.259 
depths of winter so I'm basically
getting<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.800> huge<00:03:55.070> amount<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.489> suit<00:03:55.970> for<00:03:56.120> your

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
money these days as you see they got the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.830 
money these days as you see they got the
wrong<00:03:57.769> at<00:03:57.920> collabera<00:03:58.250> game<00:03:58.720> you've<00:03:59.720> got

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
wrong at collabera game you've got

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.300 
wrong at collabera game you've got
minimal<00:04:00.140> amount<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.440> their<00:04:00.709> panels<00:04:01.190> of

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
minimal amount of their panels of

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.270 
minimal amount of their panels of
neoprene<00:04:01.670> as<00:04:01.910> well<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.420> it's<00:04:03.350> it's<00:04:03.800> cheaper

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
neoprene as well so it's it's cheaper

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.370 
neoprene as well so it's it's cheaper
for<00:04:04.310> wetsuit<00:04:04.760> companies<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.390> use<00:04:05.420> more<00:04:06.019> pieces

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
for wetsuit companies to use more pieces

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.570 
for wetsuit companies to use more pieces
of<00:04:06.410> neoprene<00:04:06.769> because<00:04:07.010> they<00:04:07.130> can<00:04:07.250> get<00:04:07.370> more

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
of neoprene because they can get more

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.370 
of neoprene because they can get more
suits<00:04:07.940> out<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.330> cuts<00:04:08.570> neoprene<00:04:09.019> that<00:04:09.260> they

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
suits out of the cuts neoprene that they

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.220 
suits out of the cuts neoprene that they
have<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.400> am<00:04:10.610> for<00:04:11.239> this<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.510> have<00:04:11.630> first<00:04:12.050> of

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
have so am for this to have first of

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.110 
have so am for this to have first of
lower<00:04:12.800> end<00:04:13.040> suit<00:04:13.280> or<00:04:13.400> an<00:04:13.459> entry<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:13.700> suit<00:04:14.090> to

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
have such few pieces of neoprene is

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.800 
have such few pieces of neoprene is
really<00:04:16.609> good<00:04:16.760> because<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:17.060> stops<00:04:17.330> again<00:04:17.450> any

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
really good because it stops again any

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.090 
really good because it stops again any
water<00:04:18.080> penetration<00:04:18.680> to

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
water penetration to

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.100 
water penetration to
suit<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.490> makes<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.150> suit<00:04:20.330> more<00:04:20.510> flexible<00:04:20.959> as

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
suit and makes the suit more flexible as

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.520 
suit and makes the suit more flexible as
well<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:22.190> essentially<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.720> that's

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
well so essentially that is it that's

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.880 
well so essentially that is it that's
the<00:04:24.740> o'neill<00:04:25.280> ladies<00:04:25.790> epic<00:04:26.180> for<00:04:26.360> 2010<00:04:27.290> which
