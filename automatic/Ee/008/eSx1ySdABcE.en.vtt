00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.520
 You want to know what happened in 1702 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.520
 can do everything and then take a look 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.760
 the 32 has seven different ones 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.230
 set up functions that one catches when 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.360
 now itself and ends at 1702 on 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 Just turn it on here 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.350
 and then we have the smallest light 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:06.100
 and then always increases with everyone 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 turn and a wheel until 1702 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.600
 then it's also one very soon 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.539

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:23.440
 in the 1700 and two flowers mode stops you 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.310
 still one and a half hours in the strobo 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.940
 it's two that's it 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.350
 powerful as before , the whole thing with one 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.929
 xml two led the thing has power right 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.690
 which is really stylish like me 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.610
 think this chrome plated ring is yes 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.600
 is actually from copper and to the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.430
 dissipate heat 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.509
 when the flashlight namely at the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.770
 full power of 1007 us thinks follower 12 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.729
 Of course it will be really warm 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.280
 and here it is just that the protection 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.650
 this ring protects the batteries 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.689
 in the back is when all over 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.909
 80 degrees comes she turns 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.350
 Automatically off that if they except 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.869
 if you're backpacking for him 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.579
 and by using your memory effect 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.230
 previously entered or penetrate 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.900
 do not leave menu genuine backpack 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.829
 flames pretty horny thing so many 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.100
 Of course , farmers also need that 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.600
 right here is all batteries 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.970
 collected in a magazine with three 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.160
 batteries 3400 milliamps for comparison 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.390
 this is now normal double a 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.930
 battery from the others 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.630
 flashlights knows nonetheless 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:39.750
 you can all here this 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.230
 Supplied charger itself auto 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.740
 charge 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.210
 that means you will remain independent 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.040
 you can already wrestle through the dense one 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.770
 guess that the whole on a certain 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.920
 Water resistance has in the case it is 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.600
 according to the ips standard 8 that means you 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.680
 So you can be quiet even in the rain 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.959
 No problem walking at all 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.190

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.959
 See what the part really can 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.640
 I got a sponge 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.640
 probably with a nice corner out 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.930
 Solution glass and the flashlight 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.000
 before that, I was told to smith me 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.480
