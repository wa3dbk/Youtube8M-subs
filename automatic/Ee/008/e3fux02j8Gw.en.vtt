00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 welcome everyone today i want to show 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 you my dad's hunting knife is ours 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.369
 homemade made by his own 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.930
 hands quite interesting in my opinion 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.109
 Well, as if on the one hand, it seems to be 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.120
 nothing special but on the other hand 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:39.530
 pretty nice metal knife here 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:44.700
 some kind of stainless steel that could test 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:49.110
 take out from the factory so let's say of course 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.190
 here, too, not everything is perfect particular here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.460
 descending licked here date here 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.460
 considered not very professional 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:11.220
 peasants handle lining here floor tank 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.509
 cover plate made of PCB riveted 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.460
 white metal to me in particular here 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.960
 like to give and notch very carefully 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.530
 in my opinion made very comfortable knife 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 lies in hand 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:42.890
 blade length is 15 centimeters width 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.010
 3 centimeters from this place three 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.350
 a centimeter down about two thirds 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.510
 blade thickness is made but generally section 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.320
 blade rum 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.950
 if so you can see rom that is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:06.020
 here everything is also reduced in the form of mince 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.820
 the blade is made here here is the stuffing at all 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.890
 blade thickness 5 millimeters i.e. 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.400
 fat night dough want to be hunted 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.709
 bring back the hour is no longer hunting hunted 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.190
 small game hare duck knife used 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:30.350
 for dobor never cut a game on 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:36.350
 the place has always been doing this mother- in -law knife 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.570
 for some reason and sharpened it for some reason 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.700
 only this part is part 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.239
 almost dull you are the more or less 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:49.430
 sharp well i guess so just 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.850
 when an animal is pruned mostly 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.680
 still used here is this place 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.980
 can certainly not mistaken but it seems to be 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.980
 So 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.269
 of particular interest is this 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:13.799
 I do not know the detail will not be visible here here 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:16.439
 such a bump and a side of this bump 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.739
 as far as I understand it is used in 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.510
 As a castle, you can of course 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.340
 also do not represent anything interesting 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.849
 this skin is wrapped with electrical tape and this one 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.079
 tubercle it serves as a lock then 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:39.120
 there he slows down the friction creates 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:44.549
 resistance when you need to invest in 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:49.680
 need and some point here as if 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:53.430
 goes as narrowly narrowly with export 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.139
 enters the knife in the sheath but since this 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:02.669
 places there are some definite 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:05.659
 expansion this bump pops up there 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:09.989
 this expansion and back it does not give the knife 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:15.299
 fall out he walks no need go up 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:22.289
 Cheholchik enters but does not fall out and so 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:27.419
 I donâ€™t know this either. 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:30.070
 it seems quite an interesting thing here 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.620
 such a knife 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.460
 what a hole for like kings for 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.870
 strap is generally very pleasant to the touch 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.070
 on the look of my test there are several on the same 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.690
 this is the biggest they are all homemade 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.300
 the knife and here already quite a while was not used 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.300
 but at least a year or more 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.700
 broken slightly 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:11.259
 the emphasis here is solid just cut out 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:11.259
 metal such a knife 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.310
 Thank you for your attention to new meetings
