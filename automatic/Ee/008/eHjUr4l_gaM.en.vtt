individually with sand as you can see

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.750 
individually with sand as you can see
takes<00:00:34.539> time<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.199> makes<00:00:35.829> them<00:00:36.010> very<00:00:36.219> heavy<00:00:36.550> and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
takes time and makes them very heavy and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.209 
takes time and makes them very heavy and
difficult<00:00:37.089> for<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.690> worker<00:00:38.019> to<00:00:38.170> move<00:00:38.379> the

once again this takes time and people
and<00:01:48.999> money<00:01:49.479> which<00:01:50.020> not<00:01:50.289> only<00:01:50.320> proves<00:01:50.799> costly

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
and money which not only proves costly

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.639 
and money which not only proves costly
to<00:01:51.369> councils<00:01:51.909> but<00:01:52.299> also<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.929> the<00:01:53.020> environment

synthetic sandbags work very effectively
first<00:03:54.650> thing<00:03:54.860> is<00:03:55.010> they're<00:03:55.489> light<00:03:55.820> and<00:03:56.150> easy<00:03:56.450> to

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
first thing is they're light and easy to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.690 
first thing is they're light and easy to
use

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
use

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.610 
use
and<00:03:57.790> first<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.630> all<00:03:58.690> they<00:03:58.870> deployed<00:03:59.290> quite

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
and first of all they deployed quite

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.610 
and first of all they deployed quite
quickly<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.520> much<00:04:00.700> more<00:04:00.910> user-friendly<00:04:01.620> our

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
quickly and much more user-friendly our

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.260 
quickly and much more user-friendly our
one<00:04:02.860> of<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.010> things<00:04:03.160> we<00:04:03.340> do<00:04:03.520> like<00:04:03.550> about<00:04:03.910> them

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
one of the things we do like about them

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.850 
one of the things we do like about them
is<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:04.540> they<00:04:04.690> have<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> very<00:04:05.080> long<00:04:05.290> shelf<00:04:05.590> life

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
is that they have a very long shelf life

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.089 
is that they have a very long shelf life
so<00:04:06.610> one<00:04:07.270> can<00:04:07.510> store<00:04:07.810> them<00:04:08.080> provided<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.860> kept

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
so one can store them provided the kept

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.250 
so one can store them provided the kept
in<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.340> original<00:04:09.700> plastic<00:04:10.120> bag<00:04:10.420> for<00:04:11.050> quite<00:04:11.230> a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
in the original plastic bag for quite a

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.620 
in the original plastic bag for quite a
number<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.620> years<00:04:11.860> hydrotech<00:04:12.819> is<00:04:12.970> much<00:04:13.270> easier

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
number of years hydrotech is much easier

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.449 
number of years hydrotech is much easier
to<00:04:13.660> handle<00:04:13.900> anybody<00:04:14.770> can<00:04:14.950> handle<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.340> put

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
to handle anybody can handle it and put

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.940 
to handle anybody can handle it and put
a<00:04:15.489> position<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.570> can<00:04:16.840> be<00:04:16.900> hydrated<00:04:17.829> with<00:04:17.919> water

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
a position it can be hydrated with water

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.479 
a position it can be hydrated with water
very<00:04:18.790> easily<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.540> not<00:04:20.410> only<00:04:20.590> does<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:20.980> protect

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
very easily and not only does it protect

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.280 
very easily and not only does it protect
the<00:04:21.850> house<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.330> front<00:04:22.540> of<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.720> door<00:04:22.930> from

water getting in

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.150 
water getting in
it<00:04:25.300> could<00:04:25.480> also<00:04:25.660> absorb<00:04:26.560> water<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:27.040> any

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
it could also absorb water of any

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.129 
it could also absorb water of any
leaking<00:04:27.550> getting<00:04:27.760> faster<00:04:28.150> just<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.630> door<00:04:28.840> and
