00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.330
 Welcome back friends right away i 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.259
 its gaming again unboxing in fact 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.960
 I got carried away 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.150
 from the offer of the moment which was the uil 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.599
 you wii party 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.279
 practically if you're lucky inside 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.119
 I think tomorrow, so I'm telling you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 the last one makes an offertona and the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.449
 you can find at a price lower than 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.929
 200 euros 179 so you can have the wii 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.620
 u basic for pac as well as the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.829
 they call tech wii party yukon 8 gigabytes 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.719
 is a whole series of things inside plus two 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.690
 play then we will discard it now 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.370
 we will do an unboxing I remember that I do not 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 I do it by profession then the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 situation there is a little precarious and on 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.969
 read and did not choose their copies 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.930
 said do already already provides the questions 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.699
 disturbing, however, the light there 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.329
 situation in the light is as it is 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.309
 so in short you must enjoy yourself 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's say the lack of professionalism of my parents 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.180
 unboxing then how can you see where 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.050
 the box is pretty and pretty 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.030
 I must say all in all it is also small 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.250
 I expected it to come with let's say a 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.100
 much larger package but is denied 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.210
 definitely small then let's try 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.270
 we begin to discard it and see that 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.110
 what's inside 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.930
 then first a vague born as you can 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.899
 see there are wii party games 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.360
 you on a barcode so I can 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.660
 give in any time a 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.250
 any house as you can see, in short, there is 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.410
 a nice code is worth 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.080
 usually the bundles remove the code a 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.910
 bars technically fail 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.330
 to give her inside we are here and nintendo 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.030
 naturally makes it as you know the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.770
 nintendo is also this with a code a 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.400
 barre is one of those houses that you don't 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.200
 allows streaming of his 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.930
 then nintendo video games 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.239
 it will be difficult to show you some 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.670
 games I can show you others not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.630
 these are this i think it is door for 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.030
 the batteries I think of the loses a piece of 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.560
 which I would do even less and therefore 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.920
 things are starting to arrive 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.390
 finally hdmi also nintendo entered 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.400
 in the world of high definition 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.400
 the usual kind of money 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.190
 the manuals of 45,000 pages on remote 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.230
 control and excuse the command that is 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.170
 equal to that of the normal wii of 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.600
 made wii motionplus side with already the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.330
 plastichina is seen but the plastichina 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.540
 to say to protect it from various 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.040
 falls that will surely occur though 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.940
 as you can see there is this plastichina 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.430
 sorry this white plastichina 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.440
 in short, it smells good of plastic 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:28.660
 new this is the bar for movements 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:31.180
 that in charge the power supply which is one 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.430
 probably great stuff almost at 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.310
 level of the xbox meklau di 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.800
 what the hell who knows what a 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.989
 other food and pad feeders with 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.380
 I would like a boiata championship 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.959
 from the indicator and first first male 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.959
 couple of second 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.959
 a console then the console this 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.200
 track 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.359
 I have to say I was expecting a little more from 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.709
 I never had the image 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:11.189
 measured between white very tamarra like 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.189
 I like it 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.120
 here we see the revenue for the sd that is 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.949
 this here two entries for usb key e 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.320
 the ex power 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.669
 okay sorry was not very centered it 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.570
 I show sd from 2 usb a lot of 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.639
 air intakes back there is a command 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.960
 which will be for the hdmi sensor 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:43.020
 the other two usb power adapter just right for 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.880
 give you an idea of ​​how big I would like 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.330
 I'm gone because I brought it 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.050
 of hand 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.570
 this is a 360 excuse me 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.060
 and this is nintendo wii u then 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.320
 quite small rivulets now 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.950
 we place the s60 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.200
 here we are 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:08.120
 then those this is a let's say one 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.060
 console now we get the comparison 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:17.540
 very tamarro all white as you like 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:23.710

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.710
 put perfect with the volume 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.880
 where I walk and I don't see well 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.210
 not even the Apennines what should 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.170
 be put on the life charger idea 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:42.780
 that is, to be right to make people understand is 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:45.430
 big enough and hopefully not 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.390
 reflect will be I had to put the image 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.990
 of the troll and nothing this is a boxing 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:56.280

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.560
 sorry parts wii party you basic tech is 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.840
 a series of appointments the next 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.030
 probably if we find games that 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.840
 we can exhaust even call with 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.070
 this console 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.030
 otherwise it will remain so bye
