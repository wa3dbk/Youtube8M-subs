would you flour paste really putting it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.919 
would you flour paste really putting it
on<00:00:28.980> baking<00:00:29.369> paper<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:29.849> well<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
on baking paper as well can see it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.340 
on baking paper as well can see it
already<00:00:31.679> marzipan<00:00:32.460> my<00:00:32.820> learn<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
already marzipan my learn on to the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:49.720 
already marzipan my learn on to the
second<00:00:34.739> young<00:00:35.270> make<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.420> 14<00:00:36.750> furnish<00:00:37.200> here

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730

I'll<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:50.540> keep<00:00:50.780> rolling<00:00:51.260> it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:11.990 

really<00:00:58.370> easy<00:00:58.609> to<00:00:58.969> work<00:00:58.999> with

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.340 

come<00:01:13.000> be<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.210> panther<00:01:13.570> we're<00:01:13.870> doing<00:01:14.050> around

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
come be a panther we're doing around

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.920 
come be a panther we're doing around
shake<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.820> long<00:01:19.000> as<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.150> get<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.330> main<00:01:19.570> part

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
shake as long as you get the main part

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:39.840 
shake as long as you get the main part
until<00:01:20.290> then<00:01:20.440> you<00:01:20.470> can<00:01:20.680> point<00:01:20.890> out<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.190> answer

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.890 

so<00:01:43.710> what<00:01:44.710> we're<00:01:44.830> going<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.040> do<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.400> cake<00:01:45.900> is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
so what we're going to do to the cake is

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.800 
so what we're going to do to the cake is
going<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.650> put<00:01:47.799> some<00:01:47.830> new<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.610> calm<00:01:49.180> down<00:01:49.299> I've

and you just brush that on it's going to
make<00:01:56.470> marzipan<00:01:58.470> attach<00:01:59.470> better<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.250> it's

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
make marzipan attach better and it's

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.440 
make marzipan attach better and it's
also<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.229> give<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.560> bit<00:02:02.680> more<00:02:03.479> flavor

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:16.210 
that's just amazing I hope looks a
little<00:03:00.500> baking<00:03:01.069> paper<00:03:01.310> sleepy<00:03:02.060> life<00:03:04.840> easily

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.920 

Mayo<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.760> top<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.210> you've<00:03:21.480> seen<00:03:21.780> this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
Mayo the top so that you've seen this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.310 
Mayo the top so that you've seen this
bits<00:03:22.260> where<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:24.180> can<00:03:24.360> get<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.570> bit<00:03:24.720> off<00:03:24.960> and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
bits where you can get a bit off and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.200 
bits where you can get a bit off and
still<00:03:25.620> push<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.010> down<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.490> can<00:03:26.640> save<00:03:26.910> these

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
still push it down you can save these

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.540 
still push it down you can save these
bits<00:03:27.510> because<00:03:27.690> then<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:27.990> you<00:03:28.080> come<00:03:28.550> round

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
bits because then if you come round

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.140 
bits because then if you come round
there<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.210> see<00:03:30.240> you've<00:03:30.690> got<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:32.150> it's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
there you can see you've got you it's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.990 
there you can see you've got you it's
not<00:03:33.270> about<00:03:33.420> actually<00:03:34.280> what<00:03:35.280> many<00:03:35.460> bits<00:03:35.730> there

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
not about actually what many bits there

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:52.480 
not about actually what many bits there
are<00:03:36.330> creepers<00:03:39.680> so

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.310 

so<00:03:53.150> we're<00:03:53.270> going<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.480> be<00:03:53.540> covered<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:53.930> ice<00:03:54.080> in

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
so we're going to be covered in ice in

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.880 
so we're going to be covered in ice in
any<00:03:54.530> way<00:03:54.680> sir

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890
