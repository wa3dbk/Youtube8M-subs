00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
stuck it right between there so it's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.140 
stuck it right between there so it's
right<00:02:48.330> between<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:49.700> near<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.940> wheel<00:02:51.500> and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150

right between like near the wheel and
the<00:02:54.410> swing<00:02:55.410> arm<00:02:56.210> so<00:02:57.210> when<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.750> turn<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.460> is

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
the swing arm so when you turn it is

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.420 
the swing arm so when you turn it is
that<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.120> should<00:03:00.540> hold<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.040> now

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that and that should hold it now

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.220 
that and that should hold it now
what<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.910> did<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:05.959> put<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:07.230> there<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:07.739> and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
what I did I put it on there like so and

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.420 
what I did I put it on there like so and
then<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.380> use<00:03:11.989> one<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.020> these<00:03:13.250> if<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.310> can

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
then you use one of these if you can

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.710 
then you use one of these if you can
find<00:03:14.820> on<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> pole<00:03:15.390> for<00:03:15.690> leverage<00:03:17.390> slide<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.600> up

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
find on a pole for leverage slide it up

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.420 
find on a pole for leverage slide it up
on<00:03:18.930> here<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:21.709> then<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.860> take<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.250> off

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
on here like so and then you take it off

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.770 
on here like so and then you take it off
now<00:03:23.820> when<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:24.989> threaded<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:27.209> should<00:03:27.510> come

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
now when this is threaded it should come

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.010 
now when this is threaded it should come
off<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.230> regular<00:03:28.739> nuts<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:30.209> way<00:03:30.450> I'll<00:03:30.959> show

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
off like regular nuts this way I'll show

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.500 
off like regular nuts this way I'll show
you<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.360> how<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.690> comes<00:03:33.900> off<00:03:34.080> this<00:03:34.440> way

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
you this is how it comes off this way

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.759 
you this is how it comes off this way
that's<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.660> direction<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.230> should<00:03:37.560> come

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
that's the direction that should come

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.610 
that's the direction that should come
off<00:03:41.300> okay

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.630 

and<00:03:45.160> then<00:03:45.340> bingo<00:03:46.650> now<00:03:47.650> when<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.310> put<00:03:48.489> this

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
and then bingo now when you put this

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.420 
and then bingo now when you put this
back<00:03:48.700> all<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.390> again

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
back all on again

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.580 
back all on again
I'd<00:03:51.430> advise<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.209> put<00:03:52.420> some<00:03:52.629> lock<00:03:53.019> thread<00:03:53.379> on

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
I'd advise to put some lock thread on

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.830 
I'd advise to put some lock thread on
here<00:03:54.040> put<00:03:54.879> this<00:03:55.030> back<00:03:55.300> on<00:03:55.569> and<00:03:55.900> just<00:03:57.150> do<00:03:58.150> redo

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
here put this back on and just do redo

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.540 
here put this back on and just do redo
whatever<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.379> did<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.709> take<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.069> off<00:04:00.220> and

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
whatever you did to take it off and

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.610 
whatever you did to take it off and
that's<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.540> that's<00:04:01.690> how<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:01.989> take<00:04:02.319> off<00:04:02.590> a

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
that's it that's how you take off a

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.250 
that's it that's how you take off a
front<00:04:03.040> sprocket<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:04.090> then<00:04:04.660> in<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.870> tighten

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
front sprocket and then in the tighten

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.250 
front sprocket and then in the tighten
it<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:06.090> counterclockwise<00:04:08.459> take<00:04:09.459> not<00:04:10.030> off<00:04:10.260> it's

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
it is counterclockwise take not off it's

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.490 
it is counterclockwise take not off it's
counterclockwise<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:14.049> should<00:04:14.230> be<00:04:14.379> it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
counterclockwise and that should be it

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.069 
counterclockwise and that should be it
and<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.879> rest<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.239> guys<00:04:16.510> should<00:04:16.720> be<00:04:16.810> able<00:04:16.989> to
