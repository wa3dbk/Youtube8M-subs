00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.110 
Happy New Year this is my first video
for<00:00:07.200> 2014<00:00:08.200> and<00:00:08.769> I<00:00:09.160> thought<00:00:09.400> I'd<00:00:09.550> start<00:00:09.790> it<00:00:10.000> with

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
for 2014 and I thought I'd start it with

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.300 
for 2014 and I thought I'd start it with
the<00:00:10.150> change<00:00:10.480> it's<00:00:10.750> just<00:00:10.810> a<00:00:11.260> color<00:00:11.770> of<00:00:11.890> you<00:00:12.070> and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.310 
the change it's just a color of you and

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.109 
the change it's just a color of you and
I<00:00:13.270> have<00:00:14.080> decided<00:00:14.470> to<00:00:14.830> add<00:00:15.280> lavender<00:00:15.670> to<00:00:16.000> my

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
I have decided to add lavender to my

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.380 
I have decided to add lavender to my
hair<00:00:16.330> I<00:00:16.510> usually<00:00:17.020> go<00:00:17.170> for<00:00:17.199> pink<00:00:17.529> so<00:00:18.279> I<00:00:18.759> thought

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
hair I usually go for pink so I thought

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.919 
hair I usually go for pink so I thought
why<00:00:19.509> not<00:00:19.570> have<00:00:19.779> a<00:00:19.810> changed<00:00:20.140> lambda<00:00:20.499> is<00:00:20.710> really

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:21.929 
why not have a changed lambda is really

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.239 
why not have a changed lambda is really
the<00:00:22.929> color<00:00:23.169> to<00:00:23.320> go<00:00:23.439> for<00:00:23.470> at<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.769> moment<00:00:23.800> it

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:24.249 
the color to go for at the moment it

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.630 
the color to go for at the moment it
seems<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:25.019> used<00:00:26.019> crazy<00:00:26.380> color<00:00:26.710> by<00:00:26.949> Rimbaud<00:00:27.429> so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
seems I used crazy color by Rimbaud so

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.810 
seems I used crazy color by Rimbaud so

I<00:01:27.759> believe<00:01:28.509> superdrug<00:01:28.990> do<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.259> as<00:01:29.409> well<00:01:29.619> I'll

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
I believe superdrug do it as well I'll

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.139 
I believe superdrug do it as well I'll
do<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.130> close-up<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.579> that<00:01:30.729> so<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.909> can<00:01:31.030> see

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
do a close-up of that so you can see

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.819 
do a close-up of that so you can see
that<00:01:31.270> now<00:01:31.479> it's<00:01:31.600> got<00:01:31.719> no<00:01:31.899> sulfates<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.530> so

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
that now it's got no sulfates in so

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.550 
that now it's got no sulfates in so
there's<00:01:33.490> salt<00:01:33.759> so<00:01:34.200> hopefully<00:01:35.200> we'll<00:01:35.320> make<00:01:35.409> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
there's salt so hopefully we'll make the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.719 
there's salt so hopefully we'll make the
color<00:01:35.740> last<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.939> bit<00:01:37.119> longer<00:01:37.329> right<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:40.030> um<00:01:40.509> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
color last that bit longer right so um I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.880 
color last that bit longer right so um I
will<00:01:42.729> put<00:01:43.149> another<00:01:43.479> video<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.259> I'll<00:01:44.619> continue

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
will put another video on I'll continue

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.649 
will put another video on I'll continue

once and keep going after about three or
four<00:01:49.450> shampoos<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.979> we<00:01:51.130> can<00:01:51.310> see<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.640> progress

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.999 
four shampoos so we can see the progress
to<00:01:52.180> see<00:01:52.360> how<00:01:52.509> long<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.780> lasts<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.259> I'm<00:01:53.740> really

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
to see how long it lasts so I'm really

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.980 
to see how long it lasts so I'm really
pleased<00:01:54.189> with<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> color<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.420> did<00:01:55.719> expect

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
pleased with the color and I did expect

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.569 
pleased with the color and I did expect
it<00:01:56.140> more<00:01:56.320> lavender<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.799> quite<00:01:57.039> vibrant<00:01:57.250> but

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
it more lavender is quite vibrant but

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.490 
it more lavender is quite vibrant but
considering<00:01:58.119> it's<00:01:58.210> going<00:01:58.359> to<00:01:58.420> fade<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.930> suppose

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
considering it's going to fade I suppose

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.539 
considering it's going to fade I suppose
you're<00:01:59.649> going<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.859> need<00:02:00.009> something<00:02:00.280> with<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
you're going to need something with a

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.639 
you're going to need something with a
bit<00:02:00.759> of<00:02:00.789> impact<00:02:01.119> start<00:02:01.630> off<00:02:01.780> with<00:02:02.079> and<00:02:02.500> then

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
bit of impact start off with and then

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.599 
bit of impact start off with and then
you<00:02:02.770> probably<00:02:02.890> get<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.219> color<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.490> want

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
you probably get the color you want

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.789 
you probably get the color you want
after<00:02:03.909> one<00:02:04.060> or<00:02:04.090> two<00:02:04.210> shampoos<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.079> we'll<00:02:05.619> see

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
after one or two shampoos so we'll see

pink<00:05:07.490> when<00:05:07.639> I<00:05:07.700> started<00:05:08.180> so<00:05:08.479> I'm<00:05:08.870> really

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
pink when I started so I'm really

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.140 
pink when I started so I'm really

over<00:05:11.900> here<00:05:12.050> somewhere<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:13.060> my<00:05:14.060> on<00:05:14.240> my<00:05:14.270> phone

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
over here somewhere of my on my phone

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.300 
over here somewhere of my on my phone
just<00:05:14.900> thinking<00:05:15.380> slight<00:05:15.620> difference<00:05:15.979> in<00:05:16.070> color

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
just thinking slight difference in color

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.610 
just thinking slight difference in color
because<00:05:16.460> tonally<00:05:17.210> it's<00:05:17.930> not<00:05:18.080> quite<00:05:18.289> as<00:05:18.410> blue

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
because tonally it's not quite as blue

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.450 
because tonally it's not quite as blue
as<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.889> shows<00:05:20.260> so<00:05:21.260> hope<00:05:21.410> this<00:05:21.440> was<00:05:21.830> useful<00:05:21.860> to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
as it shows so hope this was useful to

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.610 
as it shows so hope this was useful to
you<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:23.479> look<00:05:24.020> forward<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.260> seeing<00:05:24.470> you
