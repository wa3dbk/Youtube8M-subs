00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
LG g3 so without any further ado let's

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:22.670 
LG g3 so without any further ado let's
get<00:00:11.519> started<00:00:20.660> well<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.140> all<00:00:22.289> how<00:00:22.619> to

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
get started well first of all how to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.640 
get started well first of all how to
actually<00:00:23.250> apply<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.939> case<00:00:24.330> well<00:00:24.990> unlike<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
actually apply this case well unlike the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.529 
actually apply this case well unlike the
previous<00:00:25.949> case<00:00:26.220> which<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.670> supplied<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
previous case which is supplied for the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.040 
previous case which is supplied for the
g2<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.880> replaces<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.240> back<00:00:30.449> cover<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
g2 this replaces the back cover of the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.030 
g2 this replaces the back cover of the
phone<00:00:31.199> itself<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.660> let<00:00:33.660> me<00:00:33.809> quickly<00:00:34.050> slap<00:00:34.800> on

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
phone itself so let me quickly slap on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.119 
phone itself so let me quickly slap on
this<00:00:35.280> flip<00:00:36.120> case<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.020> will<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.440> back<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this flip case and I will be back in a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:38.630 
this flip case and I will be back in a
moment

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
moment

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760 
moment
now<00:00:39.059> before<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> apply<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> quicksort<00:00:40.500> ball

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
now before I apply the quicksort ball

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
now before I apply the quicksort ball
cakes<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.370> wanted<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> point<00:00:41.940> out<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
cakes I just wanted to point out that

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
cakes I just wanted to point out that
replacing<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> back<00:00:44.070> covers<00:00:44.489> does<00:00:44.760> not

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
replacing the back covers does not

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
replacing the back covers does not
really<00:00:45.180> affect<00:00:45.390> any<00:00:45.809> functionality<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
really affect any functionality when it

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.000 
really affect any functionality when it
comes<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> wireless<00:00:47.520> charging<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.149> NFC<00:00:49.010> so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
comes to wireless charging or NFC so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.060 
comes to wireless charging or NFC so
let's<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.860 

now<00:00:54.699> one<00:00:54.910> thing<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.239> noticed<00:00:55.660> after

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
now one thing that I noticed after

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.990 
now one thing that I noticed after
applying<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.559> quick<00:00:56.710> circle<00:00:57.129> case<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.640> that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
applying the quick circle case is that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.349 
applying the quick circle case is that
it<00:00:58.359> actually<00:00:58.660> looks<00:00:59.199> like<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.739> case<00:01:00.070> it<00:01:00.969> offers

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
it actually looks like a case it offers

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.599 
it actually looks like a case it offers
protection<00:01:01.539> on<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.289> sides<00:01:02.559> it<00:01:03.280> offers

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
protection on the sides it offers

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.580 
protection on the sides it offers
protection<00:01:03.820> on<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.269> corners<00:01:04.689> and<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.439> also

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
protection on the corners and it also

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.440 
protection on the corners and it also
offers<00:01:06.040> protection<00:01:06.250> in<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.729> corners<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.299> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
offers protection in the corners of the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.840 
offers protection in the corners of the
bottom<00:01:07.840> also<00:01:08.500> I've<00:01:08.950> observed<00:01:09.340> that<00:01:09.610> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
bottom also I've observed that the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.700 
bottom also I've observed that the
texture<00:01:10.330> on<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.630> back<00:01:10.750> is<00:01:11.049> completely

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
it has a grooved texture to it on the

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.039 
it has a grooved texture to it on the
back<00:01:14.979> compared<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:16.330> brushed<00:01:16.780> metal

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
back compared to the brushed metal

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
it and there we go now this game is

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.710 
it and there we go now this game is
really<00:05:03.639> simple<00:05:03.909> all<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.150> need<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.389> do<00:05:04.479> is

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
really simple all you need to do is

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.649 
really simple all you need to do is
match<00:05:05.050> three<00:05:05.590> puppies<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.220> you'll<00:05:06.789> get<00:05:07.060> more

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
match three puppies and you'll get more

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:08.730 
match three puppies and you'll get more

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
points and as you do

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.159 
points and as you do
so<00:05:11.250> apps<00:05:12.250> like<00:05:12.639> music<00:05:13.030> controls<00:05:13.449> and<00:05:13.690> camera

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
so apps like music controls and camera

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.100 
so apps like music controls and camera
do<00:05:14.560> really<00:05:14.830> make<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.160> lot<00:05:15.370> of<00:05:15.400> sense<00:05:15.669> but<00:05:16.110> games

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
do really make a lot of sense but games

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.980 
do really make a lot of sense but games
not<00:05:17.979> really<00:05:18.430> because<00:05:19.090> there's<00:05:19.389> only<00:05:19.539> so<00:05:19.840> much

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
not really because there's only so much

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.439 
not really because there's only so much
you<00:05:20.050> can<00:05:20.199> do<00:05:20.500> in<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.770> small<00:05:20.889> space<00:05:21.340> now<00:05:21.639> there<00:05:22.330> is

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
you can do in a small space now there is

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.029 
you can do in a small space now there is
one<00:05:22.690> other<00:05:22.720> thing<00:05:22.900> about<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:23.470> quick<00:05:23.680> circle

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
one other thing about this quick circle

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.120 
one other thing about this quick circle
it<00:05:24.910> does<00:05:25.180> not<00:05:25.330> really<00:05:25.660> have<00:05:26.139> anything<00:05:26.740> in<00:05:26.979> it

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
it does not really have anything in it

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.279 
it does not really have anything in it
to<00:05:27.280> protect<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.729> screen<00:05:28.060> they<00:05:28.630> will<00:05:28.660> be<00:05:29.020> dust

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
to protect the screen they will be dust

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.159 
to protect the screen they will be dust
accumulation<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:30.220> many<00:05:31.000> fingerprints<00:05:31.509> but

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
accumulation and many fingerprints but

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.480 
accumulation and many fingerprints but
this<00:05:32.380> also<00:05:32.530> means<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.250> touch

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
this also means that the touch

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.300 
this also means that the touch
responsiveness<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.449> really<00:05:34.930> good<00:05:35.110> also<00:05:35.770> one

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
responsiveness is really good also one

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.100 
responsiveness is really good also one
other<00:05:36.340> advantage<00:05:36.759> of<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.360> quick<00:05:37.539> circle<00:05:37.900> not

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
other advantage of the quick circle not

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.860 
other advantage of the quick circle not
having<00:05:38.500> anything<00:05:38.949> in<00:05:39.160> it<00:05:39.310> is<00:05:39.490> that<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.630> back

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
having anything in it is that the back

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.050 
having anything in it is that the back
camera<00:05:41.110> does<00:05:41.500> not<00:05:41.530> get<00:05:41.889> any<00:05:42.159> Distortion

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
camera does not get any Distortion

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.540 
camera does not get any Distortion
the<00:05:43.690> big<00:05:43.840> circle<00:05:44.139> does<00:05:44.289> not<00:05:44.440> cover<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:45.250> laser

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550

also I forgot to mention eyes this is a
smart<00:06:17.110> cover<00:06:17.320> which<00:06:17.650> means<00:06:17.919> when<00:06:18.250> you<00:06:18.340> open

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
smart cover which means when you open

smart cover which means when you open
the<00:06:18.789> case<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.300> will<00:06:19.810> automatically<00:06:20.500> turn<00:06:20.770> on

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
the case it will automatically turn on

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.830 
the case it will automatically turn on
the<00:06:21.039> display<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.729> when<00:06:21.909> you<00:06:22.030> close<00:06:22.300> it<00:06:22.360> it'll

thing<00:06:25.270> about<00:06:25.330> this<00:06:25.599> flip<00:06:25.840> tower<00:06:26.050> is<00:06:26.320> that<00:06:26.530> it

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
thing about this flip tower is that it

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.110 
thing about this flip tower is that it
does<00:06:26.800> not<00:06:26.919> really<00:06:27.159> save<00:06:27.370> a<00:06:27.400> lot<00:06:27.610> of<00:06:27.729> battery

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
does not really save a lot of battery

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.510 
does not really save a lot of battery
because<00:06:28.570> the<00:06:28.599> entire<00:06:29.139> display<00:06:29.500> is<00:06:29.919> completely

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
because the entire display is completely

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.820 
because the entire display is completely
turned<00:06:30.729> on<00:06:31.060> whenever<00:06:31.750> you<00:06:31.960> turn<00:06:32.259> on<00:06:32.440> the

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
turned on whenever you turn on the

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.550 
turned on whenever you turn on the
display<00:06:33.130> in<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.729> quick<00:06:34.360> circle<00:06:34.780> so<00:06:35.320> as<00:06:35.440> you

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
display in the quick circle so as you

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.680 
display in the quick circle so as you
can<00:06:35.680> see<00:06:35.830> right<00:06:36.039> here<00:06:36.400> the<00:06:36.729> entire<00:06:37.090> display<00:06:37.479> is

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
can see right here the entire display is

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.930 
can see right here the entire display is
completely<00:06:38.259> turned<00:06:38.409> on<00:06:38.680> whenever<00:06:39.460> you<00:06:39.699> access

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
completely turned on whenever you access

completely turned on whenever you access
the<00:06:40.300> quick<00:06:40.569> circle<00:06:40.960> so<00:06:41.530> this<00:06:41.800> does<00:06:42.009> not<00:06:42.159> really

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
the quick circle so this does not really

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.879 
the quick circle so this does not really
see<00:06:42.669> it<00:06:42.789> a<00:06:42.909> lot<00:06:43.180> of<00:06:43.210> battery<00:06:43.780> I<00:06:43.990> guess<00:06:44.530> that<00:06:44.740> is

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
see it a lot of battery I guess that is
