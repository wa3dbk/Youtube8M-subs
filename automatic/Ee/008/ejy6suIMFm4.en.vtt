00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
could get my hands on it so I could

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
could get my hands on it so I could

aforementioned<00:02:02.340> technology<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.270> just

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
aforementioned technology what I just

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.330 
aforementioned technology what I just
said<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.840> nice<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.409> perhaps<00:02:04.619> maybe<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.130> bit

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
said is nice but perhaps maybe a bit

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.889 
said is nice but perhaps maybe a bit
more<00:02:05.549> than<00:02:05.729> what<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.880> normally<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.450> well<00:02:06.750> then

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
more than what you normally do well then

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.719 
more than what you normally do well then
that's<00:02:07.079> where<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.290> h<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.439> 600<00:02:08.069> model<00:02:08.340> comes<00:02:08.550> in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.340 
that's where the h of 600 model comes in
it<00:02:08.910> might<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> your<00:02:09.539> liking
