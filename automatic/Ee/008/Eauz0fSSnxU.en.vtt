00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.450
 there and here some targets and it is with great 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.610
 satisfaction Eugenio edit more this 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.610
 video to post here on the channel 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.120
 now with this path 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.660
 in version 1 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.380
 the dps2000 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.780
 trying to convert 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.680
 It's fashion from Telma map 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.100
 to this new version 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.460
 - I had been buried for 1,118 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.460
 points 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.840
 it was not easy to convert 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.580
 I opened the map, so now you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.580
 fighting made the conversion 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.620
 And this is still a bit heavy here. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.289
 I'm going to tie the knot 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.960
 we were not the pain it is very strong the score to 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:09.220
 plate is more Portuguese than I 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.220
 a memory is 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.210
 the roundabout then how can you 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.450
 and I'm running here in a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.909
 in telmex so but here in the new 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.259
 version of the game 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.259
 so it's ok 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.360
 because of almeida 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.530
 would make Portuguese 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 this mole 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 back in version 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.330
 the attempt gave stumps 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.320
 make this conversion 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.320
 the defects there 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.540
 withdrawal now becomes a defect 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.940
 to be able to edit again 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.220
 So, but only now, just a little bit. 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.790
 the settings there so I can fix it 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.390
 to share on the mov channel 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.390
 so brief 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.180
 our week 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.660
 I would take this new version of the game 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.660
 and even the comments his friend has 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.569
 regretting that you can not because you can not 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.569
 use the new version of the world 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.030
 for each part of the public notice 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.830
 a wrong proportion in this 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 I left over that track 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.810
 so we're still here, I'm just going 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.810
 show this environment that small piece 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.660
 but I can see a video soon 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.000
 showing 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.000
 it's step by step there from editing 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.690
 the other 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.770
 It is to the front until near the roundabout 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.770
 however avenue manoel ribas 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.190
 That's what I would like to comment on. 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.780
 with friends 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 and by the way it will work out 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.200
 I make the video 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.190
 here on the channel see you soon 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.190
 on the road
