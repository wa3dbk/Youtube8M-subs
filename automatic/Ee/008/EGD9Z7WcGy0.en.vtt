00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
switching to my falcon punch and i'm

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.710 
switching to my falcon punch and i'm
just<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> sub<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.570> i<00:00:48.660> know

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
just gonna go for the sub because i know

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.770 
just gonna go for the sub because i know
i<00:00:48.810> can<00:00:49.460> sub<00:00:50.460> stall<00:00:50.880> this<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.660> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
i can sub stall this thing because of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
i can sub stall this thing because of
the<00:00:51.870> toxic<00:00:52.320> damage<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.220> I'll<00:00:53.340> either<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the toxic damage so I'll either have to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.110 
the toxic damage so I'll either have to
switch<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.690> he'll<00:00:54.810> eventually<00:00:55.020> die<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
switch out or he'll eventually die and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.280 
switch out or he'll eventually die and
that's<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> work<00:00:57.540> out<00:00:57.750> pretty<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.110> for

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
that's going to work out pretty well for

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.590 
that's going to work out pretty well for
me<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.800> I'm<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.970> keep<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.239> for

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
me here I'm just going to keep going for

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.690 
me here I'm just going to keep going for
the<00:01:00.720> subs<00:01:00.989> while<00:01:01.350> he<00:01:01.560> uses<00:01:01.860> his<00:01:02.100> attack<00:01:02.489> of

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
the subs while he uses his attack of

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.340 
the subs while he uses his attack of
choice<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.720> dark<00:01:03.989> pulse

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.140 

pretty<00:01:07.350> standard<00:01:07.620> so<00:01:07.980> far<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.030> he's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
pretty standard so far but then he's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.970 
pretty standard so far but then he's
going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.660> pain<00:01:09.930> split<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.500> really

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
going to go for a pain split I really

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.500 
going to go for a pain split I really
have<00:01:11.130> no<00:01:11.250> idea<00:01:11.280> why<00:01:11.730> because<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.150> doesn't<00:01:12.390> work

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
have no idea why because it doesn't work

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.380 
have no idea why because it doesn't work
on<00:01:12.690> subs<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.910> was<00:01:15.000> pretty<00:01:15.180> obvious

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
on subs and that it was pretty obvious

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.360 
on subs and that it was pretty obvious
I'd<00:01:15.720> go<00:01:15.870> for<00:01:16.050> sub<00:01:16.260> there<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.770> even<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.250> i

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
I'd go for sub there and even if i

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.970 
I'd go for sub there and even if i
didn't<00:01:17.730> i<00:01:17.880> didn't<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.780> HP<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.680> i

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
didn't i didn't have that much HP so i

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.000 
didn't i didn't have that much HP so i
don't<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.730> but<00:01:21.500> it's<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> leave<00:01:22.860> me

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
don't know but it's going to leave me

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.680 
don't know but it's going to leave me
with<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.160> sub<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.880> he<00:01:23.940> dies<00:01:24.150> i'm<00:01:24.540> just

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
with a sub up when he dies i'm just

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.180 
with a sub up when he dies i'm just
gonna<00:01:24.780> give<00:01:24.990> me<00:01:25.110> freely<00:01:25.440> proceed<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.010> this

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
gonna give me freely proceed on this

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.860 
gonna give me freely proceed on this
luxray<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.240> guess<00:01:27.270> didn't<00:01:27.660> really

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
luxray which I guess didn't really

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.600 
luxray which I guess didn't really
matter<00:01:28.050> too<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:30.180> um<00:01:31.070> yeah<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> decide<00:01:32.580> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
matter too much but um yeah I decide to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
matter too much but um yeah I decide to
switch<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.170> thousand

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
switch out here and going to my thousand

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.350 
switch out here and going to my thousand

to<00:01:46.740> over<00:01:46.920> predict<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.370> anything<00:01:47.670> too<00:01:47.880> early

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to over predict or anything too early

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.860 
to over predict or anything too early
and<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> does<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.410> most<00:01:49.590> damage<00:01:50.870> it

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
and it does you know the most damage it

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.270 
and it does you know the most damage it
actually<00:01:52.020> does<00:01:52.260> like<00:01:52.440> slightly<00:01:52.740> less<00:01:53.010> than<00:01:53.190> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
actually does like slightly less than I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
actually does like slightly less than I
thought<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.240> luxury<00:01:55.020> has<00:01:55.200> actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
thought but on luxury has actually

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
thought but on luxury has actually
really<00:01:55.710> nice<00:01:55.890> base<00:01:56.160> stats<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.790> an<00:01:56.910> nu<00:01:57.210> Pope

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
really nice base stats for an nu Pope

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.930 
really nice base stats for an nu Pope
it's<00:01:58.290> pretty<00:01:58.590> well-rounded<00:01:59.130> other<00:01:59.760> than

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
it's pretty well-rounded other than

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.380 
it's pretty well-rounded other than
speed<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.770> um<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.790> switch<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.120> here

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
speed so um I'm gonna switch out here

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the toxic here before the heal bell just

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.420 
the toxic here before the heal bell just
because<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.170> needed<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.739> toxic<00:02:32.310> as

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
because I needed to get that toxic as

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.010 
because I needed to get that toxic as
soon<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:32.730> possible<00:02:33.239> because<00:02:33.270> for<00:02:33.600> alligators

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
soon as possible because for alligators

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.440 
soon as possible because for alligators
can<00:02:34.230> sweep<00:02:34.590> pretty<00:02:34.860> easily<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:36.030> yeah<00:02:36.209> he<00:02:36.360> went

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
can sweep pretty easily and yeah he went

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.050 
can sweep pretty easily and yeah he went
for<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.720> swagger<00:02:37.260> which<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.620> really

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
for a swagger which is really

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.370 
for a swagger which is really
interesting<00:02:39.060> move<00:02:39.270> for<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> sword<00:02:40.020> inch<00:02:40.200> for

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
interesting move for a sword inch for

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.570 
interesting move for a sword inch for
alligator<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> guess<00:02:41.190> that's<00:02:41.400> what<00:02:41.550> makes

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
alligator but I guess that's what makes

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.699 
alligator but I guess that's what makes
original<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.420> he's<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.410> going<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
original and he's not really going to

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.140 
original and he's not really going to
get<00:02:43.890> these<00:02:44.100> confusion

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
get these confusion

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.360 
get these confusion

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.490 
quick but yeah he's going to keep going
for<00:02:53.549> aqua<00:02:53.879> jet<00:02:54.090> which<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.569> actually<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.349> really

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
for aqua jet which is actually a really

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.410 
for aqua jet which is actually a really
good<00:02:55.739> move<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.370> feraligatr<00:02:56.939> a<00:02:57.030> lot<00:02:57.329> of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
good move for a feraligatr a lot of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.470 
good move for a feraligatr a lot of
people<00:02:57.659> don't<00:02:57.930> play<00:02:58.640> aquajet<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.329> i

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
people don't play aquajet on there and i

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.330 
people don't play aquajet on there and i
really<00:03:00.689> think<00:03:00.840> they<00:03:01.049> should<00:03:01.349> although<00:03:02.310> he

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
really think they should although he

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.949 
really think they should although he
probably<00:03:02.700> should<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.030> another<00:03:03.239> attack<00:03:03.599> move

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
probably should have another attack move

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.589 
probably should have another attack move
instead<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:04.470> swagger<00:03:04.950> vestas<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.489> opinion<00:03:05.909> so

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
instead of swagger vestas my opinion so

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.089 
instead of swagger vestas my opinion so
I'm<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.930> double<00:03:07.290> switch<00:03:07.530> first<00:03:07.829> in<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
I'm going to double switch first in the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.130 
I'm going to double switch first in the
hypno<00:03:08.459> predicting<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.150> sleep<00:03:09.659> powder<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
hypno predicting the sleep powder and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.530 
hypno predicting the sleep powder and
then<00:03:10.230> into<00:03:10.439> arcanine<00:03:11.329> breaking<00:03:12.329> anything

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
then into arcanine breaking anything

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.149 
then into arcanine breaking anything
other<00:03:12.870> than<00:03:13.019> sleep<00:03:13.260> powder<00:03:13.549> just<00:03:14.549> so<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.730> could

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
other than sleep powder just so I could

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.890 
other than sleep powder just so I could
hit<00:03:17.159> that<00:03:17.220> butter<00:03:17.579> free<00:03:17.909> I<00:03:18.120> didn't<00:03:18.780> really

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
hit that butter free I didn't really

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.300 
hit that butter free I didn't really
think<00:03:19.019> he'd<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> good<00:03:19.739> counter<00:03:20.069> for<00:03:20.220> my

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
think he'd have a good counter for my

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.309 
think he'd have a good counter for my
arc<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.639> I'm<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.269> his<00:03:21.510> team<00:03:21.690> at<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.019> point

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
arc and I'm on his team at this point

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.960 
arc and I'm on his team at this point
since<00:03:22.530> he<00:03:22.680> didn't<00:03:22.859> switch<00:03:23.069> him<00:03:23.250> into<00:03:23.879> it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
since he didn't switch him into it

since he didn't switch him into it
before<00:03:24.230> but<00:03:25.230> he<00:03:25.319> does<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.680> cloister<00:03:26.099> which

of<00:03:28.680> toxic<00:03:29.159> spikes<00:03:29.459> which<00:03:31.220> kind<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.340> actually

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
of toxic spikes which kind of actually

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.240 
of toxic spikes which kind of actually
helps<00:03:32.879> me<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:33.989> he's<00:03:34.139> not<00:03:34.769> going<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.099> lay

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
helps me because he's not going to lay

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.759 
helps me because he's not going to lay
the<00:03:35.430> second<00:03:35.760> layer<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> advice<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.560> anyone

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
the second layer so I advice to anyone

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.280 
the second layer so I advice to anyone
watching<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.310> video<00:03:38.670> always<00:03:39.239> put<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> second

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
watching this video always put a second

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.929 
watching this video always put a second
layer<00:03:40.379> of<00:03:40.500> toxic<00:03:40.889> spikes<00:03:41.159> up<00:03:41.430> because<00:03:41.700> it'll

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
layer of toxic spikes up because it'll

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.750 
layer of toxic spikes up because it'll
make<00:03:41.970> them<00:03:42.209> badly<00:03:42.510> poisoned<00:03:42.950> which<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.159> one

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
make them badly poisoned which is one

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.020 
make them badly poisoned which is one
sixteenth<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.540> 216<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.379> 316<00:03:47.069> of<00:03:47.489> their

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
sixteenth and 216 and 316 of their

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.150 
sixteenth and 216 and 316 of their
health<00:03:48.239> as<00:03:48.450> opposed<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.410> regular<00:03:49.560> poison

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
health as opposed to regular poison

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.720 
health as opposed to regular poison
which<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.430> 116<00:03:51.560> every<00:03:52.560> turn<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.609> he's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
which is just 116 every turn so he's

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.220 
which is just 116 every turn so he's
going<00:03:53.819> to<00:03:53.910> keep<00:03:54.060> going<00:03:54.209> for<00:03:54.480> rock<00:03:54.660> blast<00:03:54.989> there

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
going to keep going for rock blast there

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.170 
going to keep going for rock blast there
and<00:03:55.530> he's<00:03:55.739> going<00:03:55.949> to<00:03:56.010> get<00:03:56.190> some<00:03:56.370> misses<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:57.090> it

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and he's going to get some misses but it

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.420 
and he's going to get some misses but it
doesn't<00:03:57.419> really<00:03:57.480> matter<00:03:57.750> because<00:03:58.109> I<00:03:58.799> could

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
doesn't really matter because I could

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.460 
doesn't really matter because I could
easily<00:03:59.669> just<00:04:00.000> milk<00:04:00.329> drink<00:04:00.629> off<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.049> damage

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
easily just milk drink off the damage

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.830 
easily just milk drink off the damage
because<00:04:01.889> even<00:04:02.340> with<00:04:02.489> one<00:04:02.819> or<00:04:03.000> two<00:04:03.030> crits<00:04:03.449> it's

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
because even with one or two crits it's

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.229 
because even with one or two crits it's
not<00:04:04.019> even<00:04:04.230> going<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.379> do<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.909> so<00:04:05.909> I<00:04:05.940> don't

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
not even going to do that so I don't

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.460 
not even going to do that so I don't
know<00:04:06.299> why<00:04:06.419> he<00:04:06.659> was<00:04:06.810> going<00:04:07.019> for<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.319> rock

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
know why he was going for the rock

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.729 
know why he was going for the rock
blasts<00:04:08.129> because<00:04:08.870> ya<00:04:09.870> wouldn't<00:04:10.440> have<00:04:10.560> done

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
blasts because ya wouldn't have done

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.129 
blasts because ya wouldn't have done
anything<00:04:11.040> really<00:04:11.340> i<00:04:11.459> could<00:04:11.699> easily<00:04:11.849> um<00:04:12.239> toxic

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
anything really i could easily um toxic

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.339 
anything really i could easily um toxic
stalling<00:04:13.500> with<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> milk<00:04:13.889> drink<00:04:14.389> so<00:04:15.389> i<00:04:15.870> guess

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
stalling with the milk drink so i guess

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.750 
stalling with the milk drink so i guess
you<00:04:16.470> didn't<00:04:16.769> want<00:04:16.919> his<00:04:17.010> closer<00:04:17.370> anymore<00:04:17.729> i

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
you didn't want his closer anymore i

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.330 
you didn't want his closer anymore i
really

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
really

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.250 
really
no<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.730> was<00:04:19.359> surprised<00:04:19.630> he<00:04:19.780> didn't<00:04:19.959> actually<00:04:20.079> go

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
no I was surprised he didn't actually go

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.900 
no I was surprised he didn't actually go
for<00:04:20.410> explosion<00:04:21.010> i<00:04:21.100> was<00:04:21.220> thinking<00:04:21.519> go<00:04:21.699> for

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
for explosion i was thinking go for

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.750 
for explosion i was thinking go for
explosion<00:04:22.419> but<00:04:22.870> my<00:04:23.620> miltank<00:04:23.980> did<00:04:24.190> its<00:04:24.340> job<00:04:24.430> at

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
explosion but my miltank did its job at

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.220 
explosion but my miltank did its job at
that<00:04:24.880> point<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:25.240> i<00:04:25.389> was<00:04:25.630> ready<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:26.020> sacrifice

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
that point so i was ready to sacrifice

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.770 
that point so i was ready to sacrifice
it<00:04:26.740> if<00:04:26.830> need<00:04:27.010> be<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:28.240> yeah<00:04:28.360> i'm<00:04:28.510> going<00:04:28.690> to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
it if need be so yeah i'm going to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.379 
it if need be so yeah i'm going to
predict<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.169> sleep<00:04:29.860> powder<00:04:30.070> or<00:04:30.370> stun<00:04:31.030> spore

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
predict the sleep powder or stun spore

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.120 
predict the sleep powder or stun spore
and<00:04:31.540> go<00:04:31.660> into<00:04:31.780> arcanine<00:04:32.199> because<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.650> toxic

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
and go into arcanine because the toxic

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.939 
and go into arcanine because the toxic
will<00:04:33.370> make<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.180> he<00:04:34.300> can't<00:04:34.479> status<00:04:34.930> me<00:04:35.139> i<00:04:35.380> go

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
will make it so he can't status me i go

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.320 
will make it so he can't status me i go
for<00:04:36.100> extreme<00:04:36.490> speed<00:04:36.760> because<00:04:37.030> i<00:04:37.120> thought

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
for extreme speed because i thought

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.810 
for extreme speed because i thought
exchange<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:37.960> too<00:04:38.260> would<00:04:38.710> be<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.919> 28<00:04:39.250> KO<00:04:39.460> but

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
exchange to you too would be a 28 KO but

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.700 
exchange to you too would be a 28 KO but
it's<00:04:39.940> not<00:04:40.150> he's<00:04:40.780> gonna<00:04:40.930> go<00:04:41.050> for<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.320> attract

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
it's not he's gonna go for the attract

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.010 
it's not he's gonna go for the attract
and<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.970> really<00:04:43.180> have<00:04:43.270> nothing<00:04:43.360> better<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.870> do

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
and I really have nothing better to do

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.330 
and I really have nothing better to do
so<00:04:44.260> I'm<00:04:44.320> just<00:04:44.470> going<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.710> go<00:04:44.770> ahead<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.040> risk

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
so I'm just going to go ahead and risk

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.060 
so I'm just going to go ahead and risk
it<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.580> go<00:04:45.850> for<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.410> flare<00:04:47.410> blitz<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:47.979> is

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
it and go for the flare blitz and it is

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.189 
it and go for the flare blitz and it is
going<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.310> work<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.720> think<00:04:49.930> that's<00:04:50.080> the

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
going to work and I think that's the

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.990 
going to work and I think that's the
main<00:04:50.410> reason<00:04:50.440> that<00:04:50.800> people<00:04:51.160> don't<00:04:51.490> use<00:04:51.970> a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
main reason that people don't use a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.090 
main reason that people don't use a
tract<00:04:52.389> it's<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:52.870> because<00:04:53.139> if<00:04:53.290> your<00:04:53.620> Pokemon

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
tract it's just because if your Pokemon

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.379 
tract it's just because if your Pokemon
dies<00:04:54.340> or<00:04:54.669> if<00:04:54.760> you<00:04:54.790> switch<00:04:55.210> they're<00:04:55.870> no<00:04:56.110> longer

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
dies or if you switch they're no longer

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.850 
dies or if you switch they're no longer
confused<00:04:58.389> basically<00:04:59.110> or<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.800> know

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
confused basically or you know

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.670 
confused basically or you know
infatuated<00:05:00.300> whereas<00:05:01.300> confused<00:05:01.900> ray<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.500> can

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
infatuated whereas confused ray you can

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.020 
infatuated whereas confused ray you can
like<00:05:02.830> switch<00:05:03.130> around<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.520> stuff<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:03.910> they'll

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
like switch around and stuff and they'll

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.090 
like switch around and stuff and they'll
still<00:05:04.180> be<00:05:04.210> confused<00:05:04.750> so<00:05:05.650> he<00:05:05.770> went<00:05:05.830> for<00:05:06.010> an

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
still be confused so he went for an

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.080 
still be confused so he went for an
