00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.170
 Collector's editions are humid 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.990
 dream of every game -fans here 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.939
 the motto is the bigger the better 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.829
 For example, we would have the black 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.050
 edition of assassin's creed 2 makes them 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:27.079
 already quite good in the shelf a little bit bigger 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.219
 ok world of warcraft cataclysm for 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.770
 example was also a very 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.599
 impressive collector's edition more 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.770
 Lots of room in the game shelf has become 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.899
 also the collector's edition of the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.510
 public is not much bigger 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.890
 far from arenanet and nc soft 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.270
 publish the collector's edition 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.370
 by guild wars 2 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.540
 and that's about the biggest 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.880
 I ever box in my life 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.480
 Everybody has seen and there is 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.910
 amount in it 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.110
 Let's take a look at the obvious 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.320
 Highlight you can already see through this 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:03.140
 slice namely a 25 centimeters large 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.420
 figure made of beautifully processed plastic 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.450
 and with a flames got out too 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.649
 I plastic that now just in it 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.659
 In any case, it is already one 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.310
 really nice part because you need 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.680
 Do not be ashamed if this is on the shelf 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.890
 but of course that's not all 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.440
 there are in this box but there is 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.500
 even more so if you have the whole 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.549
 inner rausholt and now it will be 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.409
 slow difficult here on the 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.390
 desk any amount 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.670
 packaging materials and now comes 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.220
 the second pregnant of the collector's 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.420
 For God's sake, I will 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.610
 just have too small office this very much 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.229
 large beautifully processed tin can 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.260
 which also has a nice relief 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.590
 is pressed and also here is each 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.490
 amount in it 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.049
 The beginning is a very big pub 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.140
 Envelope there we look the same 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:06.590
 in there we have five art prints 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.769
 with guild wars 2 artworks also here 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.480
 Protected by additional leaves 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.040
 which I think is very nice with it 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.180
 will not scratch or even a 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 get kinked because that's what you want 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.130
 really do not have 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.989
 and that would not be enough 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.400
 one in the collector's edition too 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.159
 still 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.299
 a fitting frame to where you once were 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.819
 This artwork is one of the best 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.170
 Like to pack in here and to the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.250
 can hang wall and that they can then 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.950
 really cool as I think 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.709
 also in this box is 112 sided 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.730
 artbook art bound and correct 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.439
 firmly processed 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.120
 and the clou while I find it 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.609
 Artbooks always important that beside 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.409
 artworks and concept drawings 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.459
 also background information 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.060
 be included so I too 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.440
 a little something about that 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.150
 genesis of guild wars 2 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.950
 experienced and here is a lot 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.629
 it is a lot of text and above all 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.109
 That also happens a lot too 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.379
 Rare 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.579
 It's all translated into German 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.650
 typical of a collector's edition of it 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.599
 There are also some ingame objects 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.790
 five of the numbers are here among others 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.560
 accompanied a small petz of the 1 if 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.389
 you call it or you and that is 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.950
 especially exciting an elite craft 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.430
 which you can only use if you 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.260
 owner of the collector's edition is it 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.209
 continues 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.549
 namely with the best of guild wars 2 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.840
 soundtrack of the great 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.760
 composers jeremy soule who is already the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.019
 predecessor has composed and also for 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.669
 the elder scrolls row in charge 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.530
 So last was really big with 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.970
 skyrim was busy and allowed himself 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.609
 then very quickly to guild wars 2 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.669
 sentences the result is here on it 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.699
 six tracks last but not least 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.799
 most important of course the game that you 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.359
 here in such a cardboard box also something 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.699
 processed differently than one then from 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.379
 a normal sale version knows there 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.970
 we have the games here and on 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.280
 the left side just a few more 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.489
 references and also the unlock code 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.530
 for the account a real manual 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.030
 is missing in here but that is one 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.049
 little bit just a pity about one 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.940
 I would have collector's edition then 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.120
 but also a small manual 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.109
 wished where so the beginner 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.799
 tips are in it 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.299
 but all in all, one is one 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.220
 very nicely finished and above all 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.959
 Very well filled collector's stuff 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.870
 edition now comes the big one though 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.130
 namely the price even if the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.159
 box is so huge and even if 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.760
 a lot is in it you have 150 euros for it 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:29.919
 It is really hard to shell out 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.900
 hardcore guild wars be fan though 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.900
 If that is then I think leads 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.110
 no way at this 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.790
 box over for what she said is 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.440
 huge and there is a lot in there it is 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.910
 wonderfully processed so we wish 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.259
 that always especially the artbook 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.000
 convinced by the German itself 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.220
 of course through the german texts of the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.900
 soundtrack is great and the figure 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.600
 makes himself as I said gorgeous in the shelf 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.789
 you do not have to guild wars 2 yourself 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.889
 Maybe a lot more will say that 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.680
 Things can be done without monthly fees 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.560
 Say you buy yourself once and can 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.330
 Then play for free until the doctor 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.530
 comes and you should also in guild 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.550
 Wars 2 is a fantastic one 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.550
 become an online roleplayer
