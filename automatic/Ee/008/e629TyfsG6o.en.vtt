in<00:00:58.750> behavior<00:00:58.840> never<00:00:59.410> getting<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.800> result<00:00:59.949> so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
in behavior never getting a result so

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.759 
in behavior never getting a result so
the<00:01:00.789> dog<00:01:00.969> is<00:01:01.149> getting<00:01:01.269> jerk<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:01.929> constantly

in the same fashion but it's got a bit

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.500 
in the same fashion but it's got a bit
of<00:01:11.890> nip<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.400> it's<00:01:12.610> got<00:01:12.730> some<00:01:12.880> bite<00:01:13.120> which<00:01:13.360> is

going<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.690> very<00:01:13.960> quickly<00:01:14.260> teach<00:01:15.010> this<00:01:15.160> dog

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
going to very quickly teach this dog

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.010 
going to very quickly teach this dog
that<00:01:15.520> pulling<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.940> unacceptable<00:01:16.690> no<00:01:16.840> matter

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
that pulling is unacceptable no matter

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.840 
that pulling is unacceptable no matter
how<00:01:17.170> many<00:01:17.290> situations<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.010> go<00:01:18.159> into<00:01:18.340> after<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
how many situations I go into after the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.640 
how many situations I go into after the
first<00:01:19.090> five<00:01:19.299> minutes<00:01:19.540> she's<00:01:20.170> not<00:01:20.290> gonna<00:01:20.409> pull

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
first five minutes she's not gonna pull

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.560 
first five minutes she's not gonna pull
so<00:01:21.100> there's<00:01:21.310> no<00:01:21.400> more<00:01:21.520> danger<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.150> her<00:01:22.270> throat

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
so there's no more danger to her throat

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.030 
so there's no more danger to her throat
so<00:01:23.079> where<00:01:23.200> people<00:01:23.439> get<00:01:23.500> all<00:01:23.650> bent<00:01:23.829> out<00:01:23.979> of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
so where people get all bent out of

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.560 
so where people get all bent out of
shape<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.430> they<00:01:24.520> think<00:01:24.729> oh<00:01:24.880> but<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.270> correct

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
shape and they think oh but it's correct

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.630 
shape and they think oh but it's correct
if<00:01:25.689> it<00:01:25.750> looks<00:01:25.960> nasty<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.409> looks<00:01:26.560> mean<00:01:26.799> if<00:01:27.430> we

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
if it looks nasty it looks mean if we

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.940 
if it looks nasty it looks mean if we
recognize<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.360> fact<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.810> what's<00:01:29.350> meaner<00:01:29.649> a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
recognize the fact that what's meaner a

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.429 
recognize the fact that what's meaner a
couple<00:01:30.460> of<00:01:30.549> corrections<00:01:31.060> with<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.540> collar<00:01:31.869> that

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
couple of corrections with a collar that

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.710 
couple of corrections with a collar that
creates<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.220> change<00:01:33.610> in<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.880> behavior<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.659> you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
creates a change in the behavior so you

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.690 
creates a change in the behavior so you
