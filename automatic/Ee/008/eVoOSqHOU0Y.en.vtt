00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
headlight bricks I believe that's what's
called<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.940> you'll<00:01:00.090> notice<00:01:00.270> there's<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
called if you'll notice there's a lot of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.650 
called if you'll notice there's a lot of
the<00:01:01.620> color<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> black<00:01:02.910> scheme<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.539> if

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the color is a black scheme but if

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.719 
the color is a black scheme but if
there's<00:01:03.809> any<00:01:03.960> pieces<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.619> aren't<00:01:04.920> black

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
there's any pieces that aren't black

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
there's any pieces that aren't black
it's<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.600> didn't<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it's just because I didn't have the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's just because I didn't have the
pieces<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> time<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.640> build<00:01:09.380> okay<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pieces at the time to build okay and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.700 
pieces at the time to build okay and
then<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> need<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.420> um<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.560> by

then you're going to need this um one by

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.880 
then you're going to need this um one by
one<00:01:13.860> black<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.770> don't<00:01:16.770> know
