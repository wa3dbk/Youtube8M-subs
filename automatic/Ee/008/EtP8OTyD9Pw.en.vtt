every you know couple inches or so I

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.640 
every you know couple inches or so I
just<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.830> know<00:01:41.860> poke<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:43.409> inject<00:01:44.409> and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
just you know poke it in and inject and

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.450 
just you know poke it in and inject and
pull<00:01:44.830> out

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.290 

quite<00:01:49.060> simple<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:54.550> sometimes<00:01:54.910> it<00:01:55.030> gets<00:01:55.150> all

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
quite simple and sometimes it gets all

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.410 
quite simple and sometimes it gets all
over<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.510> place<00:01:55.660> but<00:01:55.960> hey<00:01:56.860> we're<00:01:57.400> barbecuing

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.200 

alright

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.120 

this<00:02:05.900> should<00:02:06.170> help<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.680> did<00:02:06.830> this<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.100> last

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
this should help I did this the last

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.370 
this should help I did this the last
time<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.179> think<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.539> made<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> difference<00:02:09.170> by

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
time and I think it made a difference by

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.900 
time and I think it made a difference by
injecting<00:02:11.290> my<00:02:12.290> last<00:02:12.560> smoke<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.490> apparently

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
injecting my last smoke I apparently

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.570 
injecting my last smoke I apparently
didn't<00:02:14.450> cook<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.260> long<00:02:15.380> enough<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.370> thought

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
didn't cook it long enough and I thought

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.120 
didn't cook it long enough and I thought
10<00:02:17.570> hours<00:02:17.870> was<00:02:18.020> enough<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.320> someone<00:02:21.709> commented

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
10 hours was enough so someone commented

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.540 
10 hours was enough so someone commented
on<00:02:22.160> with<00:02:22.370> my<00:02:22.459> videos<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:24.980> should<00:02:25.250> do<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
on with my videos that I should do it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.790 
on with my videos that I should do it
until<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.540> internal<00:02:27.080> temperature<00:02:27.140> reaches

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
until the internal temperature reaches

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.160 
until the internal temperature reaches
about<00:02:27.920> 190<00:02:28.340> then<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.820> guess<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.270> protein<00:02:29.990> does

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
about 190 then I guess the protein does

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.780 
about 190 then I guess the protein does
meet<00:02:30.380> break<00:02:30.620> down<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.190> that's<00:02:31.340> what<00:02:31.490> makes<00:02:31.640> it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
meet break down and that's what makes it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.650 
meet break down and that's what makes it
so<00:02:32.690> tender<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:34.670> don't<00:02:35.120> give<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.450> try<00:02:35.600> this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
so tender so I don't give it a try this

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.830 
so tender so I don't give it a try this
time

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
time

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.520 
time
