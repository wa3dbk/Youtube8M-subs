show that was not ethnic Lee diverse and
the<00:03:27.290> reason<00:03:27.739> for<00:03:27.769> that<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.670> people

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
the reason for that is that the people

bold<00:03:51.980> move<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.519> bound<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.150> raise<00:03:53.329> a<00:03:53.389> few

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.839 
bold move is bound to raise a few
eyebrows<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.590> think<00:03:55.010> one<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.459> things<00:03:55.489> that

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
eyebrows I think one of the things that

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.550 
eyebrows I think one of the things that
makes<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.329> so<00:03:56.480> appealing<00:03:56.569> for<00:03:57.019> me<00:03:57.139> is<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.380> fact

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
makes it so appealing for me is the fact

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.800 
makes it so appealing for me is the fact
that<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.889> is<00:03:57.919> a<00:03:58.130> touchy<00:03:58.489> subject<00:03:58.819> it's<00:03:59.660> the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that it is a touchy subject it's the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.330 
that it is a touchy subject it's the
kind<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.079> thing<00:04:00.260> everybody<00:04:00.799> wonders<00:04:01.220> about

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
kind of thing everybody wonders about

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.250 
kind of thing everybody wonders about
and<00:04:01.730> everybody<00:04:02.090> talks<00:04:02.359> about<00:04:02.690> but<00:04:02.989> never

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
and everybody talks about but never

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.229 
and everybody talks about but never
publicly<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.459> twist<00:04:04.760> this<00:04:04.910> year<00:04:05.090> for

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
publicly the twist this year for

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.780 
publicly the twist this year for
survivors<00:04:05.720> obviously<00:04:06.260> provocative

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
survivors obviously provocative

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.559 
survivors obviously provocative
we<00:04:08.090> definitely<00:04:08.450> need<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.900> see<00:04:09.260> how<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.340> is

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
we definitely need to see how it is

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.110 
we definitely need to see how it is
executed<00:04:11.569> in<00:04:12.079> order<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.620> comment<00:04:13.159> on<00:04:13.430> its

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
executed in order to comment on its

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.069 
executed in order to comment on its
social<00:04:14.930> impact<00:04:15.890> I<00:04:16.220> think<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.639> causes<00:04:17.269> us<00:04:17.690> to

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
social impact I think it causes us to

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.420 
social impact I think it causes us to
still<00:04:18.739> think<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:21.259> differences<00:04:22.160> that

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
still think of the differences that

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.219 
still think of the differences that
exist<00:04:22.729> among<00:04:23.180> different<00:04:23.330> races<00:04:23.810> rather<00:04:24.080> than

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
exist among different races rather than

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.230 
exist among different races rather than
the<00:04:24.350> commonalities<00:04:24.979> I<00:04:25.280> have<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.699> problem<00:04:26.090> with

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
the commonalities I have a problem with
