 So who does not have the money now does not give 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.600
 To buy any more, but this one. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.600
 I bought this 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.620
 and there are others here on the okay side so lets 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.699
 I come back here and we go there for a mission 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.070
 Then you're there. 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.000
 The game is very simple, you assume a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.570
 Role that descend giant robot and goal 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.390
 is to protect here to say its base 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.829
 training here these planes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 in this third mission that we have planes 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.210
 They are kamikaze 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.550
 you have to be careful with them and each 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.250
 Once you build you win coins 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.510
 it's not with these coins you can buy 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.250
 new items new weapons and so on 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:21.950
 here below I have some you put 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.590
 the different starting and tightening I 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.230
 here in the blue team and releases a 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.200
 ray that destroys all airplanes, perhaps 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.120
 only're so game is quite hectic has 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.480
 various rooms for those who enjoy games 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.170
 Interlocution is sure to enjoy this 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.170
 game 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.660
 Ok, let's go there for the second game 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.420
 The second game is very different. 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.060
 fry enamel that has a tutorial when 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.910
 You go in. He explains how you play. 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.470
 simple goal that is to escape from a 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.320
 shark is 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.410
 The further away you get the more points. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.870
 You win more items you can buy 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.120
 then when the match is over so the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.660
 you can see that on top of it 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.940
 literally or diving is there when 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.399
 you hold tight 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.440
 He dived after a good jump. 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.660
 great 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.319
 for the time being the shark was not going 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.209
 behind 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.739
 but he appears there in a little while 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.319
 objective appeared 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.849
 the goal is to get away from him, nor am 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.159
 Doing now 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.200
 I really liked this game in the 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.989
 from art to the visual part also beautiful 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.180
 to perfect and very cool game is 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.939
 totally free and has a 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.310
 so the game paid what 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:41.480
 so this is the second game of today 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.349
 Let's go to the third game. 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.609
 The third game is the motocross meltdown 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.049
 a very crazy 3d game 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.879
 It's just a little different, I'm going 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.709
 show you how you have it here 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.230
 option for you to buy new motorbikes 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.980
 improve your bike to customize this is 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.500
 very cool is that it gives an opportunity to 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.599
 leave the bike the way you want it 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.370
 I'm going to go to the match to see 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.169
 how is it 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.189
 So, how did I say the game in 3d and graphics? 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.879
 very pretty 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:20.989
 the bike we go there and when this circus 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.180
 get here I squeeze the screen for him 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.280
 make the maneuver 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.689
 so it's not a game you control is 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.449
 the bike is not like that but it's the river type 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.989
 get there near the circle you 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.319
 he makes the maneuver of form 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.989
 correct 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.239
 It's that simple, but I found the 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.530
 environment is different and I found it 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.769
 funny 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.470
 so these were the three games of today 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.009
 As I always leave the link to 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:57.790
 download in the description I'm staying here 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:57.790
 A big hug and thanks
