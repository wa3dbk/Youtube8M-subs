I'm right anyway let's get into it David
the<00:00:29.400> hair<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.390> he<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> player<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the hair I think he was a player of the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
the hair I think he was a player of the
season<00:00:31.859> last<00:00:32.340> year<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> miserable

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
season last year and that miserable

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.920 
season last year and that miserable
season<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.110> had<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.670> he<00:00:35.670> remained<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.360> 83

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
season we had and he remained an 83

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.350 
season we had and he remained an 83
which<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.380> don't<00:00:37.440> agree<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
which I don't agree with I think the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.310 
which I don't agree with I think the
hair<00:00:39.680> should<00:00:40.680> definitely<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:42.230> 84<00:00:43.489> 85<00:00:44.489> maybe

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.250 

Rafael<00:00:50.000> 77<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.510> he's<00:00:51.660> been<00:00:51.870> underrated

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
Rafael 77 I think he's been underrated

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.180 
Rafael 77 I think he's been underrated
for<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.980> long<00:00:53.309> long<00:00:53.520> time<00:00:54.440> obviously<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
for a long long time obviously you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.000 
for a long long time obviously you
didn't<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> great<00:00:56.879> season<00:00:57.120> last<00:00:57.360> season

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
didn't have a great season last season

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.700 
didn't have a great season last season
but<00:00:59.510> 77<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.949> just<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.640> too<00:01:03.350> too<00:01:04.350> low

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
but 77 is just a little bit too too low

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
but 77 is just a little bit too too low
I'd<00:01:05.159> say<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.200> teep<00:01:07.850> I'd<00:01:08.850> even<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.180> content

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
I'd say and a teep I'd even be content

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.320 
I'd say and a teep I'd even be content
with<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> 17<00:01:10.320> I'll<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.010> TV<00:01:12.200> Phil<00:01:13.200> Jones

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
with a 17 I'll to be on TV Phil Jones

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.830 
with a 17 I'll to be on TV Phil Jones
adult<00:01:15.710> great<00:01:16.710> Phil<00:01:17.280> Jones<00:01:17.840> particularly

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
adult great Phil Jones particularly

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.670 
adult great Phil Jones particularly
highly<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.960> 17<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.140> probably<00:01:22.530> about

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
highly so I think 17 is probably about

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850 
highly so I think 17 is probably about
wreck<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.720> think<00:01:24.720> smalling's<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
wreck I think smalling's actually a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
wreck I think smalling's actually a
better<00:01:26.070> defender<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:27.030> Phil<00:01:27.360> Jones's<00:01:27.840> but

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
better defender of Phil Jones's but

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
better defender of Phil Jones's but
obviously<00:01:29.130> Smalling<00:01:29.670> Lacson<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
obviously Smalling Lacson is the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.310 
obviously Smalling Lacson is the
technical<00:01:31.049> side<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> game<00:01:32.180> Evans<00:01:33.320> 79

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
technical side of the game Evans 79

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
technical side of the game Evans 79
that's<00:01:34.920> unchanged<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:35.700> last<00:01:35.790> year<00:01:37.670> yeah<00:01:38.670> not

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that's unchanged from last year yeah not

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
that's unchanged from last year yeah not
much<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> say<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.810> he<00:01:40.020> hasn't<00:01:40.320> started<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
much to say there he hasn't started this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.899 
much to say there he hasn't started this
season<00:01:41.130> off<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.430> war<00:01:41.939> he's<00:01:42.899> looked<00:01:43.280> very<00:01:44.280> shaky

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
season off to war he's looked very shaky

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
season off to war he's looked very shaky
at<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> best<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.689> times<00:01:46.640> rojo<00:01:48.350> 79<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> think

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
at the best of times rojo 79 I think

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.670 
at the best of times rojo 79 I think
that's<00:01:49.890> plus<00:01:50.189> 2<00:01:50.600> from<00:01:51.600> his<00:01:51.780> rating<00:01:52.170> last<00:01:52.409> year

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that's plus 2 from his rating last year

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
that's plus 2 from his rating last year
think<00:01:52.979> he<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.220> 77<00:01:54.079> he<00:01:55.079> looks<00:01:55.290> solid<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:57.020> for

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
think he was a 77 he looks solid and for

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.440 
think he was a 77 he looks solid and for
now<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.740> probably<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.450> fair

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
now I think that's probably a fair

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.469 
now I think that's probably a fair
rating<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.000> haven't<00:02:03.240> seen

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
rating because I know I haven't seen

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.980 
rating because I know I haven't seen
that<00:02:03.540> much<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.899> them<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
that much of them so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.960 
that much of them so
we'll<00:02:05.890> see<00:02:06.070> how<00:02:06.130> he<00:02:06.159> gets<00:02:06.460> on<00:02:06.640> through<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
we'll see how he gets on through the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.440 
we'll see how he gets on through the
course<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.420> season<00:02:07.679> Luke<00:02:08.679> Shaw<00:02:09.090> 75<00:02:10.090> I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
course of the season Luke Shaw 75 I

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.420 
course of the season Luke Shaw 75 I
think<00:02:10.660> he's<00:02:10.780> gone<00:02:10.989> up<00:02:11.110> plus<00:02:11.470> one<00:02:11.860> from<00:02:12.220> last

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
think he's gone up plus one from last

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.360 
think he's gone up plus one from last
season<00:02:15.180> I'd<00:02:16.180> say<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.750> now<00:02:16.920> that's<00:02:17.920> probably

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
season I'd say for now that's probably

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.970 
season I'd say for now that's probably
about<00:02:18.730> right<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.569> still<00:02:20.140> need<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.349> kind<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.770> see

unchanged<00:02:36.780> think<00:02:37.780> he's<00:02:37.930> slightly<00:02:38.319> underrated

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
unchanged think he's slightly underrated

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.059 
unchanged think he's slightly underrated
to<00:02:39.220> be<00:02:39.340> honest<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.760> even<00:02:40.660> when<00:02:41.350> he<00:02:41.950> was

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
to be honest with you even when he was

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.420 
to be honest with you even when he was
at<00:02:42.190> Bilbao<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.670> thought<00:02:43.120> 17<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.870> was<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:44.709> little

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
at Bilbao I thought 17 I was a little

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.190 
at Bilbao I thought 17 I was a little
bit<00:02:45.519> too<00:02:45.730> low<00:02:45.910> probably<00:02:46.420> give<00:02:46.569> him<00:02:47.069> an<00:02:48.069> 81<00:02:49.200> and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
bit too low probably give him an 81 and

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.729 
bit too low probably give him an 81 and
80<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.100> very<00:02:51.340> least<00:02:53.430> DeMaria<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:56.290> he

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
80 at the very least DeMaria I think he

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.120 
80 at the very least DeMaria I think he
has<00:02:57.180> remained<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.390> same<00:02:58.720> think<00:02:59.200> he<00:02:59.290> was<00:02:59.410> an<00:02:59.560> 86

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
has remained the same think he was an 86

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.740 
has remained the same think he was an 86
on<00:03:00.310> fifa<00:03:00.760> 14<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.860> he's<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:03.060> 86<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.390> year<00:03:04.599> as

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
on fifa 14 and he's a 86 this year as

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.270 
on fifa 14 and he's a 86 this year as
well<00:03:05.430> now<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:07.410> think<00:03:09.780> 86<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.930> probably<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.890> cut

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
well now I think 86 is probably a cut

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.520 
well now I think 86 is probably a cut
you<00:03:12.489> know<00:03:12.609> maybe<00:03:12.880> that<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.329> point<00:03:13.600> Tula<00:03:16.530> one

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
you know maybe that one point Tula one

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.949 
you know maybe that one point Tula one
matter<00:03:17.859> I<00:03:18.340> think<00:03:19.150> he's<00:03:19.239> been<00:03:19.420> enough<00:03:19.660> by<00:03:19.900> two

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
matter I think he's been enough by two

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.630 
matter I think he's been enough by two
points<00:03:20.440> he<00:03:20.829> was<00:03:20.950> an<00:03:21.040> 87<00:03:21.760> on<00:03:21.880> fifa<00:03:22.810> 14<00:03:23.609> now<00:03:24.609> he's

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
points he was an 87 on fifa 14 now he's

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.449 
points he was an 87 on fifa 14 now he's
an<00:03:24.850> 85<00:03:25.390> which<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.440> bit<00:03:26.859> harsh<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:28.769> think<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.859> 86

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
an 85 which is a bit harsh I think in 86

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.720 
an 85 which is a bit harsh I think in 86
would<00:03:31.000> probably<00:03:31.359> be<00:03:31.480> probably<00:03:32.200> be<00:03:32.730> slightly

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
would probably be probably be slightly

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.300 
would probably be probably be slightly
fairer<00:03:34.799> Wayne<00:03:35.799> Rooney<00:03:36.579> um<00:03:38.549> not<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.850> particular

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
fairer Wayne Rooney um not a particular

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.140 
fairer Wayne Rooney um not a particular
I'm<00:03:42.310> not<00:03:42.519> Wayne<00:03:42.700> Rooney's<00:03:43.060> biggest<00:03:43.510> fan<00:03:43.750> and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
I'm not Wayne Rooney's biggest fan and

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.479 
I'm not Wayne Rooney's biggest fan and
he's<00:03:46.150> been<00:03:46.299> nerfed<00:03:46.600> by<00:03:46.900> was<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.290> one<00:03:47.590> point<00:03:47.920> on

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
he's been nerfed by was it one point on

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.660 
he's been nerfed by was it one point on
last<00:03:48.880> year<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.739> I'm<00:03:50.739> sure<00:03:50.980> over<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.340> course

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
last year and I'm sure over the course

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.949 
last year and I'm sure over the course
of<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.940> next<00:03:52.090> couple<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.480> years<00:03:52.569> he'll

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
of the next couple of years he'll

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.340 
of the next couple of years he'll
probably<00:03:53.200> go<00:03:53.470> down<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.100> an<00:03:54.220> 82<00:03:54.670> because

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
probably go down to like an 82 because

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.870 
probably go down to like an 82 because
slowly<00:03:56.350> slowly<00:03:56.799> people<00:03:57.220> are<00:03:57.489> beginning<00:03:57.639> to

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
slowly slowly people are beginning to

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.240 
slowly slowly people are beginning to
see<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.359> he's<00:03:58.780> really<00:03:59.260> not<00:03:59.470> and<00:04:00.220> probably

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
see that he's really not and probably

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.170 
see that he's really not and probably
never<00:04:00.790> has<00:04:01.090> been<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.359> world-class<00:04:03.000> Robin<00:04:04.000> van

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
never has been a world-class Robin van

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.309 
never has been a world-class Robin van
Persie's<00:04:04.780> gone<00:04:05.290> down<00:04:06.000> from<00:04:07.000> an<00:04:07.120> 89<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:07.810> last

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
Persie's gone down from an 89 on last

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.970 
Persie's gone down from an 89 on last
year<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:09.700> he's<00:04:09.850> an<00:04:10.000> 88<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.780> year<00:04:11.109> it's

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
year and he's an 88 this year it's

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.309 
year and he's an 88 this year it's
probably<00:04:12.250> fair

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
probably fair

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.009 
probably fair
many<00:04:14.310> night<00:04:14.549> had<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.790> terrible<00:04:15.180> season<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:15.959> you

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
many night had a terrible season so you

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.590 
many night had a terrible season so you
would<00:04:16.590> kind<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.889> expect<00:04:17.039> a<00:04:17.759> lot<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.000> players<00:04:18.239> to

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
would kind of expect a lot of players to

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.550 
would kind of expect a lot of players to
to<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:19.769> down<00:04:20.070> by<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.370> point<00:04:20.699> or<00:04:20.880> two<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.570> um<00:04:21.900> yeah

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
to go down by a point or two so um yeah

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.490 
to go down by a point or two so um yeah
probably<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.400> bar<00:04:23.580> at<00:04:24.020> Lindegaard<00:04:25.020> stay<00:04:25.320> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
probably a bar at Lindegaard stay the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.980 
probably a bar at Lindegaard stay the
same<00:04:25.740> doesn't<00:04:26.280> really<00:04:26.550> play<00:04:26.729> so<00:04:26.850> not<00:04:27.419> really

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
same doesn't really play so not really

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.650 
same doesn't really play so not really
worth<00:04:28.289> analyzing<00:04:29.750> Smalling<00:04:31.910> 76<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.210> probably

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
worth analyzing Smalling 76 is probably

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.730 
worth analyzing Smalling 76 is probably
harsh<00:04:33.990> but<00:04:34.580> at<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.669> same<00:04:35.880> time<00:04:36.150> when<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:37.500> most

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
harsh but at the same time when and most

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.430 
harsh but at the same time when and most
people<00:04:38.060> see<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.180> play<00:04:39.389> right<00:04:39.660> back<00:04:39.930> that's

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
people see and play right back that's

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.430 
people see and play right back that's
not<00:04:40.680> its<00:04:40.830> position<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.900> obviously<00:04:42.900> he's<00:04:43.410> not

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
not its position so obviously he's not

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.920 
not its position so obviously he's not
really<00:04:43.800> gonna<00:04:43.979> be<00:04:44.160> rated<00:04:44.490> too<00:04:44.669> highly<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.300> do

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
really gonna be rated too highly I do

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.770 
really gonna be rated too highly I do
think<00:04:46.380> he's<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.530> better<00:04:46.849> defender<00:04:47.849> the<00:04:48.479> Phil

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
think he's a better defender the Phil

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.560 
think he's a better defender the Phil
Jones<00:04:49.050> but<00:04:49.590> he<00:04:49.979> needs<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.639> improve<00:04:51.150> on<00:04:51.419> its

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
Jones but he needs to improve on its

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.439 
Jones but he needs to improve on its
technical<00:04:52.080> side<00:04:52.580> especially<00:04:53.580> his<00:04:54.180> long

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
technical side especially his long

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.990 
technical side especially his long
passing<00:04:55.520> carex<00:04:56.520> gone<00:04:56.789> down<00:04:57.030> from<00:04:57.330> an<00:04:57.710> 8279<00:04:59.000> not

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
very good ball couple so you think maybe

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.300 
very good ball couple so you think maybe
a<00:05:46.169> 79<00:05:46.919> is<00:05:47.130> maybe<00:05:48.120> a<00:05:48.300> little<00:05:48.449> too<00:05:48.599> low<00:05:49.310> thinking

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
a 79 is maybe a little too low thinking

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
was a 79 on fifa 14 as well so Falcao he

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
was an 89 last year I'm not sure why Lee

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.080 
was an 89 last year I'm not sure why Lee
not<00:06:01.620> sure<00:06:01.800> why<00:06:01.949> they<00:06:02.130> nerfed<00:06:02.370> him<00:06:02.610> by<00:06:02.729> a<00:06:02.759> point

not sure why they nerfed him by a point

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.420 
not sure why they nerfed him by a point
maybe<00:06:03.419> he<00:06:03.960> didn't<00:06:04.199> have<00:06:04.320> a<00:06:04.349> great<00:06:04.710> season<00:06:05.070> at

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
maybe he didn't have a great season at

maybe he didn't have a great season at
Monaco<00:06:05.880> I'm<00:06:06.030> not<00:06:06.210> sure<00:06:06.449> or<00:06:07.050> maybe<00:06:07.099> with<00:06:08.099> due<00:06:08.250> to

Amos doesn't play for lady he's gone

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
Amos doesn't play for lady he's gone
down<00:06:14.300> by<00:06:14.510> one<00:06:14.750> point<00:06:14.990> which<00:06:15.530> is<00:06:15.640> deserved<00:06:17.080> and

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
down by one point which is deserved and

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.890 
down by one point which is deserved and
the<00:06:18.440> CERN<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:18.740> think<00:06:19.550> the<00:06:19.820> less<00:06:20.060> said<00:06:20.420> about<00:06:20.480> him

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
the CERN I think the less said about him

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.990 
the CERN I think the less said about him
the<00:06:21.080> better<00:06:22.720> Fletcher<00:06:24.640> unfortunate<00:06:25.640> to<00:06:25.790> say<00:06:25.970> I

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
the better Fletcher unfortunate to say I

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.910 
the better Fletcher unfortunate to say I
think<00:06:26.300> he's<00:06:26.450> finished<00:06:26.840> with<00:06:26.900> a<00:06:27.050> footballer<00:06:27.470> so

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
think he's finished with a footballer so

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.300 
think he's finished with a footballer so
um<00:06:28.250> yeah<00:06:28.970> he<00:06:29.810> best<00:06:29.990> only<00:06:30.170> one<00:06:31.090> actually<00:06:32.090> young

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
um yeah he best only one actually young

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.120 
um yeah he best only one actually young
similar<00:06:34.310> for<00:06:34.580> Antonio<00:06:35.450> Valencia<00:06:36.020> he's<00:06:36.230> just<00:06:36.800> I

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
similar for Antonio Valencia he's just I

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.970 
similar for Antonio Valencia he's just I
think<00:06:37.490> the<00:06:37.610> sooner<00:06:38.020> he's<00:06:39.020> out<00:06:39.260> at<00:06:39.440> a<00:06:39.500> club<00:06:39.530> the

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
think the sooner he's out at a club the

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
think the sooner he's out at a club the
better<00:06:40.300> but<00:06:41.300> he's<00:06:41.480> gone<00:06:41.660> down<00:06:41.930> by<00:06:42.110> one<00:06:42.320> point

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
better but he's gone down by one point

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.960 
better but he's gone down by one point
to<00:06:44.000> a<00:06:44.030> 78<00:06:44.810> still<00:06:45.740> at<00:06:45.860> Pace<00:06:46.010> mushrik<00:06:46.520> know<00:06:46.670> so<00:06:46.880> i

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
to a 78 still at Pace mushrik know so i

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.690 
to a 78 still at Pace mushrik know so i
guess<00:06:47.650> for<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:48.770> pace<00:06:48.980> whores<00:06:49.250> out<00:06:49.370> there<00:06:49.580> he's

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
guess for the pace whores out there he's

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.320 
guess for the pace whores out there he's
probably<00:06:49.910> still<00:06:50.270> worth<00:06:50.630> worth<00:06:51.590> playing

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
probably still worth worth playing

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.570 
probably still worth worth playing
