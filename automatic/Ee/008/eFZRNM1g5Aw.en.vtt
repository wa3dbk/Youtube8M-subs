00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
recycling bin and then you got Internet

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.119 
recycling bin and then you got Internet

Explorer so first off we need you an
Internet<00:00:41.489> Explorer<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.890> first<00:00:44.129> thing<00:00:44.250> we

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
Internet Explorer and the first thing we

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
Internet Explorer and the first thing we

want to do is get Google Chrome because

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
want to do is get Google Chrome because
that's<00:00:45.989> probably<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.410> best<00:00:46.590> stuff<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.100> it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
you how to our myopic computer are you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.360 
you how to our myopic computer are you
gonna<00:02:16.629> do<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> create<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.170> text<00:02:17.439> file<00:02:17.590> run<00:02:17.920> run

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
gonna do is create a text file run run

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.270 
gonna do is create a text file run run
dot<00:02:18.610> bat<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.239> rename<00:02:20.079> it<00:02:20.110> prep<00:02:20.620> with<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:20.980> and

dot bat and rename it prep with that and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.729 
dot bat and rename it prep with that and
it's<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:21.970> pretty<00:02:22.090> easy<00:02:22.329> and<00:02:22.629> once<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.590> have

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
it's just pretty easy and once you have

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.250 
it's just pretty easy and once you have
it<00:02:23.769> running<00:02:24.069> you'll<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.879> get<00:02:25.030> about<00:02:25.840> four<00:02:26.170> of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
it running you'll just get about four of

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.199 
it running you'll just get about four of
these<00:02:26.349> or<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:27.040> will<00:02:27.549> actually<00:02:27.879> if<00:02:28.030> you're

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
these or just will actually if you're

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.490 
these or just will actually if you're
running<00:02:28.450> one<00:02:28.569> server<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.019> get<00:02:29.140> one<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.379> these

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
running one server you get one of these

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.349 
running one server you get one of these
but<00:02:30.310> we're<00:02:30.489> running<00:02:30.579> a<00:02:30.730> hub<00:02:30.909> server<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.329> we

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
but we're running a hub server so we

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.479 
but we're running a hub server so we
have<00:02:31.510> four<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.900> these<00:02:31.959> open<00:02:32.379> and<00:02:32.829> each<00:02:33.069> each

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
have four of these open and each each

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.160 
have four of these open and each each
one<00:02:33.549> is<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.849> different<00:02:33.939> server<00:02:34.359> and<00:02:34.599> they're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
one is a different server and they're

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.940 
one is a different server and they're
all<00:02:35.290> running<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:35.590> different<00:02:35.680> boards<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:37.950> with

name it minecraft and that will open the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.740 
name it minecraft and that will open the
port<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.709> allows<00:03:18.040> people<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.629> connect<00:03:19.629> to

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
port and it allows people to connect to

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.559 
port and it allows people to connect to
your<00:03:19.840> server<00:03:20.400> now<00:03:21.400> if<00:03:21.849> you<00:03:22.000> want<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.329> have

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
your server now if you want to have

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.880 
your server now if you want to have
different<00:03:22.959> servers<00:03:23.409> you<00:03:23.500> need<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.739> open

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
different servers you need to open

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.390 
different servers you need to open
different<00:03:24.489> types<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.849> ports<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.629> yeah<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:27.280> can

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
different types of ports so yeah you can

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.589 
different types of ports so yeah you can
only<00:03:27.489> have<00:03:27.610> one<00:03:27.640> server<00:03:28.090> running<00:03:28.329> on<00:03:28.480> each

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
only have one server running on each

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.599 
only have one server running on each
port<00:03:28.930> which<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.739> kind<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.510> if<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:32.609> actually

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
port which is kind of it if it actually

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.030 
port which is kind of it if it actually
gets<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.879> way<00:03:33.970> sometimes<00:03:34.030> um<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.650> if<00:03:35.920> you

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
gets in the way sometimes um so if you

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.710 
gets in the way sometimes um so if you
accidentally<00:03:36.549> exit<00:03:37.000> right<00:03:37.120> out<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.420> this

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
accidentally exit right out of this

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.720 
accidentally exit right out of this
the<00:03:38.349> port<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.859> open<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.400> need<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.640> open

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
the port is open so you need to open

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.300 
the port is open so you need to open
your<00:03:39.849> task<00:03:40.120> manager<00:03:40.890> users<00:03:41.890> won't<00:03:41.980> be<00:03:42.129> lying

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
your task manager users won't be lying

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.589 
your task manager users won't be lying
down<00:03:42.519> there<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.760> have<00:03:42.879> to<00:03:42.970> go<00:03:43.060> search<00:03:43.269> for<00:03:43.299> it

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
down there you have to go search for it

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.780 
down there you have to go search for it
um<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.170> then<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.829> go<00:03:44.920> down<00:03:45.010> here<00:03:45.069> close<00:03:45.760> the
