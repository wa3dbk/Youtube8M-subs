yeah<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.730> you<00:01:56.760> basically<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.540> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
yeah and then you basically you just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.500 
yeah and then you basically you just
drop<00:01:58.380> let's<00:01:58.860> go
