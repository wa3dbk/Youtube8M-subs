00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hey people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.309
 more video here at battlefield and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.799
 you see here now now the moment here 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 defend the mobile station okay you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.609
 See also the bottom left somehow 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.840
 one has flags and the other 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 somehow a bar racist racist 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.990
 unfortunately , pte currently only and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.330
 also just on the card chucky and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.110
 Of course, of course, you quickly know one 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.270
 operate 2 is pretty nice fun 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.790
 we are here for a very short time now 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.820
 short-term gameplay on the defender 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.950
 side up to the camping and so me 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.050
 must say how the attackers have 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 it is very difficult so it is not easy 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 then not too strong 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.360
 already played 23 munich 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.309
 you already see me as level 1 so 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 I have no plan here on I have 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.780
 So I do not know now, so to speak 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.390
 this larger and also simply striking 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 run very differently here is really very 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 I've never played fancy peck 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.170
 to say that's why I'm here yes 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.450
 870 over ten meters short 3 mm what 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.390
 It's too quick to say, so it's quick 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.430
 Ingenious makes huge fun just the problem 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.259
 is easy you see you need me 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.750
 Eternal up to how I happen to be mine 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.580
 I have to go all the way and it is disturbing 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.740
 actually stretched too far back 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.000
 that is, I find in life so annoying 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.130
 especially now now at the beginning 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 I'm not this Increased sprint 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 I'll take forever until I return 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.610
 I am a front man and of course surprised 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.610
 actually, that's what you need 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 teamplay squads etc I find missing here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 So I mean I have palermo too 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.259
 problems garden other games and that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.970
 is then a problem if you then 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.790
 no sport has then synonymous equal 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 little people it's just the team 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.340
 readiness here and the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.619
 Helpfulness is not really there 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 So what I have experienced a bit too 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.750
 I do not know how that affects 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.610
 will be on permanent 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.870
 guess the game would be really fun 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 If so with a few times 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.159
 Colleagues play the game really nice 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.649
 Dignity will be really exciting 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.569
 do 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.610
 a good round but so I think so 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.400
 Now real team is not really one 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.209
 team so here everyone looks something like that himself 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.410
 But it can be enough anyway 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.330
 Real fun so here it goes 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.380
 always 25 instead of radio station a and b and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.970
 attacks me as a sheep with e 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.510
 could with the races can be 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.459
 make up 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.320
 as a defender could then again in 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.560
 defuse 30 seconds I have to believe 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.640
 I'm running, I'm sure 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.780
 attacking 100 tickets for the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.330
 past them so that the fender 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.720
 won the m combs have destroyed 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.150
 who turned to her and yes there is here 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.910
 only and never as currently so there 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.050
 nine down and always has one on the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.390
 then on the other side then 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.580
 is invited to play 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.709
 and if now, of course you will know the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.360
 in the game what so the defenders 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.260
 the attackers mean the same 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.730
 Excuse me 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.900
 the attackers already have here 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.260
 So we do not have it 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.000
 managed to completely destroy ours 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.739
 is always defused in time 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.450
 you'll see right now, too 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.579
 you 'll blink down here two times 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.290
 if you can escape where now 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.630
 is there looks around the number and have 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.959
 they also flash so sexy down in the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.290
 picture and her epic fei with the ex 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.810
 not my pistol 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.390
 but what I mean by that is the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.440
 if it is really good then it can 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.890
 make fun and take a bit longer 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.510
 longer 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.239
 but if really the fan 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.920
 reports dominated it is a bit tough her 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.890
 look here just defused factor 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.049
 the story but I'm real that is 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.049
 new one so i had noticed last 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.090
 time completely barely played any videos 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.890
 really only very very much 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.840
 Rare and I do not have anymore 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.340
 games because there is no fun 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.060
 has done more for me at the moment will 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.360
 I have already with the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.890
 thoughts played a while whiz too 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.630
 let play trophy and no longer bock 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.420
 to make videos and so but I have to 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.160
 say if it's really that way here 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.530
 fun so I have here the few rounds 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.840
 At the beginning I packed it again 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.670
 which two nights longer no longer 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.539
 played more playoffs but slowly 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.430
 So it's just fun for them 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.970
 if unfortunately, of course, squad is now 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.130
 not a pity but well what the hell 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.330
 still makes a bit of a whim and 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.039
 So I think I am looking forward now 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.960
 could playoffs normally I do have a 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.660
 let stand you see me every 249 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.560
 walk around and get upgraded and narac 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.270
 a defibrillator so yes should be 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.400
 a few level rise is definitely up 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.470
 more buck and of course turns here 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.940
 really a team is where people are again 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.300
 revive mmo give the like hegel 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.310
 it really does not work to destroy it 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.539
 the power has been a long time but so so 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.010
 right now is no no but me 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.380
 Do not want to talk bad 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.910
 In any case, huge mood but that 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.440
 would be quite improvement things 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.200
 give and it is also a bit buggy 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.900
 when somehow there was nobody and 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.729
 this has simply gone up, says 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.490
 well, of course, pcr test festgÃ¤sten is 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.780
 here only now brings a whole 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.400
 short video about you 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.710
 could imagine what it looks like 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 right now it's on Schalke I would 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.699
 I do not recommend 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.580
 get pte and load is just 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:31.729
 a bit of a role model for her url bar 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.440
 Enter above pte and then showed already 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.070
 ab spd is there then still on top 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.300
 pte public test environment and then 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.039
 just sign up for a new one 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.139
 account and that will also see her 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.509
 you can now for example an 870 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.509
 kombat bf3 edition for two credits den 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.430
 day in the lineup 500 starter credits as im 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.590
 normal and you can also the 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.130
 Weapons, for example, on the tt it but 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.050
 So do not buy for the unlock price 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.400
 would have to unlock it to buy 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.960
 can 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.190
 I think many of you play pte that 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.289
 is not great to explain 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.030
 but I would say it's too long 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.370
 now can play yet here comes the 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.370
 quick videos a few for the first time 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.199
 round as defender to camping so me 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.060
 i am just stop i hope i could 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.610
 I give a little feedback as quickly 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.389
 so you is here in the in the 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.120
 swimming pool 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.460
 since it would then also scratch and 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.530
 noise is heard again 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.810
 So that's kind of that was not one 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.180
 clue but the pool that they are 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.610
 everyone in there and I have to say real 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.080
 quick tables-16 new possibility in the 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.870
 ried opponent can flank you wonderfully 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.580
 So maybe I'm good new 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.320
 game mode was a long time in conversation what 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.240
 is coming soon is definitely now 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.280
 confirmation 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.169
 and I think it's gonna say huge 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.330
 recommendation is really fun if you 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.620
 have a decent team as an attacker 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.020
 a bit difficult is here right now 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.150
 after sharky and as I said I know 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.370
 not how many m is how many 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.650
 in comparis the bfr gives softline 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.120
 played but briefly a short video 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.860
 I hope I could give you something closer 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.630
 bring and at the weekend will be more 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.979
 fast videos come so offense 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.979
 are so party
