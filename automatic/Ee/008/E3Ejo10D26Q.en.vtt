00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.859
 maxi style size to sell and a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.349
 value for money among the most 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.309
 competitive and alluring of the whole 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.139
 category 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 we are talking about the opel insignia 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.250
 approved by our andrea nicoli in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.310
 usual test of the week in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.410
 bi fuel version is powered by a motor 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.539
 1400 petrol turbo with 140 horses 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.400
 also powered by LPG 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.400
 let's go and listen to his impressions 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.630
 opel insignia sportour the flagship 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.090
 of the German house with a large one 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.750
 load capacity up to 1,500 liters 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.930
 4 meters long 91 only 4 cm more than the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.700
 4-door version and certainly one 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 multi-purpose machine especially with 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.379
 this engine on appeal they call gpl 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 tech is thought under this big one 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.270
 car there is a small 1300 engine 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.820
 60 petrol turbos with 140 horsepower 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.379
 so over 100 horses per liter but with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.149
 something more bifuel power 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.159
 because in addition to the petrol supply 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.229
 can also work with gpl for the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.990
 benefit of the consumption of the costs of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 autonomy management 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.930
 another aspect extremely 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.150
 interesting that the GPS system installed 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.600
 directly to Russian and shane at home 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.979
 home page 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.229
 what does an engine set for? 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.909
 this demanding and a well tank 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 installed instead of the wheel of 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.540
 buffer stock 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.060
 opel undoubtedly awards a car 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.980
 comfortable both in the spaces but also 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.930
 in the dimensions of the seat in the 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.110
 suspensions that filter very well every 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.150
 expert of the fund and together the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.000
 classic coatings are good 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.280
 quality 140 horses are more than that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.290
 enough to move us in each 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.200
 condition so that the acceleration 0 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.210
 100 is just over 13 seconds e 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.280
 where possible, perhaps 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.590
 reach 190 km per hour 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.170
 I was saying an engine that starts well again 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.180
 every gear very elastic using a little 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.290
 of gasoline they use or lpg they are crossed 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.360
 on average 12 13 even 14 km of john with 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.420
 general autonomy thought over 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.429
 1,500 lire because of the tank 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.750
 of the aventino we join in 42 liters 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.750
 available for LPG 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.250
 the nine have always been very adept at 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.489
 build station wagons and insignia 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.500
 sports tourer in the classic example 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.810
 think of a spacious car e 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.269
 extremely pleasant comfortable from 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.090
 drive with 140 engine 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.069
 horses and also extremely economical 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.640
 in management costs because the LPG will 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.349
 know 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.000
 it costs little to the pump not 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.310
 let us also forget the price of 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.200
 car just under â‚¬ 31,000 in the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.659
 cosmo version, however, more equipped 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.060
 what gpl means means only a thousand 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.030
 euros more than the simple version 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.010
 gasoline with the same performance and vi 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.959
 remember a lpg mounted at the factory 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.769
 therefore reliable with the same guarantee 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.769
 of the car
