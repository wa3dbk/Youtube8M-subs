00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
color I think you're supposed to stick

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:41.050 
color I think you're supposed to stick
your<00:01:35.220> hard-boiled<00:01:35.520> egg<00:01:37.490> into<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> rice<00:01:39.050> and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
your hard-boiled egg into the rice and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:51.730 
your hard-boiled egg into the rice and
put<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> lid<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:42.929> give<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.649> shake

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.620 

now<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.800> kid<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.460> cup<00:01:53.819> so<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.330> was<00:01:54.420> like

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
now the kid it was a cup so it was like

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:13.130 
now the kid it was a cup so it was like
it<00:01:54.899> did<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.319> little<00:01:55.440> better<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.830> think<00:02:12.140> give

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
it did it a little better I think give

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.479 
it did it a little better I think give
that<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> minute<00:02:13.620> while<00:02:13.860> we<00:02:13.890> shake<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
that a minute while we shake up the

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.630 
that a minute while we shake up the
other<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:15.530> there's<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.739> egg<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.310> gonna<00:02:17.459> give

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
other one there's the egg I'm gonna give

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.599 
other one there's the egg I'm gonna give
it<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.820> shake<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.680> probably<00:02:19.950> easier<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.519> a

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
it a shake this is probably easier in a

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.190 
it a shake this is probably easier in a
cup<00:02:20.880> because<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.390> would<00:02:21.480> cover<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.959> egg<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
cup because it would cover the egg a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.780 
cup because it would cover the egg a
little<00:02:22.380> better<00:02:28.040> all<00:02:29.040> right<00:02:29.250> I'm<00:02:29.370> gonna<00:02:29.459> shake

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
little better all right I'm gonna shake

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.610 
little better all right I'm gonna shake
these<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> couple<00:02:30.329> more<00:02:30.480> minutes<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.019> then<00:02:31.350> I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
these a couple more minutes and then I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.039 
these a couple more minutes and then I
will<00:02:31.769> show<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.489> they<00:02:32.579> look<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:33.049> so

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
will show you what they look like so
