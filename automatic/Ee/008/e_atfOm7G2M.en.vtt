mirrorless cameras have a smaller

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.580 
mirrorless cameras have a smaller
battery<00:01:43.500> than<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> DSLR<00:01:44.479> DSLR<00:01:45.479> glass<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.049> big<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
battery than a DSLR DSLR glass is big it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
battery than a DSLR DSLR glass is big it
has<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:47.040> mass<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.369> takes<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:48.030> energy<00:01:48.180> to

mirrorless<00:01:58.079> camera<00:01:58.439> system<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.610> cuts

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
mirrorless camera system and really cuts

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
mirrorless camera system and really cuts
your<00:02:00.060> runtime<00:02:00.329> down<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.380> small<00:02:01.530> amount

your runtime down to a very small amount
so<00:02:02.460> here's<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> idea<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.590> kind<00:02:04.829> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so here's the idea I know it's kind of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.560 
so here's the idea I know it's kind of
hard<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.939> got<00:02:06.210> all<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.509> money

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
hard to think you got all this money

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.869 
hard to think you got all this money
invested<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.469> DSLR<00:02:07.920> stuff<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
invested in your DSLR stuff but the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.420 
invested in your DSLR stuff but the
bottom<00:02:09.179> line<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> once<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.619> start<00:02:11.099> realizing

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
bottom line is once you start realizing

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.360 
bottom line is once you start realizing
that<00:02:12.209> these<00:02:12.420> smaller

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
that these smaller

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.759 
that these smaller
mirrorless<00:02:14.090> cameras<00:02:14.629> will<00:02:14.930> make<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.590> vast

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
mirrorless cameras will make the vast

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.589 
mirrorless cameras will make the vast
majority<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> people<00:02:16.580> watching<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.090> life<00:02:17.360> a

majority of people watching this life a

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.140 
majority of people watching this life a
lot<00:02:17.810> easier<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:19.190> once<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> get<00:02:19.879> over<00:02:19.909> that

lot easier and once you get over that
whole<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.810> know<00:02:20.930> sensor<00:02:21.319> size<00:02:21.560> thing

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
whole you know sensor size thing

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.039 
whole you know sensor size thing
whatever<00:02:22.129> that's<00:02:22.459> all<00:02:22.640> about<00:02:22.790> you'll<00:02:23.450> realize
