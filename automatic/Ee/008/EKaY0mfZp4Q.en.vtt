or<00:00:35.100> an<00:00:35.190> off-road<00:00:35.430> truck<00:00:35.610> period<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:37.110> what

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
or an off-road truck period that do what

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.600 
or an off-road truck period that do what
I<00:00:37.290> did<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.530> removed<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> turret

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
I did I removed the turret

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.690 
I did I removed the turret
i<00:00:38.989> weighted<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> down<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.100> flexes<00:00:41.309> better

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
i weighted it down so it flexes better

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.990 
i weighted it down so it flexes better
keeps<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> wheels<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> ground<00:00:45.530> and

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
keeps all the wheels on the ground and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
keeps all the wheels on the ground and
the<00:00:48.000> suspension<00:00:48.390> has<00:00:48.600> been<00:00:48.780> modified<00:00:49.140> this

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the suspension has been modified this

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.040 
the suspension has been modified this
one<00:00:49.559> also<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.120> linkage<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.870> went

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
one also there was a linkage that went

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.580 
one also there was a linkage that went
from<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.160> both<00:00:53.399> sides<00:00:54.590> right

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
from here to here on both sides right

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.400 
from here to here on both sides right
there<00:00:55.800> right<00:00:56.670> there<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.199> removed<00:00:58.199> those

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
there right there I removed those

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
there right there I removed those
linkages<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.640> those<00:00:59.850> stopped<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.329> from

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
linkages because those stopped it from

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.290 
linkages because those stopped it from
flexing<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.170> down<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> max

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
flexing up and down you know to the max

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.370 
flexing up and down you know to the max
I<00:01:03.890> also<00:01:04.890> replace<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> springs<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.930> softer

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I also replace the springs with softer

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.000 
I also replace the springs with softer
Springs<00:01:08.060> now<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.299> flexes<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.810> crazy<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
Springs now it flexes like crazy and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.969 
Springs now it flexes like crazy and
I'll<00:01:11.130> show<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.399 

now<00:01:19.549> when<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.509> when<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.810> got<00:01:20.960> this<00:01:21.110> thing<00:01:21.259> it

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
now when I when I got this thing it

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.550 
now when I when I got this thing it
would<00:01:21.500> not<00:01:21.710> flex<00:01:22.009> near<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.369> much<00:01:23.409> they<00:01:24.409> can

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
would not flex near that much they can

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.539 
would not flex near that much they can
see<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:24.860> that's<00:01:24.979> us<00:01:25.219> flex<00:01:25.520> quite<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:25.969> bit<00:01:27.549> and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
see that that's us flex quite a bit and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.889 
see that that's us flex quite a bit and
also<00:01:28.909> when<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.210> take<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.450> turret<00:01:29.659> off

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
also when you take the turret off

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.850 
also when you take the turret off
there's<00:01:30.590> actually<00:01:30.920> two<00:01:31.100> plugs<00:01:31.429> that<00:01:31.759> unplug

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
there's actually two plugs that unplug

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.169 
there's actually two plugs that unplug
and<00:01:33.860> if<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.039> know<00:01:34.159> what<00:01:34.280> you're<00:01:34.399> doing<00:01:34.729> you

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
can hook lights or a homemade winch up

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.510 
can hook lights or a homemade winch up
to<00:01:39.799> those<00:01:39.950> plugs<00:01:40.299> because<00:01:42.009> these<00:01:43.009> buttons

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
to those plugs because these buttons

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.410 
to those plugs because these buttons
right<00:01:43.939> here<00:01:45.159> control<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.310> turret<00:01:46.670> up<00:01:47.149> and

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
right here control the turret up and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.179 
right here control the turret up and
down<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.719> side<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.990> side<00:01:48.200> now<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.069> you'd

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
down the side to side now what you'd

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.460 
down the side to side now what you'd
have<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.369> do<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:50.719> should<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:50.959> to<00:01:51.049> take<00:01:51.229> this

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
have to do you should have to take this

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.320

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
off and you have to put an actual switch

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.910 
off and you have to put an actual switch
in<00:01:53.479> there<00:01:53.630> instead<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.259> just<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.470> push<00:01:54.649> button

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
in there instead of just a push button

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.559 
in there instead of just a push button
that<00:01:55.549> way<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.700> can<00:01:55.849> turn<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.119> on<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.240> leave<00:01:56.450> it

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
that way you can turn it on and leave it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.980 
that way you can turn it on and leave it
on

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.029 

now<00:01:59.990> as<00:02:00.289> for<00:02:00.679> power<00:02:01.630> I'm<00:02:02.630> in<00:02:02.959> the<00:02:03.049> process<00:02:03.259> I'm

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.240 

a<00:02:07.039> hook<00:02:07.220> an<00:02:07.489> 18<00:02:07.849> volt<00:02:08.619> rechargeable<00:02:09.619> battery

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
a hook an 18 volt rechargeable battery

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.720 
a hook an 18 volt rechargeable battery
up<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.549> it<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.360> all<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.450> comes<00:02:11.660> with<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> 9.6

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
up to it and all that comes with a 9.6

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.569 
up to it and all that comes with a 9.6
so<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.940> should<00:02:14.060> be<00:02:14.150> pretty<00:02:14.299> interesting<00:02:14.569> um

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
so it should be pretty interesting um

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.670 
so it should be pretty interesting um
the<00:02:16.579> only<00:02:16.700> downfall<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.540> these<00:02:17.660> trucks<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:18.260> you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the only downfall of these trucks is you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.309 
the only downfall of these trucks is you
cannot<00:02:18.950> modify<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.849> gears<00:02:20.239> at<00:02:20.450> all<00:02:20.569> not<00:02:21.200> that

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
cannot modify the gears at all not that
