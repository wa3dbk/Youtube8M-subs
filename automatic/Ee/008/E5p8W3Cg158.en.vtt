now once you've drilled that first hole
you<00:00:59.890> can<00:01:00.039> actually<00:01:00.190> take<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.730> plate<00:01:01.379> put<00:01:02.379> it

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
you can actually take the plate put it

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.730 
you can actually take the plate put it
on<00:01:02.649> there<00:01:02.859> and<00:01:03.039> take<00:01:03.489> one<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.470> bolts<00:01:05.470> and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
on there and take one of the bolts and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.770 
on there and take one of the bolts and
push<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.640> through<00:01:06.670> there<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.210> make<00:01:07.390> sure<00:01:07.600> that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
push it through there to make sure that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.020 
push it through there to make sure that
you<00:01:07.930> stay<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.200> target<00:01:08.560> with<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.549> rest<00:01:09.760> of<00:01:09.909> your

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
you stay on target with the rest of your

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:23.399 
you stay on target with the rest of your
drilling<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.830> can<00:01:20.979> pull<00:01:21.189> these<00:01:21.369> out<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.020> put

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
drilling you can pull these out and put

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.539 
drilling you can pull these out and put
some<00:01:23.619> marine<00:01:23.950> goop<00:01:24.280> on<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:25.390> shaft<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:26.259> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
some marine goop on the shaft of the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.179 
some marine goop on the shaft of the
bolts<00:01:27.549> and<00:01:27.790> that<00:01:28.780> way<00:01:28.960> when<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.710> attach<00:01:30.009> them

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
bolts and that way when you attach them

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.730 
bolts and that way when you attach them
on<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.460> inside<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.930> will<00:01:32.110> ensure<00:01:32.229> a

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
on the inside it will ensure a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.749 
on the inside it will ensure a
watertight<00:01:33.369> seal

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.760 

so<00:01:41.270> here's<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.630> backing<00:01:42.020> plate<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:42.469> these

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
so here's the backing plate and these

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.060 
so here's the backing plate and these
little<00:01:43.009> nuts<00:01:43.930> fit<00:01:44.930> into<00:01:45.110> these<00:01:45.320> molded<00:01:45.829> holes

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
little nuts fit into these molded holes

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.889 
little nuts fit into these molded holes
right<00:01:46.340> here<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:53.030> that's<00:01:53.329> going<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.600> go<00:01:53.719> in

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
right here and that's going to go in

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:09.260 
right here and that's going to go in
underneath

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.630 

the<00:02:10.270> last<00:02:10.509> step<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.620> process<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.400> making

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the last step in this process is making

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.520 
the last step in this process is making
sure<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.150> these<00:02:13.420> are<00:02:13.600> tight<00:02:13.870> all<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.350> way

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
sure that these are tight all the way

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.340 
sure that these are tight all the way
now<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.850> base<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.720> ramp<00:02:16.900> tube<00:02:17.200> is

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
now that the base of the ramp tube is

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.199 
now that the base of the ramp tube is
secured<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.890> boat<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.820> go<00:02:18.940> ahead<00:02:19.060> and

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
secured to the boat you can go ahead and

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.240 
secured to the boat you can go ahead and
stick<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.780> actual<00:02:20.110> rod<00:02:20.350> holder<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:20.860> there<00:02:21.070> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
stick the actual rod holder on there and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.720 
stick the actual rod holder on there and
tighten<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.209> up<00:02:22.500> when<00:02:23.500> I'm<00:02:23.650> going<00:02:24.310> through<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
tighten it up when I'm going through the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.940 
tighten it up when I'm going through the
surf<00:02:25.000> or<00:02:25.270> when<00:02:25.450> I'm<00:02:25.600> launching<00:02:26.170> my<00:02:26.380> kayak<00:02:26.740> or

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
surf or when I'm launching my kayak or

surf or when I'm launching my kayak or
anything<00:02:27.130> like<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.520> lay<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:27.910> flat<00:02:28.120> tighten

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
anything like that I lay it flat tighten

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.510 
anything like that I lay it flat tighten
that<00:02:28.810> up<00:02:28.870> beauty<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:29.890> thing<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.250> can

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
that up beauty of this thing is you can

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.630 
that up beauty of this thing is you can
rotate<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:31.120> any<00:02:31.570> which<00:02:31.780> way<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.080> like<00:02:32.640> for

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
rotate it any which way you like for

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.220 
rotate it any which way you like for
example<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.209> have<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.510> angled<00:02:34.720> out<00:02:35.020> like

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
example you can have it angled out like

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.949 
example you can have it angled out like
that<00:02:35.440> for<00:02:35.739> when<00:02:35.890> you're<00:02:36.010> fishing<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.300> because
