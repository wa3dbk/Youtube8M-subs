00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:03.770 

okay<00:00:02.429> today<00:00:02.820> I'm<00:00:02.909> doing<00:00:03.090> some<00:00:03.330> more<00:00:03.449> work<00:00:03.629> on

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
okay today I'm doing some more work on

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.740 
okay today I'm doing some more work on
my<00:00:03.899> electric<00:00:04.290> bike<00:00:05.029> and<00:00:06.029> if<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.330> look<00:00:06.480> closely

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
my electric bike and if you look closely

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.150 
my electric bike and if you look closely
you<00:00:07.020> can<00:00:07.049> see<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.379> it's<00:00:07.589> wire<00:00:07.859> she's

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
you can see that it's wire she's

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.480 
you can see that it's wire she's
completely<00:00:08.880> shredded<00:00:09.980> it<00:00:10.980> didn't<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.340> any

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
completely shredded it didn't have any

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.850 
completely shredded it didn't have any
sort<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.090> protection<00:00:12.929> against<00:00:13.410> robbing<00:00:13.740> up

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
sort of a protection against robbing up

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.240 
sort of a protection against robbing up
this<00:00:14.630> metal<00:00:15.630> piece<00:00:15.750> here<00:00:17.029> and<00:00:18.800> I<00:00:19.800> wanted<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
this metal piece here and I wanted to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.870 
this metal piece here and I wanted to
run<00:00:20.430> some<00:00:20.609> thicker<00:00:20.850> gauge<00:00:21.090> wire<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.720> anyway

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
run some thicker gauge wire to it anyway

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
run some thicker gauge wire to it anyway
so<00:00:23.880> I'll<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.150> opening<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.750> motor<00:00:24.960> pulling

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
so I'll be opening up the motor pulling

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
so I'll be opening up the motor pulling
out<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> wiring<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> hall-effect

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
out all that wiring and the hall-effect

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.269 
out all that wiring and the hall-effect
wires<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.199> replace<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.740> thicker<00:00:29.039> gauge

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
wires and replace it with thicker gauge

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.120 
wires and replace it with thicker gauge
wire<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> windings<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.130> some

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
wire going to the windings and some

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889 
wire going to the windings and some
different<00:00:32.520> hopefully<00:00:32.790> copper<00:00:33.270> wire<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
different hopefully copper wire going to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.110 
different hopefully copper wire going to
the<00:00:34.020> Hall<00:00:34.290> effect<00:00:34.410> sensors<00:00:34.969> let's<00:00:35.969> get

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the Hall effect sensors let's get

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.210 
the Hall effect sensors let's get
started

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:01:20.450 

you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.800 

if<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.549> couldn't<00:01:21.790> tell<00:01:21.939> by<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.180> inside<00:01:22.540> here

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
if you couldn't tell by the inside here

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.480 
if you couldn't tell by the inside here
I've<00:01:23.080> already<00:01:23.439> had<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.710> open<00:01:24.070> quite<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.280> few

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
I've already had this open quite a few

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.609 
I've already had this open quite a few
times<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:28.750> going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.049> get<00:01:29.140> all<00:01:29.229> this<00:01:29.409> wire

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
times so I'm going to get all this wire

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.850 
times so I'm going to get all this wire
stripped<00:01:29.950> out<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.399> while<00:01:31.030> I'm<00:01:31.149> at<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.860> I'm

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
stripped out and while I'm at it I'm

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.499 
stripped out and while I'm at it I'm
going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.189> drill<00:01:33.520> some<00:01:33.700> holes<00:01:33.759> half<00:01:34.299> inch

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
going to drill some holes half inch

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.310 
going to drill some holes half inch
holes<00:01:34.750> around<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.940> around<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.030> casing<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
holes around this around the casing it

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.770 
holes around this around the casing it
will<00:01:38.470> remove<00:01:39.280> my<00:01:39.460> waterproofing<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.210> had<00:01:40.420> but

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
will remove my waterproofing I had but

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.700 
will remove my waterproofing I had but
it<00:01:40.960> will<00:01:42.210> greatly<00:01:43.210> increase<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.899> cooling<00:01:44.530> of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
it will greatly increase the cooling of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.960 
it will greatly increase the cooling of
the<00:01:45.009> motor<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.430> make<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.640> run<00:01:45.759> more

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
the motor and make it run more

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:56.260 
the motor and make it run more
efficiently

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:27.179 

you

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.979 

so<00:02:28.189> we've<00:02:28.700> seem<00:02:28.909> to<00:02:29.060> run<00:02:29.269> into<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.599> little<00:02:29.870> bit

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
so we've seem to run into a little bit

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.330 
so we've seem to run into a little bit
of<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.109> snag<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:34.299> original<00:02:35.299> wire<00:02:36.189> let's<00:02:37.189> try

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
of a snag the original wire let's try

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.420 
of a snag the original wire let's try
this<00:02:37.420> original<00:02:38.420> sage<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.049> wire<00:02:39.349> is<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.739> it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
this original sage of wire is that it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.789 
this original sage of wire is that it
goes<00:02:40.549> in<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.819> motor<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.260> goes<00:02:42.439> into<00:02:42.620> this

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
goes in the motor and it goes into this

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.259 
goes in the motor and it goes into this
bundle<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.310> there's<00:02:43.459> hardly<00:02:43.700> enough<00:02:43.819> room

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
bundle and there's hardly enough room

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.179 
bundle and there's hardly enough room
and<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.079> mean<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.379> a<00:02:45.439> tight<00:02:45.650> squeeze<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:46.099> get

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
and I mean it's a tight squeeze to get

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.429 
and I mean it's a tight squeeze to get
that<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.519> there<00:02:46.719> we're<00:02:47.719> going<00:02:47.900> from<00:02:48.049> that<00:02:48.200> gage

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
that in there we're going from that gage

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:54.520 
that in there we're going from that gage
wire<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.500> gage<00:02:52.010> wire<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.900> think<00:02:53.989> what

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
wire to that gage wire so I think what

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.869 
wire to that gage wire so I think what
we<00:02:54.650> might<00:02:54.799> have<00:02:54.859> to<00:02:55.129> do<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:57.250> drill<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.519> shaft

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
we might have to do is drill that shaft

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.509 
we might have to do is drill that shaft
out<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.400> little<00:03:02.209> bit<00:03:02.450> more<00:03:03.519> what

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
out right there a little bit more what

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.670 
out right there a little bit more what
you<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.819> my<00:03:05.150> cost<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.870> issues<00:03:06.109> of<00:03:06.230> structural

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
you have my cost of issues of structural

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.819 
you have my cost of issues of structural
integrity<00:03:07.870> but<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.959> needs<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.169> be<00:03:09.260> done<00:03:09.470> so

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
integrity but it needs to be done so

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:35.500 
integrity but it needs to be done so
let's<00:03:10.040> see<00:03:10.250> how<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.489> goes

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.569 

you
