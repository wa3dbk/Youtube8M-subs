because it has a brush at the end for
Katie<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.680> Frog<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.400> you'd<00:00:29.640> ever<00:00:29.760> use

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this part of the Frog so that's kind of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.080 
this part of the Frog so that's kind of
easy<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> brush<00:00:34.680> any<00:00:35.090> dust

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
easy if you just want a brush any dust

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.959 
easy if you just want a brush any dust
or<00:00:36.270> dirt<00:00:36.480> off<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> hill<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.440> off<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> Frog

or dirt off the hill for off the Frog

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.250 
or dirt off the hill for off the Frog
then<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.540> standard<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> lot

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
then this is just a standard what a lot

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
then this is just a standard what a lot
of<00:00:40.290> people<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.340> ugly<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
of people will have this one ugly but

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
of people will have this one ugly but
they're<00:00:42.840> both<00:00:42.989> okay<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.309> be

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
they're both okay but this one would be

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:55.520 
they're both okay but this one would be
more<00:00:44.610> recommended<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> take<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.199> we've<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
more recommended to take now we've got a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.849 
more recommended to take now we've got a
coat<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> plastic<00:00:58.109> main<00:00:58.320> comb<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
coat I this is a plastic main comb and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.520 
coat I this is a plastic main comb and
this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> tail<00:00:59.730> comb<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.289> usually<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.320> use

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
this is a tail comb I usually just use

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.280 
this is a tail comb I usually just use
this<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.219> both<00:01:02.550> made<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> tail<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this for both made a tail because it's a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.350 
this for both made a tail because it's a
lot<00:01:04.439> easier<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.369> better<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.240> you're

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
lot easier but it's better for if you're

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
lot easier but it's better for if you're
pulling<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.810> horse's<00:01:06.990> mane<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.100> don't

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
pulling out your horse's mane you don't

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.830 
pulling out your horse's mane you don't
want<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> plastic<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
want to use a plastic one because the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
want to use a plastic one because the
bristles<00:01:10.229> break<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.130> easily<00:01:11.310> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
bristles break really really easily so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
bristles break really really easily so
this<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.570> would<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.260> recommended<00:01:13.740> wood

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this one would be the recommended wood

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
this one would be the recommended wood
and<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.610> could<00:01:14.790> use<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> form<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> ton<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> health

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and you could use a form a ton to health

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
and you could use a form a ton to health
make<00:01:16.380> sure<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:16.890> push<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.580> tail<00:01:17.820> out

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
make sure you don't push your tail out

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.160 
make sure you don't push your tail out
you're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> stand<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:18.960> too<00:01:19.140> much

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you're going to stand out too much

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
you're going to stand out too much
because<00:01:20.030> your<00:01:21.030> horse<00:01:21.240> will<00:01:21.360> end<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.600> having<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because your horse will end up having a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.300 
because your horse will end up having a
very<00:01:22.080> thin<00:01:22.320> tail<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.950> takes<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
very thin tail because it takes out a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:34.510 
very thin tail because it takes out a
lot<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> hair<00:01:28.850> next<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.360> washing<00:01:30.659> supplies

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.800 

so<00:01:35.509> usually<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:35.990> would<00:01:36.140> just<00:01:36.740> use<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.920> house<00:01:37.189> for

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
so usually I would just use a house for

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.630 
so usually I would just use a house for
washing<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.079> if<00:01:39.259> I<00:01:39.439> didn't<00:01:39.979> have<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.159> Howser<00:01:40.399> if

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
washing but if I didn't have a Howser if

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.090 
washing but if I didn't have a Howser if
I<00:01:40.700> wanted<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.179> wash<00:01:41.329> my<00:01:42.140> horse<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.619> properly

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
I wanted to wash my horse of properly

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200 
I wanted to wash my horse of properly
using<00:01:43.610> shampoo<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.329> would<00:01:45.110> use<00:01:45.289> this<00:01:45.500> sponge

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
using shampoo I would use this sponge

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.490 
using shampoo I would use this sponge
although<00:01:47.210> we've<00:01:47.390> got<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.569> sweat<00:01:47.810> scraper<00:01:48.259> so

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
although we've got a sweat scraper so

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.440 
although we've got a sweat scraper so
whenever<00:01:49.310> after<00:01:49.429> you've<00:01:49.729> washed<00:01:49.909> your<00:01:50.060> parody

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
whenever after you've washed your parody

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.889 
whenever after you've washed your parody
that<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.229> very<00:01:51.590> wet<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.490> just<00:01:52.729> swear<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.630> swipe
