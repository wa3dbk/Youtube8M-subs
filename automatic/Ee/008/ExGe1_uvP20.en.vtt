manual brightness slider which is okay

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.700 
manual brightness slider which is okay
but<00:00:18.570> then<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.050> annoying<00:00:19.320> when<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.590> go

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
but then it can be annoying when you go

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.290 
but then it can be annoying when you go
into<00:00:19.920> different<00:00:20.070> light<00:00:20.490> environments<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
is probably the most important thing of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
is probably the most important thing of
the<00:00:49.260> whole<00:00:49.289> app<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.730> I've<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:51.059> mine

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the whole app you can see I've got mine

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.569 
the whole app you can see I've got mine
to<00:00:51.570> adjust<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.350> Wake<00:00:52.620> only<00:00:53.160> now<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to adjust on Wake only now what that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
to adjust on Wake only now what that
means<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> turn<00:00:54.690> off<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> display<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
means is when I turn off the display and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979 
means is when I turn off the display and
turn<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> back<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> turn<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> back<00:00:57.780> on

turn it back on when I turn it back on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.580 
turn it back on when I turn it back on
basically<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:59.329> quickly<00:01:00.329> Lux<00:01:00.750> uses<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
basically it some quickly Lux uses the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.850 
basically it some quickly Lux uses the
sensor<00:01:02.399> over<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> light<00:01:03.840> sensor<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
sensor over here on the light sensor to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
sensor over here on the light sensor to
adjust<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.880> display<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.020> environment

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
adjust my display to the environment

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
adjust my display to the environment
that<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.490> that's<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:09.960> done

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that I'm in and that's it it's then done

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.570 
that I'm in and that's it it's then done
for<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> rest<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
for the rest of the time you have to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.830 
for the rest of the time you have to
turn<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.119> tell<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> confer<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
turn it off and tell it that confer to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140 
turn it off and tell it that confer to
readjust<00:01:13.280> now<00:01:14.280> obviously<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.119> use

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
readjust now obviously you can use

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.539 
readjust now obviously you can use
different<00:01:15.509> modes<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> use<00:01:16.320> dynamic

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
different modes you can use dynamic

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.969 
different modes you can use dynamic
periodic<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> ascending<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.770> do

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
periodic and ascending which will all do

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.649 
periodic and ascending which will all do
different<00:01:20.400> things<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.090> quickly<00:01:21.360> go

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
different things and if I quickly go

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.429 
different things and if I quickly go

significant<00:01:33.600> change<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> an<00:01:34.229> ambient

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
significant change in an ambient

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
significant change in an ambient
brightness<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.130> detected<00:01:35.670> ascending<00:01:36.630> will

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
brightness is detected ascending will

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.300 
brightness is detected ascending will
adjust<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.470> flight<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:37.890> brightness

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
adjust the back flight when brightness

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.480 
adjust the back flight when brightness
of<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.579> environment<00:01:38.820> increases<00:01:39.479> only<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
of your environment increases only and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
of your environment increases only and
periodic<00:01:41.490> basically<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.509> manual

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
periodic basically you can set manual

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.100 
periodic basically you can set manual
times<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.950> when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.700> want<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
times for when you want it to up the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.389 
times for when you want it to up the
brightness<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.590> down<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> brightness<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.340> if

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
brightness or down the brightness so if

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.770 
brightness or down the brightness so if
you<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.640> you're<00:01:47.820> outside<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you know you're outside you can actually

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.260 
you know you're outside you can actually
do<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.770> these<00:01:50.369> two<00:01:50.729> settings<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.210> here

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
do that now these two settings up here

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.370 
do that now these two settings up here
will<00:01:51.479> probably<00:01:51.630> take<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.140> bit<00:01:52.290> more

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
will probably take a little bit more

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.380 
will probably take a little bit more
battery<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.070> why<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.820> wake<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
battery that's why I use on wake and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.109 
battery that's why I use on wake and
I've<00:01:54.509> been<00:01:54.659> pretty<00:01:54.930> damn<00:01:55.110> happy<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.829> week

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
I've been pretty damn happy with on week

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.219 
I've been pretty damn happy with on week
so<00:01:57.119> yeah<00:01:57.950> let's<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.490> back<00:01:59.729> into<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.229> settings

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
so yeah let's go back into the settings

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
so yeah let's go back into the settings
here<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.619> check<00:02:01.860> some<00:02:02.009> other<00:02:02.189> stuff<00:02:02.490> out<00:02:02.670> now

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
here and check some other stuff out now

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
here and check some other stuff out now
there's<00:02:03.869> two<00:02:04.079> ways<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
there's two ways it can actually get the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.419 
there's two ways it can actually get the
light<00:02:06.170> from<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.380> surroundings<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> can<00:02:08.250> use

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
light from your surroundings you can use

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
light from your surroundings you can use
the<00:02:08.610> light<00:02:09.000> sensor<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:09.599> which<00:02:09.780> most<00:02:10.020> phones

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the light sensor here which most phones

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.809 
the light sensor here which most phones
have<00:02:10.379> if<00:02:10.770> yours<00:02:11.009> doesn't<00:02:11.310> work<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.640> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
have if yours doesn't work you can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.230 
have if yours doesn't work you can
actually

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
actually

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.630 
actually
use<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.020> camera<00:02:13.710> sensor<00:02:14.130> which<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.460> haven't

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
use the camera sensor which I haven't

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.270 
use the camera sensor which I haven't
tried<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.230> make<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.590> use<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> camera

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
tried but you can make it use the camera

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.470 
tried but you can make it use the camera
sense<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.580> don't<00:02:17.790> know<00:02:17.880> how<00:02:18.000> well<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.360> will<00:02:18.420> work

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
sense I don't know how well it will work

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.500 
sense I don't know how well it will work
probably<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.350> well<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:20.250> yeah<00:02:20.520> most<00:02:20.820> new

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
probably not as well but yeah most new

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
probably not as well but yeah most new
phones<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.440> alive<00:02:22.800> sensor<00:02:23.190> anyway

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
phones do have the alive sensor anyway

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.090 
phones do have the alive sensor anyway
now<00:02:24.270> what's<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.140> cool<00:02:25.410> about<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.920> if

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
now what's really cool about this is if

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.990 
now what's really cool about this is if
you<00:02:26.130> can<00:02:26.310> see<00:02:26.460> here<00:02:26.640> I've<00:02:26.700> got<00:02:26.730> this

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you can see here I've got this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
you can see here I've got this
persistent<00:02:27.540> widget<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.870> don't<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.380> have

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
persistent widget you don't have to have

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.560 
persistent widget you don't have to have
this<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:28.980> Android<00:02:29.310> 4.1<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.150> see<00:02:30.390> you

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
this but in Android 4.1 you can see you

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.260 
this but in Android 4.1 you can see you
get<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.020> expand<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.620> close<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.910> actually

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
get to expand and close it it's actually

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.960 
get to expand and close it it's actually
chosen<00:02:33.540> my<00:02:33.810> back<00:02:33.990> right<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.410> moment<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.830> be

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
chosen my back right at the moment to be

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.360 
chosen my back right at the moment to be
52%<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.150> my<00:02:36.360> current<00:02:36.750> light<00:02:36.930> environment<00:02:37.560> so

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
52% in my current light environment so

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.620 
52% in my current light environment so
you<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.580> pull<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.910> down<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.510> can

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630

you can pull this down here you can
actually<00:02:39.780> switch<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.350> manual<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.920> you

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
actually switch it to manual if you

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.760 
actually switch it to manual if you
think<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:41.370> rubbish<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.150> change<00:02:42.450> it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
think it's rubbish and you can change it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.170 
think it's rubbish and you can change it
42:30<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.920> high<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.610> want<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.940> switch<00:02:45.150> it

42:30 to high if you want to switch it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.060 
42:30 to high if you want to switch it
back<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> auto<00:02:45.750> hit<00:02:46.200> refresh<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.650> it'll<00:02:46.920> go

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
back to auto hit refresh and it'll go

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.790 
back to auto hit refresh and it'll go
back<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.280> where<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> thinks<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.180> right<00:02:49.050> now

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
back to where it thinks it's right now

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.830 
back to where it thinks it's right now
another<00:02:50.520> cool<00:02:50.790> feature<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:51.240> this<00:02:51.330> app<00:02:51.540> is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
here you can actually go below a zero

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.430 
here you can actually go below a zero
which<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.150> help<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.450> save<00:02:57.690> some<00:02:57.720> battery<00:02:58.290> so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
which can help you save some battery so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.560 
which can help you save some battery so
you<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.770> here<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.220> 15<00:02:59.610> 20<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.240> then

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
you can see here on one 15 20 and then

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.420 
you can see here on one 15 20 and then
it<00:03:00.690> hits<00:03:00.840> -<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.680> now<00:03:01.740> we<00:03:01.800> go<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.130> can<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it hits - and now we go you can see the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.070 
it hits - and now we go you can see the
screen<00:03:02.880> brightness<00:03:03.180> pretty<00:03:03.540> much<00:03:03.690> gets<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
screen brightness pretty much gets to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.740 
screen brightness pretty much gets to
zero<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.400> get<00:03:05.760> lower<00:03:06.030> brightness<00:03:06.360> than

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
zero so you get lower brightness than

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.990 
zero so you get lower brightness than
you<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.140> officially<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.160> Google's

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
you can officially with Google's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.240 
you can officially with Google's
automatic<00:03:09.540> brightness<00:03:09.690> now<00:03:10.080> why<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:10.920> is

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
automatic brightness now why this is

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.120 
automatic brightness now why this is
useful<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:12.680> interesting<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.800> I'll<00:03:13.860> show<00:03:14.070> you

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
useful is interesting and I'll show you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.730 
useful is interesting and I'll show you
why<00:03:14.430> if<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.060> go<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.240> my<00:03:15.450> modified<00:03:15.900> link<00:03:16.200> samples

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
why if I go to my modified link samples

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.430 
why if I go to my modified link samples
you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.220> basically<00:03:17.400> change<00:03:17.940> what<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.570> does<00:03:18.780> so

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
you can basically change what it does so

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440 
you can basically change what it does so
yesterday<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.160> was<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.520> my<00:03:20.640> bedroom<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.270> know

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
yesterday I was in my bedroom you know

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.110 
yesterday I was in my bedroom you know
and<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.780> was<00:03:21.900> using<00:03:22.050> my<00:03:22.230> phone<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:23.670> didn't

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and I was using my phone and I didn't

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.430 
and I was using my phone and I didn't
have<00:03:24.210> any<00:03:24.330> lights<00:03:24.600> on<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.960> such<00:03:25.080> wanted<00:03:25.350> to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
have any lights on of such wanted to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.670 
have any lights on of such wanted to
test<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.930> basically<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.260> didn't<00:03:28.560> pick

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
test this and basically it didn't pick

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.110 
test this and basically it didn't pick
up<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.860> light<00:03:29.070> reading<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.030> know

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
up a light reading because you know

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.840 
up a light reading because you know
there<00:03:30.510> was<00:03:30.630> no<00:03:30.750> light<00:03:30.960> in<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.170> room<00:03:31.490> so<00:03:32.490> when

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
there was no light in the room so when

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.890 
there was no light in the room so when
there<00:03:33.000> was<00:03:33.090> no<00:03:33.240> light<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.660> room<00:03:33.840> I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
there was no light in the room I

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780 
there was no light in the room I
actually<00:03:34.080> changed<00:03:34.620> my<00:03:34.680> lowest<00:03:35.220> brightness<00:03:35.430> to

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
actually changed my lowest brightness to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.180 
actually changed my lowest brightness to
minus<00:03:36.120> 10<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.900> when<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.200> gets<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.440> reading<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.890> 0

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
minus 10 so when it gets a reading of 0

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.560 
minus 10 so when it gets a reading of 0
which<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:38.520> when<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:38.940> pretty<00:03:39.210> much<00:03:39.330> low

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
which is when it's pretty much low

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.260 
which is when it's pretty much low
brightness<00:03:39.810> no<00:03:40.350> lights<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.250> my<00:03:41.280> room<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
brightness no lights in my room the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.270 
brightness no lights in my room the
brightness<00:03:42.660> will<00:03:42.810> go<00:03:42.900> down<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.260> minus<00:03:43.680> 10<00:03:44.010> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
brightness will go down to minus 10 so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.470 
brightness will go down to minus 10 so
you<00:03:44.340> are<00:03:44.550> actually<00:03:44.670> going<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.000> save<00:03:45.210> more

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
you are actually going to save more

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.450 
you are actually going to save more
battery<00:03:45.990> than<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.500> would<00:03:46.740> normally<00:03:47.010> if<00:03:47.340> it

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
battery than you would normally if it

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.700 
battery than you would normally if it
was<00:03:47.610> at<00:03:47.730> 0<00:03:48.000> now<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:48.870> change<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.410> like

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
was at 0 now you can change that to like

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.790 
was at 0 now you can change that to like
minus<00:03:50.100> 20<00:03:50.400> minus<00:03:50.550> 30<00:03:50.880> minus<00:03:50.970> 40<00:03:51.320> no<00:03:52.320> problem

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
minus 20 minus 30 minus 40 no problem

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.550 
minus 20 minus 30 minus 40 no problem
but<00:03:53.070> then<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.670> know<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.030> liked<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.050> at<00:03:55.110> minus<00:03:55.380> 10

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
but then you know I liked it at minus 10

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.020 
but then you know I liked it at minus 10
because<00:03:55.770> I<00:03:55.830> want<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.100> see<00:03:56.250> my<00:03:56.430> display<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.820> some

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
because I want to see my display in some

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.390 
because I want to see my display in some
of<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.210> colors<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.630> stuff<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.960> that<00:03:58.400> so

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
of the colors and stuff like that so

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.010 
of the colors and stuff like that so
that's<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.150> cool<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.690> can<00:04:00.840> keep

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
that's really cool and you can keep

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.810 
that's really cool and you can keep
adding<00:04:01.260> value<00:04:01.710> to<00:04:01.740> guys<00:04:02.070> so<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.490> want<00:04:02.730> to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
adding value to guys so if you want to

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.030 
adding value to guys so if you want to
say<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.540> get<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:04.170> know<00:04:04.320> maybe<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.620> reading

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
say if you get to know maybe a reading

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.890 
say if you get to know maybe a reading
of<00:04:05.160> 40<00:04:05.550> lakhs<00:04:05.760> new<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.150> want<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.390> be<00:04:06.540> 40

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
of 40 lakhs new and you want it to be 40

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.870 
of 40 lakhs new and you want it to be 40
percent<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.380> can<00:04:07.560> add<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.580> can<00:04:08.760> do

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
percent you can add that and you can do

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.760 
percent you can add that and you can do
that<00:04:09.030> really<00:04:09.390> easy<00:04:09.540> if<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.840> click<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.290> if<00:04:10.560> I

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
that really easy if I click this if I

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.190 
that really easy if I click this if I
want<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.400> example<00:04:11.640> now<00:04:12.209> when<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:12.959> gets<00:04:13.110> a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
want this for example now when it gets a

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.310 
want this for example now when it gets a
reading<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.590> 47<00:04:14.220> here<00:04:14.490> if<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.570> want<00:04:15.810> that's<00:04:15.990> not

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
reading of 47 here if I want that's not

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.310 
reading of 47 here if I want that's not
be<00:04:16.470> 49<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.010> can<00:04:17.520> pull<00:04:17.820> this<00:04:18.030> down<00:04:18.330> here<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:19.080> say

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
be 49 I can pull this down here to say

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.830 
be 49 I can pull this down here to say
maybe<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.950> don't<00:04:20.070> know<00:04:20.250> 27%<00:04:21.150> hold<00:04:21.419> down<00:04:21.660> the

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
maybe I don't know 27% hold down the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.610 
maybe I don't know 27% hold down the
link<00:04:22.020> button<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.340> see<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.610> says<00:04:23.790> linked

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
link button you can see it says linked

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.280 
link button you can see it says linked
now<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.460> will<00:04:25.610> choose<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.480> brightness<00:04:26.960> level

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
now it will choose that brightness level

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.260 
now it will choose that brightness level
when<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:27.650> gets<00:04:27.889> that<00:04:28.220> reading<00:04:28.699> so<00:04:28.910> if<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.090> go<00:04:29.210> to

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
when it gets that reading so if I go to

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.700 
when it gets that reading so if I go to
my<00:04:29.449> modified<00:04:29.810> links<00:04:30.139> you<00:04:30.230> can<00:04:30.320> see<00:04:30.470> when<00:04:30.620> it

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
my modified links you can see when it

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.240 
my modified links you can see when it
hits<00:04:30.889> 47<00:04:31.550> it's<00:04:31.760> going<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.090> get<00:04:32.260> 27%<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.470> I

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
hits 47 it's going to get 27% and I

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.480 
hits 47 it's going to get 27% and I
lower<00:04:34.490> my<00:04:34.760> brightness<00:04:35.030> level<00:04:35.680> now<00:04:36.680> I<00:04:37.040> actually

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
lower my brightness level now I actually

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.210 
lower my brightness level now I actually
don't<00:04:38.360> want<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.810> because<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.199> like<00:04:39.530> how<00:04:40.070> it

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
don't want that because I like how it
