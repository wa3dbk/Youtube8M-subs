 our android this is really very 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.120
 simple, we just have to go 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.890
 in our browser it can be from the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 cellular can be from our 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.280
 computer 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.930
 and you can show us this page 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.960
 here we will not get several maps and then 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.480
 you are your decision the axis that map 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.480
 they want to download for their minecraft 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.720
 something good this page is that there is in 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.140
 some maps I do not know why only 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.400
 downloaded but there are maps that says that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.380
 you can download it in survival mode 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.380
 or survival or you can also 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.690
 download it in creative mode create your 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.180
 map and well then there are some good 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.580
 after they have chosen their map 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.590
 who want to download 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.560
 and they simply give it in the image 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.810
 if it will react to another page 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.540
 as you will see here they will appear more 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.200
 images on that map and we will get the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.510
 download link we just give you 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.760
 click 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.760
 and we give to download 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.569
 once it has been downloaded 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.179
 we do not go to the folder where the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.789
 file if you are in a 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.380
 computer like me because it simply 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.960
 they go to the downloads folder and they give 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.849
 extract here and then if they are in a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.299
 mobile device we do not go with a one 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.670
 program to see files as it is file 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.660
 explorer that I will give you the link in the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.340
 description of the video so that 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.239
 install on your android right now 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.760
 what we are going to need is simply a 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.840
 once we extract and we will have one 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.810
 folder like this we give you cut 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.129
 and we go in my case like this in a 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.060
 so we go to our device 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:38.690
 which is connected and we copy it and if 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.930
 can you want at the root of the the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.629
 device or in some folder like the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.030
 download I recommend it but I'll paste it 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.600
 here in the root 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.820
 we will copy the file 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.090
 and now it's time to move on to our 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.440
 device 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.830
 so let's go to the device good one 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.060
 Once we are on our device 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.760
 we just have to have installed 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.069
 the program is file explorer, we are going to 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.510
 open 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:16.590
 and we are going to look for the file that 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.590
 we have where we left it 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.590
 installed 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.860
 in the video before it had left the 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.560
 cell's network but I left it now 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.780
 in download forgive there for that but 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.240
 we just have to copy to 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.560
 archive 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.940
 and we go to the game folder 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.300
 that is there with a greater point 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.370
 minecraft words and we hit 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:52.220
 that's just all there is to it 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:55.870
 do then we go to the menu again 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.580
 and then we open minecraft 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.090
 and I remind you that the description of 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.030
