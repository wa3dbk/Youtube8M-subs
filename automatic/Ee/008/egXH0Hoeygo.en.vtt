00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and I never did so no I Here I am over a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.420 
and I never did so no I Here I am over a
year<00:00:28.710> later<00:00:28.949> finally<00:00:29.939> talking<00:00:30.210> about<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.750> um

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
year later finally talking about it um

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.350 
year later finally talking about it um
first<00:00:32.430> thought<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> wanted<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> talk

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
first thought what I wanted to talk

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.410 
first thought what I wanted to talk
about<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.370> why<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.880> important<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
about was you know why it's important to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
about was you know why it's important to
drink<00:00:36.630> enough<00:00:36.930> water<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.620> also<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.160> danger

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
drink enough water but also the danger

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.139 
drink enough water but also the danger
of<00:00:38.610> drinking<00:00:39.030> too<00:00:39.329> much<00:00:39.570> liquids<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.920> well<00:00:41.309> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
of drinking too much liquids as well so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
of drinking too much liquids as well so
because<00:00:42.629> um<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.500> been<00:00:43.710> guilty<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because um I have been guilty of this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.990 
because um I have been guilty of this
myself

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
myself

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.319 
myself
of<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.780> drinking<00:00:46.140> too<00:00:46.530> much<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.120> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
of actually drinking too much and that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
of actually drinking too much and that
can<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.690> dangerous<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> itself<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
can be dangerous in itself and so a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.110 
can be dangerous in itself and so a
couple<00:00:51.239> interesting<00:00:51.719> facts<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.289> found

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
couple interesting facts that I found

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
couple interesting facts that I found
was<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.480> says<00:00:54.649> 75%<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> Americans<00:00:56.340> are

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
was that it says 75% of Americans are

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
was that it says 75% of Americans are
chronically<00:00:56.910> dehydrated<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.530> 37<00:00:59.280> percent

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
chronically dehydrated and in 37 percent

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.060 
chronically dehydrated and in 37 percent
of<00:00:59.789> Americans<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.570> thirst<00:01:00.870> mechanism<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
of Americans the thirst mechanism is so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.390 
of Americans the thirst mechanism is so
weak<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:03.059> since<00:01:03.270> taken<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.930> hunger<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
weak that it since taken for hunger and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
weak that it since taken for hunger and
I<00:01:05.489> thought<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.060> kind<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> interesting

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I thought that was kind of interesting

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.390 
I thought that was kind of interesting
because<00:01:09.080> drinking<00:01:10.080> enough<00:01:10.530> liquids<00:01:10.950> while<00:01:11.159> on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
because drinking enough liquids while on

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.469 
because drinking enough liquids while on
HCG<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.150> definitely<00:01:12.750> an<00:01:12.960> important<00:01:13.470> factor<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
HCG is definitely an important factor in

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.630 
HCG is definitely an important factor in
you<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:16.080> eating<00:01:16.409> too<00:01:16.619> much<00:01:16.860> since<00:01:17.490> we're

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you know not eating too much since we're

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
you know not eating too much since we're
eating<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.900> thought<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.619> was

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
eating so little I thought it was

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560 
eating so little I thought it was
interesting<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.340> sometimes<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.450> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
interesting that sometimes when you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.390 
interesting that sometimes when you
think<00:01:21.780> you're<00:01:21.990> hungry<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> protocol<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
think you're hungry on the protocol it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
think you're hungry on the protocol it
could<00:01:24.000> very<00:01:24.240> well<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:24.990> not

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
could very well be that you're not

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.679 
could very well be that you're not
hungry<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:25.890> thirsty<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.119> definitely

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
hungry but you're thirsty so definitely

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.010 
hungry but you're thirsty so definitely
try<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.530> first<00:01:28.799> line<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> defense

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
try that as your first line of defense

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.600 
try that as your first line of defense
drink<00:01:31.020> enough<00:01:31.290> liquids<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
drink enough liquids and see if that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.039 
drink enough liquids and see if that
makes<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.299> feel<00:01:33.600> better<00:01:33.840> as

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
makes you you know feel better as

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
makes you you know feel better as
regards<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.740> hunger<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.090> thought

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
regards to your hunger so I just thought

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.160 
regards to your hunger so I just thought
that<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.540> interesting<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:38.780> another<00:01:39.780> thing

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that was interesting and another thing

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.030 
that was interesting and another thing
is<00:01:40.920> speaking<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.540> kidneys<00:01:43.040> because

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
is speaking about the kidneys because

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.210 
is speaking about the kidneys because
you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.460> kidneys<00:01:44.790> process<00:01:45.390> um<00:01:46.220> water

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you know your kidneys process um water

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.460 
you know your kidneys process um water
right<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.329> interesting<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> read<00:01:49.320> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
right so it's interesting what I read is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.370 
right so it's interesting what I read is
that<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:50.729> says<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.180> kidneys<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:52.049> process

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that it says your kidneys can process

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.480 
that it says your kidneys can process
about<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.700> quarter<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.479> gallon<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.020> water<00:01:55.079> um

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
about a quarter of a gallon of water um

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.920 
about a quarter of a gallon of water um
per<00:01:57.299> hour<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.560> healthy<00:01:58.950> kidney<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.520> rest<00:01:59.930> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
per hour in a healthy kidney at rest so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.030 
per hour in a healthy kidney at rest so
um<00:02:01.490> part<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.000> keeping<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.530> drinking

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
um part of the keeping you know drinking

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.969 
um part of the keeping you know drinking
liquids<00:02:05.460> safe<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.180> basically<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.259> drink<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
liquids safe is basically not to drink a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.219 
liquids safe is basically not to drink a
huge<00:02:08.489> amount<00:02:08.879> of

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
huge amount of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.339 
huge amount of
in<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.739> short<00:02:10.099> period<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.520> time<00:02:10.599> um<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:12.290> you

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
in a short period of time um so you

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.229 
in a short period of time um so you
wouldn't<00:02:12.709> want<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.860> like<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.160> down<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.519> gallon

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
wouldn't want to like just down a gallon

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.040 
wouldn't want to like just down a gallon
of<00:02:14.330> water<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:15.440> know<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.800> one<00:02:16.069> hour<00:02:16.250> um<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
of water you know in one hour um so it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.050 
of water you know in one hour um so it
says<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.410> healthy<00:02:18.560> kidney<00:02:19.129> will<00:02:19.310> process<00:02:19.550> about

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
says a healthy kidney will process about

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.699 
says a healthy kidney will process about
a<00:02:20.120> quarter<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.780> gallon<00:02:21.340> per<00:02:22.340> hour<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.959> so

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
a quarter of a gallon per hour so so

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.890 
a quarter of a gallon per hour so so
that<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.099> gives<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.730> know<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.880> good<00:02:26.330> idea

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
that just gives you you know a good idea

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.140 
that just gives you you know a good idea
in<00:02:27.110> your<00:02:27.230> head<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:27.890> would<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.580> healthy<00:02:29.000> to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
in your head of what would be healthy to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.000 
in your head of what would be healthy to
drink<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.660> given<00:02:29.959> timeframe<00:02:30.200> II<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.800> don't

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
drink in a given timeframe II I don't

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.920 
drink in a given timeframe II I don't
think<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.280> need<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.459> overthink<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.599> think

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
think you need to overthink this I think

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.050 
think you need to overthink this I think
in<00:02:33.230> general<00:02:33.410> nobody<00:02:33.980> really<00:02:34.280> drinks<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.730> gallon

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
in general nobody really drinks a gallon

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.330 
in general nobody really drinks a gallon
of<00:02:35.120> water<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.510> an<00:02:35.599> hour<00:02:35.750> but<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.380> do<00:02:36.650> bring<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.190> up

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
of water in an hour but I do bring it up

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.390 
of water in an hour but I do bring it up
because<00:02:37.880> um<00:02:38.620> HCG<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.650> don't<00:02:39.950> think<00:02:40.129> this<00:02:40.250> is

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
because um HCG I don't think this is

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.089 
because um HCG I don't think this is
really<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.670> problem<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.630> on<00:02:41.780> HCG<00:02:42.349> I<00:02:42.650> do<00:02:42.709> think

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
really a problem but on HCG I do think

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.610 
really a problem but on HCG I do think
it<00:02:43.220> could<00:02:43.519> be<00:02:43.700> at<00:02:43.970> least<00:02:44.720> for<00:02:44.959> myself<00:02:45.410> I've

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
it could be at least for myself I've

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.110 
it could be at least for myself I've
noticed<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.099> because<00:02:46.250> we<00:02:46.549> hear<00:02:46.819> it<00:02:46.910> all<00:02:47.090> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
noticed that because we hear it all the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.630 
noticed that because we hear it all the
time<00:02:47.269> when<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.349> listen<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.799> blogs<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.459> read

time when you listen to blogs and read

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160 
time when you listen to blogs and read

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and tons of water on HCG I hear that all

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.150 
and tons of water on HCG I hear that all
the<00:02:56.390> time<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.410> then<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.680> feel<00:02:57.799> like<00:02:57.890> oh<00:02:57.980> my

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
unless I drink tons of water so then

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.940 
unless I drink tons of water so then
you're<00:03:02.329> like<00:03:02.360> downing<00:03:02.989> tons<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.500> tons<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.799> it

you're like downing tons and tons of it
and<00:03:04.099> like<00:03:04.220> getting<00:03:04.400> really<00:03:04.700> full<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:04.970> um<00:03:05.450> and

that that and that doing it like that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
that that and that doing it like that
could<00:03:08.930> could<00:03:09.230> be<00:03:09.260> um<00:03:09.620> actually<00:03:10.340> getting

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
could could be um actually getting

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.759 
could could be um actually getting
life-threatening<00:03:11.319> some<00:03:12.319> of<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.470> things<00:03:12.650> I

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
life-threatening some of the things I

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.710 
life-threatening some of the things I
was<00:03:12.860> reading<00:03:13.130> online<00:03:13.280> one<00:03:14.269> thing<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.569> can

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
was reading online one thing that can

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.509 
was reading online one thing that can
happen<00:03:14.840> when<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.200> drink<00:03:15.470> way<00:03:15.739> too<00:03:15.769> much<00:03:16.100> water

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
happen when you drink way too much water

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.479 
happen when you drink way too much water
all<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.090> once<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:18.290> basically<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.010> dilutes<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
all at once is basically it dilutes the

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.819 
all at once is basically it dilutes the
electrolytes<00:03:20.209> in<00:03:20.480> your<00:03:20.510> system<00:03:21.049> too<00:03:21.290> much<00:03:21.500> it

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
electrolytes in your system too much it

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.009 
electrolytes in your system too much it
throws<00:03:22.069> off<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.310> electrolytes<00:03:23.090> and

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
throws off the electrolytes and

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.140 
throws off the electrolytes and
basically<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.010> get<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> condition<00:03:25.940> called

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
basically you can get a condition called

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.720 
basically you can get a condition called
hypo<00:03:26.630> hyponatremia<00:03:27.620> where<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.549> basically

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
hypo hyponatremia where you basically

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.870 
hypo hyponatremia where you basically
have<00:03:29.150> insufficient<00:03:29.930> salt<00:03:30.319> in<00:03:30.590> your<00:03:30.620> blood

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
have insufficient salt in your blood

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.910 
have insufficient salt in your blood
honestly<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:32.930> probably<00:03:33.590> isn't<00:03:33.829> gonna

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
honestly this probably isn't gonna

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
honestly this probably isn't gonna
happen<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.459> anyone

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
happen to anyone

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.699 
happen to anyone
mostly<00:03:35.450> this<00:03:35.630> would<00:03:35.840> happen<00:03:36.170> we're<00:03:36.350> like<00:03:36.560> with

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
mostly this would happen we're like with

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.039 
mostly this would happen we're like with
athletes<00:03:37.280> who've<00:03:37.579> just<00:03:37.910> done<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.900> know<00:03:39.019> a

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
athletes who've just done you know a

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.770 
athletes who've just done you know a
huge<00:03:39.470> amount<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:39.889> exercising<00:03:40.819> and<00:03:41.090> they<00:03:41.510> lost

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
huge amount of exercising and they lost

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.360 
huge amount of exercising and they lost
a<00:03:42.019> bunch<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.290> lecture<00:03:42.620> lights<00:03:42.829> through<00:03:43.220> their

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
a bunch of lecture lights through their

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.640 
a bunch of lecture lights through their
sweating<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.000> then<00:03:44.239> we're<00:03:45.049> drinking<00:03:45.470> only

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
sweating and then we're drinking only

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.259 
sweating and then we're drinking only
water<00:03:45.829> and<00:03:46.430> not<00:03:46.549> replacing<00:03:46.970> those

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
water and not replacing those

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.960 
water and not replacing those
electrolytes<00:03:47.750> um<00:03:48.139> but<00:03:49.130> it's<00:03:49.280> still<00:03:49.459> just<00:03:49.519> good

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
electrolytes um but it's still just good

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.140 
electrolytes um but it's still just good
to<00:03:50.120> keep<00:03:50.269> in<00:03:50.480> mind<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.950> not<00:03:52.099> drink<00:03:52.730> too

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
to keep in mind just to not drink too

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.110 
to keep in mind just to not drink too
much<00:03:53.420> too<00:03:53.780> quickly<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:55.549> I<00:03:55.579> thought<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:55.970> was

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
much too quickly so I thought that was

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.400 
much too quickly so I thought that was
interesting<00:03:57.370> now<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.430> other<00:03:58.700> thing<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.410> how

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
interesting now the other thing is how

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.699 
interesting now the other thing is how
do<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.560> know<00:04:00.650> how<00:04:00.829> much<00:04:01.069> water<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.549> drink<00:04:01.940> and

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
do you know how much water to drink and

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.690 
do you know how much water to drink and
you<00:04:03.709> know<00:04:03.829> you're<00:04:03.920> wondering<00:04:04.099> too<00:04:04.340> much<00:04:04.489> you

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
you know you're wondering too much you

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.949 
you know you're wondering too much you
don't<00:04:04.849> learn<00:04:04.940> drink<00:04:05.180> too<00:04:05.299> little<00:04:05.510> it's<00:04:05.810> like

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
don't learn drink too little it's like

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.750 
don't learn drink too little it's like
how<00:04:06.290> do<00:04:06.349> I<00:04:06.500> know<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.340> it's<00:04:07.489> gonna<00:04:07.669> vary

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
how do I know and it's gonna vary

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.849 
how do I know and it's gonna vary
obviously<00:04:08.569> because<00:04:08.870> people<00:04:09.260> weigh<00:04:09.440> different

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
obviously because people weigh different

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.500 
obviously because people weigh different
amounts<00:04:09.889> they're<00:04:10.370> different<00:04:10.609> heights<00:04:10.940> you

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
amounts they're different heights you

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.720 
amounts they're different heights you
know<00:04:11.599> our<00:04:11.750> bodies<00:04:12.019> are<00:04:12.169> different<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.459> few

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
know our bodies are different but a few

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.509 
know our bodies are different but a few

for a week two

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320 
for a week two
your<00:04:22.590> hydration<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.430> obviously<00:04:24.150> would<00:04:24.300> be

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
your hydration this obviously would be

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.140 
your hydration this obviously would be
when<00:04:24.630> you're<00:04:24.750> off<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.170> HCG<00:04:25.730> but<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.820> says<00:04:26.970> your

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
when you're off of HCG but it says your

when you're off of HCG but it says your
bodyweight<00:04:27.450> shouldn't<00:04:27.960> luckily<00:04:28.440> fluctuate

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
bodyweight shouldn't luckily fluctuate

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.600 
bodyweight shouldn't luckily fluctuate
too<00:04:29.430> much<00:04:29.610> um<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.930> if<00:04:31.470> you're<00:04:32.130> not<00:04:32.310> drinking

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610

too much um so if you're not drinking
enough<00:04:33.030> water<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:34.440> your<00:04:34.620> body<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:34.950> too

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
enough water and your body is too

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.190 
enough water and your body is too
hydrated<00:04:35.640> it's<00:04:35.790> actually<00:04:36.150> gonna<00:04:36.270> hold<00:04:36.600> on<00:04:36.960> to

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
hydrated it's actually gonna hold on to

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.920 
hydrated it's actually gonna hold on to
water<00:04:37.440> um<00:04:38.420> it's<00:04:39.420> like<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.600> don't<00:04:39.750> know<00:04:39.870> if

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
water um it's like I don't know if

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.480 
water um it's like I don't know if
you've<00:04:40.050> ever<00:04:40.200> had<00:04:40.350> like<00:04:40.410> pizza<00:04:41.010> one<00:04:41.280> night

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
you've ever had like pizza one night

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.220 
you've ever had like pizza one night
like<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.790> pizza<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.360> beer<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.930> next

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
like a pizza and a beer and the next

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.110 
like a pizza and a beer and the next
morning<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:44.010> feel<00:04:44.190> like<00:04:44.400> all<00:04:44.550> swollen<00:04:44.940> and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
morning you feel like all swollen and

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.760 
morning you feel like all swollen and
your<00:04:45.390> rings<00:04:45.570> won't<00:04:45.900> come<00:04:46.080> off<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.530> that's

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
your rings won't come off and that's

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.440 
your rings won't come off and that's
because<00:04:47.070> your<00:04:47.220> body<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.520> actually<00:04:48.030> retaining

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
because your body is actually retaining

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.200 
because your body is actually retaining
water<00:04:48.750> because<00:04:49.200> you're<00:04:49.430> dehydrated<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:51.030> it's

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
water because you're dehydrated so it's

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.090 
water because you're dehydrated so it's
holding<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:52.020> water<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:52.830> you're<00:04:53.010> gonna

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
holding on to water and so you're gonna

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.920 
holding on to water and so you're gonna
have<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.430> gain<00:04:53.730> on<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.060> scale<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.390> know<00:04:54.780> maybe

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
have a gain on the scale you know maybe

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.180 
have a gain on the scale you know maybe
1<00:04:55.200> 2<00:04:55.410> or<00:04:55.500> 3<00:04:55.560> pounds

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
1 2 or 3 pounds

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.790 
1 2 or 3 pounds
and<00:04:56.340> all<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.120> is<00:04:57.270> water<00:04:57.600> you<00:04:58.530> know

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
and all that is is water you know

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.470 
and all that is is water you know
because<00:04:58.980> of<00:04:59.070> all<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.220> sodium<00:04:59.820> that<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.270> had

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
because of all that sodium that you had

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.200 
because of all that sodium that you had
so<00:05:01.290> so<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.040> thought<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:02.430> was<00:05:02.520> interesting<00:05:02.700> tip

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
so so I thought that was interesting tip

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.790 
so so I thought that was interesting tip
the<00:05:03.480> other<00:05:03.630> thing<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.900> says<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.110> notice<00:05:04.650> how

bed in the morning you may not be

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.350 
bed in the morning you may not be
consuming<00:05:29.100> enough<00:05:29.310> fluids<00:05:29.760> so<00:05:30.000> if<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.210> wake

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
consuming enough fluids so if you wake

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.770 
consuming enough fluids so if you wake
up<00:05:30.540> thirsty<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.260> even<00:05:32.070> know<00:05:32.220> a<00:05:32.250> friend<00:05:32.610> who

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
up thirsty I even know a friend who

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.880 
up thirsty I even know a friend who
wakes<00:05:33.780> up<00:05:33.960> in<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.140> middle<00:05:34.350> of<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.710> night

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
wakes up in the middle of the night

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.590 
wakes up in the middle of the night
every<00:05:35.100> night<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.670> has<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:36.030> get<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.180> glass<00:05:36.390> of

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
every night and has to get a glass of

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.390 
every night and has to get a glass of
water<00:05:36.780> so<00:05:37.140> see<00:05:37.740> that<00:05:37.770> would<00:05:38.070> be<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.190> good

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
water so see that would be a good

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.700 
water so see that would be a good
indicator<00:05:38.880> that<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.330> person<00:05:39.780> is<00:05:39.960> dehydrated

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
indicator that that person is dehydrated

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.570 
indicator that that person is dehydrated
and<00:05:40.860> they're<00:05:40.950> not<00:05:41.070> drinking<00:05:41.340> enough

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
and they're not drinking enough

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
and they're not drinking enough
throughout<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.180> day<00:05:44.150> so<00:05:45.150> those<00:05:45.330> were<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:45.570> few

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
throughout the day so those were a few

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.630 
throughout the day so those were a few
things<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.260> I<00:05:46.290> thought<00:05:46.560> would<00:05:46.950> relate<00:05:47.340> as

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
things that I thought would relate as

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.600 
things that I thought would relate as
far<00:05:47.850> as<00:05:47.940> HCG<00:05:48.600> goes<00:05:48.950> and<00:05:49.950> then<00:05:50.160> it<00:05:50.190> mentions

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
far as HCG goes and then it mentions

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.460 
far as HCG goes and then it mentions
drink<00:05:50.910> one<00:05:51.090> thing<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.390> day<00:05:51.540> that's<00:05:51.750> not<00:05:52.020> water

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
drink one thing a day that's not water

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.170 
drink one thing a day that's not water
I'm<00:05:52.680> just<00:05:53.070> talking<00:05:53.400> about<00:05:53.550> keeping<00:05:54.030> your

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
I'm just talking about keeping your

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.750 
I'm just talking about keeping your
electrolyte<00:05:54.690> balance<00:05:54.950> it<00:05:55.950> mentions<00:05:56.430> even

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
electrolyte balance it mentions even

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.700 
electrolyte balance it mentions even
having<00:05:57.090> some<00:05:57.330> hot<00:05:57.570> tea<00:05:57.870> with<00:05:58.140> a<00:05:58.170> pinch<00:05:58.500> of<00:05:58.650> salt

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
having some hot tea with a pinch of salt

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.310 
having some hot tea with a pinch of salt
and<00:05:59.280> lemon<00:05:59.520> can<00:06:00.240> help<00:06:00.450> rebalance<00:06:00.840> your

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
and lemon can help rebalance your

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.840 
and lemon can help rebalance your
electrolytes<00:06:02.070> and<00:06:02.250> that's<00:06:02.430> something<00:06:02.700> that

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
electrolytes and that's something that

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.030 
electrolytes and that's something that
you<00:06:02.970> could<00:06:03.270> do<00:06:03.450> on<00:06:03.570> HCV<00:06:03.960> we<00:06:04.530> can't<00:06:04.830> have<00:06:05.010> a

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
you could do on HCV we can't have a

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.310 
you could do on HCV we can't have a
little<00:06:05.220> bit<00:06:05.460> of<00:06:05.550> lemon<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:06.030> salt<00:06:06.360> on<00:06:06.600> ECG<00:06:06.930> so

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
little bit of lemon and salt on ECG so

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.160 
little bit of lemon and salt on ECG so
you<00:06:07.860> know<00:06:07.980> that's<00:06:08.100> kind<00:06:08.310> of<00:06:08.550> a<00:06:08.640> nice<00:06:08.820> idea<00:06:09.170> so

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
you know that's kind of a nice idea so

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.760 
you know that's kind of a nice idea so
anyway<00:06:11.070> that's<00:06:11.220> interesting<00:06:11.910> um<00:06:12.710> yeah<00:06:13.710> that

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
anyway that's interesting um yeah that

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.920 
anyway that's interesting um yeah that
little<00:06:14.130> fact<00:06:14.400> I<00:06:14.550> found<00:06:14.880> is<00:06:15.180> that<00:06:15.330> water<00:06:15.600> makes

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
little fact I found is that water makes

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.620 
little fact I found is that water makes
up<00:06:16.140> 66<00:06:16.620> percent<00:06:17.280> of<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:17.580> human<00:06:17.730> body<00:06:18.060> so<00:06:18.270> we

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
up 66 percent of the human body so we

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.380 
up 66 percent of the human body so we
definitely<00:06:18.840> are<00:06:19.080> a<00:06:19.230> large<00:06:19.710> percent<00:06:20.370> water<00:06:20.640> and

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
definitely are a large percent water and

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.820 
definitely are a large percent water and
that's<00:06:21.540> why<00:06:21.720> it<00:06:21.780> is<00:06:21.900> important<00:06:22.410> to<00:06:22.500> get<00:06:22.650> our

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
that's why it is important to get our

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.330 
that's why it is important to get our
fluids<00:06:23.280> in<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:24.750> in<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.470> next<00:06:25.740> vlog<00:06:25.920> I'm<00:06:26.160> going

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
fluids in so in the next vlog I'm going

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.250 
fluids in so in the next vlog I'm going
to<00:06:26.460> talk<00:06:26.700> about<00:06:27.030> how<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.420> actually<00:06:27.720> do<00:06:28.020> that<00:06:28.170> on

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
to talk about how to actually do that on

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.860 
to talk about how to actually do that on
a<00:06:28.410> TCK<00:06:28.680> just<00:06:29.070> some<00:06:29.220> ideas<00:06:29.700> to<00:06:30.270> make<00:06:30.450> it<00:06:30.600> fun<00:06:30.840> or
