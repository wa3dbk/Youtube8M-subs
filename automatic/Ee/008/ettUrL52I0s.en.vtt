squid-like<00:00:20.720> Singh<00:00:21.230> here<00:00:21.910> so<00:00:22.910> let's<00:00:23.270> start

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
squid-like Singh here so let's start

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.820 
squid-like Singh here so let's start
from<00:00:23.660> scratch<00:00:24.430> creating<00:00:25.430> you<00:00:25.580> seen<00:00:26.770> create<00:00:27.770> a

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
from scratch creating you seen create a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.930 
from scratch creating you seen create a
common<00:00:28.400> object<00:00:29.560> make<00:00:30.560> it<00:00:30.740> 20<00:00:31.280> centimeters

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
common object make it 20 centimeters

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.270 
common object make it 20 centimeters
bottom<00:00:32.599> radius<00:00:33.080> give<00:00:33.830> it<00:00:34.040> 70<00:00:34.820> height<00:00:35.120> segments

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
bottom radius give it 70 height segments

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.470 
bottom radius give it 70 height segments
it's<00:00:37.280> very<00:00:37.430> necessary<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:38.270> have<00:00:38.330> a

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
it's very necessary that you have a

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.350 
it's very necessary that you have a
dense<00:00:38.870> mesh<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.560> make<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.040> band<00:00:40.760> properly

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
dense mesh to make it band properly

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.800 
dense mesh to make it band properly
later<00:00:41.630> on<00:00:42.370> select<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:43.460> can<00:00:43.700> object<00:00:43.940> press<00:00:44.570> C

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
later on select you can object press C

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.010 
later on select you can object press C
to<00:00:45.050> make<00:00:45.200> it<00:00:45.380> editable<00:00:46.060> and<00:00:47.060> we're<00:00:47.690> going<00:00:47.900> to

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
to make it editable and we're going to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.990 
to make it editable and we're going to
need<00:00:48.170> an<00:00:48.530> object<00:00:48.829> you<00:00:49.250> apply<00:00:49.520> our<00:00:49.700> hair

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
need an object you apply our hair

material to and in my case it's a

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.790 
material to and in my case it's a
platonic<00:00:54.410> object<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:56.380> with<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.500> object

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
platonic object and with the object

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.250 
platonic object and with the object
selected<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.399> go<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:58.579> use<00:00:58.850> simulation<00:00:59.600> hair

set<00:01:29.510> type<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.080> instance<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:30.830> you're<00:01:31.250> just

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
set type to instance and you're just

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.280 
set type to instance and you're just
going<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.850> drop<00:01:32.210> your<00:01:32.420> contour<00:01:32.840> drag<00:01:33.080> into

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
that slot here and let's render it for

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.510 
that slot here and let's render it for
now<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.510> can<00:01:38.690> still<00:01:39.080> see<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.680> hair<00:01:39.979> material

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
now you can still see the hair material

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.719 
now you can still see the hair material
is<00:01:40.700> shining<00:01:41.600> through<00:01:41.630> here<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.430> if<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.549> don't

render hairs in my first version I was
just<00:01:48.560> tricky<00:01:48.830> tricking<00:01:49.369> around<00:01:49.640> with<00:01:49.939> them

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
just tricky tricking around with them

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.310 
just tricky tricking around with them
with<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.830> ham<00:01:52.100> aterial<00:01:52.430> but<00:01:53.170> there<00:01:54.170> was<00:01:54.290> a

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
with the ham aterial but there was a

with the ham aterial but there was a
nice<00:01:54.530> guy<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.250> coments<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.729> who<00:01:56.000> told<00:01:56.210> me

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
nice guy in the coments of who told me

nice guy in the coments of who told me
add<00:01:56.509> just<00:01:56.720> these<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:57.439> render<00:01:57.740> yes<00:01:57.950> okay

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
add just these like render yes okay

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.670 
add just these like render yes okay
that's<00:01:58.790> very<00:01:58.880> very<00:01:59.390> very<00:02:00.200> easy<00:02:00.409> way<00:02:00.650> to

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
that's very very very easy way to

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.660 
that's very very very easy way to
improve<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:03.250> okay<00:02:04.250> let's<00:02:04.640> go<00:02:04.880> ahead<00:02:06.670> select

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
improve that okay let's go ahead select

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.699 
improve that okay let's go ahead select
your<00:02:07.820> hair<00:02:08.030> material<00:02:08.629> go<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.049> thickness

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
your hair material go to thickness

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.449 
your hair material go to thickness
that's<00:02:10.639> the<00:02:10.849> route<00:02:11.090> sickness<00:02:11.629> to<00:02:11.810> 20<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.430> you

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
that's the route sickness to 20 so you

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.320 
that's the route sickness to 20 so you
have

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
have

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.280 
have
just<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.170> know<00:02:15.400> thicker<00:02:16.690> thicker<00:02:17.690> roots<00:02:18.020> of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
just you know thicker thicker roots of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.390 
just you know thicker thicker roots of
your<00:02:18.410> hair<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.900> can<00:02:21.020> go<00:02:21.710> back<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.220> your

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
your hair so you can go back to your

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
your hair so you can go back to your
guides<00:02:22.820> make<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.720> make<00:02:24.560> everything<00:02:24.830> a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
guides make that make everything a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.130 
guides make that make everything a
little<00:02:25.250> bit<00:02:25.340> longer<00:02:25.730> let's<00:02:26.600> say<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> two

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
little bit longer let's say to two

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.220 
little bit longer let's say to two
hundred<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.620> fifty<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.930> assuming<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.020> you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
hundred and fifty and assuming that you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
some nice banding tentacles and if you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.980 
some nice banding tentacles and if you
move<00:02:36.680> around<00:02:36.980> your<00:02:37.190> hair<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:38.270> sorry<00:02:38.660> your

move around your hair you sorry your
platonic<00:02:39.380> object<00:02:40.540> your<00:02:41.540> tentacles<00:02:42.410> will

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
platonic object your tentacles will

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.110 
platonic object your tentacles will
follow<00:02:43.990> right<00:02:44.990> nice<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.680> deselect<00:02:49.670> your

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
follow right nice you can deselect your

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.750 
follow right nice you can deselect your
common<00:02:50.990> object<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.680> don't<00:02:51.890> need<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.220> see<00:02:52.459> that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.970 

just<00:02:55.760> stop<00:02:56.030> everything<00:02:56.060> here<00:02:56.720> yeah<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.709> go<00:02:57.920> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
just stop everything here yeah you go to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.470 
just stop everything here yeah you go to
your<00:02:58.400> hair<00:02:59.260> and<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.530> forces<00:03:01.220> set<00:03:01.880> hair<00:03:02.300> -

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
your hair and go to forces set hair -

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.400 
your hair and go to forces set hair -
here<00:03:02.780> here<00:03:03.650> -<00:03:03.680> surface<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:06.110> give<00:03:06.380> a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
here here - surface and you give a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.880 
here here - surface and you give a
little<00:03:06.680> bit<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:06.890> dynamics<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.640> your<00:03:07.910> tentacles

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
little bit of dynamics to your tentacles

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.010 
little bit of dynamics to your tentacles
you<00:03:09.890> can<00:03:10.100> decrease<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.610> radius<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.390> your<00:03:11.630> and

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
you can decrease the radius of your and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.180 
you can decrease the radius of your and
platonic<00:03:12.560> object<00:03:12.950> let's<00:03:13.370> set<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.670> down<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.150> 30

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
platonic object let's set it down to 30

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.800 
platonic object let's set it down to 30
oops<00:03:16.190> like<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:17.140> yeah<00:03:18.230> let's<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:20.420> let<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
oops like that yeah let's so let the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.840 
oops like that yeah let's so let the
result<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:23.120> step<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.550> can

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
result of that of that step and you can

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.690 
result of that of that step and you can
of<00:03:26.090> course<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.600> can<00:03:26.840> add<00:03:27.050> other<00:03:27.920> objects<00:03:28.489> to

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
of course you can add other objects to

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.000 
of course you can add other objects to
your<00:03:28.880> scene<00:03:29.269> like<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.489> little<00:03:31.489> Bowl<00:03:31.700> here

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
your scene like that little Bowl here

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.009 
your scene like that little Bowl here
you<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.250> add<00:03:36.489> like<00:03:37.489> your<00:03:37.730> hair<00:03:38.239> collide

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
you can add like your hair collide

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.540 
you can add like your hair collide
attack<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.880> and

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.540 

you<00:03:45.820> can<00:03:46.090> have<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.390> little<00:03:46.840> bit<00:03:46.990> of

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
you can have a little bit of

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.100 
you can have a little bit of
interactivity<00:03:48.550> between<00:03:48.910> your<00:03:49.630> objects<00:03:50.260> here

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
interactivity between your objects here

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.250 
interactivity between your objects here
all<00:03:53.110> right

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.770 

well<00:03:57.500> there's<00:03:57.920> an<00:03:58.099> issue<00:03:58.220> with<00:03:58.580> with<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> ham

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
well there's an issue with with the ham

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.550 
well there's an issue with with the ham
what<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.230> know<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.709> have<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:03.440> you

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
what you know that you have that you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.890 
what you know that you have that you
have<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.860> little<00:04:04.069> bit<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:04.870> intersection<00:04:05.870> here

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
have a little bit of intersection here

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.479 
have a little bit of intersection here
and<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:08.299> can<00:04:08.480> try<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.840> play<00:04:09.260> around<00:04:09.560> with<00:04:09.799> your

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
and you can try to play around with your

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.699 
and you can try to play around with your
forces<00:04:11.209> radius<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.200> with<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.470> force

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
forces radius and with the force

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.060 
forces radius and with the force
strength<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.819> improve<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.510> result<00:04:15.040> but<00:04:16.040> as

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
strength to improve that result but as

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.180 
strength to improve that result but as
far<00:04:16.970> as<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.269> found<00:04:17.510> out<00:04:17.690> there's<00:04:18.079> no<00:04:18.380> way<00:04:18.650> with

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
far as I found out there's no way with

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
far as I found out there's no way with
hair<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.880> avoid<00:04:20.150> intersection<00:04:21.139> at<00:04:21.829> all<00:04:22.210> but

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
hair to avoid intersection at all but

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.870 
hair to avoid intersection at all but
anyway<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:24.110> nice<00:04:24.500> um<00:04:24.860> technique<00:04:25.370> to

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
anyway it's a nice um technique to

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.960 
anyway it's a nice um technique to
create<00:04:26.229> tentacles<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.440> seafoody<00:04:27.949> very<00:04:28.639> fast

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
create tentacles and seafoody very fast

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.969 
create tentacles and seafoody very fast
very<00:04:29.300> easy<00:04:29.539> and<00:04:30.310> if<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.430> want<00:04:31.699> to<00:04:31.930> apply

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
very easy and if you want to apply

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.409 
very easy and if you want to apply
another<00:04:33.979> material<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.820> your<00:04:34.970> hair<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.240> just

have to make a new material just modify
it<00:04:40.850> in<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.240> way<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.389> think<00:04:42.020> it's<00:04:42.169> good<00:04:42.470> let's

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
it in the way you think it's good let's

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.170 
it in the way you think it's good let's
make<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.669> red<00:04:44.060> for<00:04:44.090> example<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.940> just<00:04:46.940> add<00:04:47.120> it

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180

to your hair and just override the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.930 
to your hair and just override the
