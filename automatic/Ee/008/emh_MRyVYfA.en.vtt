00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 good morning girls today I wanted to talk 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.040
 of this bb queen because it proves its own 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.230
 proof proof proof proof is me 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.969
 the minitalia practically ended then 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.289
 before throwing it I wanted to give you mine 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.220
 opinion from here is part of the same 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:24.650
 series of mini sizes of which I already had 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 talked about that other pink and cream bb 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 precisely this is called here 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.000
 walfare job beep beep beep beep e 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.640
 the water make up and says i chase ed 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.230
 exclusive a rising monster of which one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.750
 which makes your skin boys empty 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 which is and generated new apply to skin 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.870
 jewel of short into your skin then not 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.280
 I want to dwell on why I told you 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.800
 I had to do that video series 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.770
 little ones in which opinion but I like 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.699
 until then the effect on the face e 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:06.930
 this then I hate wearing the baby 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.000
 clip and above the ground and buy it 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.240
 I would buy it back no 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.409
 no, because then first of all I'll do it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.409
 see the application 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.920
 then the entire face make-up 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.440
 normally I use the brush that also from 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.440
 an effect that I like 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:14.620
 then the face appears a little blanching 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.620
 I'd say pretty uniformly 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:30.760
 effect in my opinion not exceptional here 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.280
 you have seen that the effect on the skin and 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.190
 so light but so light that almost 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.140
 you don't notice anything in the sense I think 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.750
 if I had only put the earth, you would not 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.930
 would see this big difference then 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.690
 as a base and it's not bad because it is 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.209
 extremely light it performs a lot in 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.390
 hurry the color that initially seems 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.670
 a little grey then it oxidizes and becomes 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.800
 nice on the skin but there is to say that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.709
 I have at this stage of my life 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.190
 skin without practically imperfections 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.769
 ie I have no redness I have no pimples and it is a 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.530
 place the skin as well as for one 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.900
 any person who has one though 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.610
 minimum imperfection to be covered 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.560
 I think this goes on too 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.330
 too too light so that's fine 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.010
 light effect proto point if you don't 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.560
 I have to put nothing I don't wear anything 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.609
 I do therefore first between the two 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:29.530
 definitely then this if you want 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.900
 in addition to the base, a no, sorry too 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.480
 the other the pink one if besides the base 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.880
 you want a little more decent coverage na 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.930
 this instead if you don't have any kind 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.209
 of imperfection and you only want 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:48.549
 smooth the skin to give an effect 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.079
 the more we say in my opinion homogeneous 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.769
 then this is fine if you have a 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.630
 some minimum of buffalo dyschromia 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.700
 blush what I think this is 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.989
 really too much too much too much 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.690
 light 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.910
 the positive thing in quotes is that 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.470
 being absolutely really read 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.180
 like water this thing when the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.250
 put on the face you can safely 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.200
 put your moisturizer underneath 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.140
 the other if well remembered with under the 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.459
 cream was a little heavy 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.320
 perhaps having an opacity even a little 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.380
 most noticeable the high I used it with 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.480
 only serum without cream 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.750
 instead with this I normally put the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.850
 my moisturizer then this is so 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.330
 slight that the two products do not 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.220
 clash ok so I give you enough 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.460
 I recommend it only if for 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.610
 the note you have nothing to cover 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.410
 on the face but you just want to give some 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.680
 uniformity of the complexion if tomorrow wines 7 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.160
 anyway a nice idea to try 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.480
 both products otherwise know 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.210
 that I'm trying another cream with the 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.330
 big that I had taken and metro bb 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.980
 sorry I'll use it for a couple of 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.990
 weeks later I will also talk about that 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.180
 which, however, is quite pleasing to me already 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.320
 from the first application for the rest 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.320
 to the next
