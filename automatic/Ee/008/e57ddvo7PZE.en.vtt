00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
year when you care they're not the best

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.359 
year when you care they're not the best
they<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.850> ever<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.020> these<00:01:40.590> ones<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.159> all

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
they can ever be but these ones are all

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
they can ever be but these ones are all
care<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.939> got<00:01:42.299> them<00:01:42.450> from<00:01:42.659> Morrison's<00:01:45.439> our

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439

care just got them from Morrison's our
strawberries<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> UK<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.470> donned

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
strawberries here in the UK they donned

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.020 
strawberries here in the UK they donned
they're<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.390> nice<00:01:51.780> until<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> summer

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
they're not really nice until the summer

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.920 
they're not really nice until the summer
so<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.210> melt<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.479> starting

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so this is it's just melt it's starting

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
so this is it's just melt it's starting
to<00:01:58.049> melt<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.500> bottom<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.219> don't<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.180> why

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
to melt in the bottom I don't know why

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.600 
to melt in the bottom I don't know why
this<00:02:00.509> makes<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.290> difference<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.310> push

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
this makes a difference but if you push

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.719 
this makes a difference but if you push
the<00:02:02.850> chocolate<00:02:03.390> down<00:02:03.659> into<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> melted

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
the chocolate down into the melted

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.070 
the chocolate down into the melted
chocolate<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> bottom<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.039> seems<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:09.080> stop

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
chocolate in the bottom it seems to stop

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.949 
chocolate in the bottom it seems to stop
it<00:02:10.259> burning<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:11.009> me<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.489> probably<00:02:11.970> depends<00:02:12.750> on

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
it burning for me it probably depends on

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.290 
it burning for me it probably depends on
him

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
him

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.640 
him
microwave<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.640> more<00:02:19.000> than<00:02:19.030> 30<00:02:19.630> seconds<00:02:20.320> there

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
microwave so more than 30 seconds there

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.000 
microwave so more than 30 seconds there
I<00:02:20.950> think<00:02:21.490> these<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.390> might<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.590> put<00:02:23.890> them

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
I think these I might have to put them

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.790 
I think these I might have to put them
in<00:02:24.160> for<00:02:24.340> another<00:02:24.490> 10<00:02:25.000> or<00:02:25.300> 20<00:02:26.080> seconds<00:02:26.650> but

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
in for another 10 or 20 seconds but

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.320 
in for another 10 or 20 seconds but
we'll<00:02:27.010> see<00:02:27.250> what<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> light<00:02:27.790> when<00:02:28.000> they<00:02:28.120> come

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
we'll see what the light when they come

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.480 
we'll see what the light when they come
out<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.300> if<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.960> possibly<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.860> try

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
out and so the if you possibly can try

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.790 
out and so the if you possibly can try
and<00:02:33.700> leave<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.910> stems<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.780> them<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.260> you'll

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
and leave the stems on them and you'll

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.030 
and leave the stems on them and you'll
see<00:02:36.100> why<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.820> minute<00:02:37.050> some<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.200> mine<00:02:38.470> haven't

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
see why in a minute some of mine haven't

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.730 
see why in a minute some of mine haven't
got<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.370> stems<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.350> just

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
got the stems on so for that you just

00:02:41.740 --> 00:03:01.050 
got the stems on so for that you just
need<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> car<00:02:58.740> there<00:02:59.740> you<00:02:59.950> see<00:03:00.010> it's<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.760> lot<00:03:01.030> more

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
need a car there you see it's a lot more

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.180 
need a car there you see it's a lot more
melted<00:03:01.930> now<00:03:02.170> but<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.620> still<00:03:02.920> quite<00:03:03.310> chunky

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
melted now but it's still quite chunky

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.640 
melted now but it's still quite chunky
so<00:03:06.190> I'm<00:03:06.520> actually<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.660> put<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.440> in<00:03:08.620> for

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
so I'm actually going to put that in for

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:26.000 
so I'm actually going to put that in for
another<00:03:10.710> 20<00:03:11.710> seconds<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.490> think

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.259 

yes<00:03:26.700> or<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.019> haven't<00:03:28.349> got<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> stem<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.269> just

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
yes or if you haven't got a stem I just

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.539 
yes or if you haven't got a stem I just
use<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.780> fork<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.349> stick<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.099> if<00:03:32.310> that

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
use the fork and stick it in and if that

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.069 
use the fork and stick it in and if that
dip<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.970> into<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.269> chocolate<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.959> way<00:03:36.079> we

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
dip it into the chocolate that way we

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.929 
dip it into the chocolate that way we
might<00:03:37.110> run<00:03:37.590> out<00:03:37.620> with<00:03:37.920> chocolaty<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.519> think

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
might run out with chocolaty I think

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.839 
might run out with chocolaty I think
there's<00:03:39.150> too<00:03:39.329> many<00:03:39.540> strawberries<00:03:40.730> for<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
there's too many strawberries for the

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:50.500

amount<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.299> chocolate<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.310> see

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
amount of chocolate and so you see

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.009

really like it so it's just as well
really<00:05:03.300> isn't<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:05.280> first<00:05:05.610> time<00:05:06.090> I

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
really isn't it and the first time I

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.149 
really isn't it and the first time I
ever<00:05:06.750> had<00:05:07.560> these<00:05:07.889> we<00:05:08.580> were<00:05:08.760> in<00:05:08.880> Disneyland<00:05:09.539> and

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
ever had these we were in Disneyland and

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.080 
ever had these we were in Disneyland and
I<00:05:11.159> think<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.270> was<00:05:12.449> at<00:05:12.630> there<00:05:13.639> it<00:05:14.639> wasn't<00:05:15.060> the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
I think it was at there it wasn't the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.290 
I think it was at there it wasn't the
Magic<00:05:15.539> Kingdom<00:05:15.750> it<00:05:16.139> was<00:05:16.289> MGM<00:05:16.919> Studios<00:05:17.639> i<00:05:17.880> think

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
Magic Kingdom it was MGM Studios i think

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.439 
Magic Kingdom it was MGM Studios i think
it<00:05:18.479> was<00:05:18.599> MGM<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:19.440> there<00:05:20.400> was<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.699> big<00:05:21.000> Mickey

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
it was MGM and there was this big Mickey

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.390 
it was MGM and there was this big Mickey
Mouse<00:05:21.690> shore<00:05:22.139> on<00:05:22.729> outside<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:24.949> we<00:05:25.949> sat<00:05:26.250> in

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
Mouse shore on outside and we sat in

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.800 
Mouse shore on outside and we sat in
there<00:05:26.639> in<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:27.030> these<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:28.590> think<00:05:29.419> that<00:05:30.419> time

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
there in it these and I think that time

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.930 
there in it these and I think that time
as<00:05:31.110> well<00:05:31.639> we<00:05:32.639> got<00:05:33.030> some<00:05:33.060> rocky<00:05:33.659> road<00:05:34.639> just<00:05:35.639> been

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
as well we got some rocky road just been

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.590 
as well we got some rocky road just been
utter<00:05:36.240> pigs

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
utter pigs

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.200 
utter pigs
and<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:40.500> we<00:05:41.500> add<00:05:41.680> that<00:05:42.010> so<00:05:42.340> whenever<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:42.940> deal

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
and and we add that so whenever I deal

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.200 
and and we add that so whenever I deal
these<00:05:43.420> I<00:05:43.480> always<00:05:44.110> think<00:05:44.410> of<00:05:45.250> being<00:05:46.030> in

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
these I always think of being in

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.670 
these I always think of being in
Disneyland<00:05:48.360> as<00:05:49.360> you<00:05:49.600> see<00:05:49.840> when<00:05:50.080> it<00:05:50.200> gets<00:05:50.440> at

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
Disneyland as you see when it gets at

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.680 
Disneyland as you see when it gets at
the<00:05:50.770> bottom<00:05:51.190> a<00:05:51.310> bit<00:05:51.490> it's<00:05:51.700> a<00:05:51.850> bit<00:05:52.060> harder<00:05:52.660> to

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
the bottom a bit it's a bit harder to
