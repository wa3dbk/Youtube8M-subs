00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.070
 Hello people with a bunch of plums on my 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.930
 nerds and if so give now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.939
 nerds foot should we swing 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 stamina and an example will be here 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.320
 pretty nice though it's not 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.140
 help Istomin who is his kid 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.329
 character on Peter but at the same time I 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.610
 sent downs half of his gear 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'm just a diagnostician reluctant dog all the same 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 what the result is why i decided so 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.800
 thought for one main reason for 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 when close he was that both mountains winning 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 In principle, they played LSD that is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 affliction afflek ribbons or mental 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.770
 shaman and more than once and chest and they played 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.120
 very protective they are 100 kirov sheets well 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.280
 here is 1 tea growth and clap it sake rest on 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.489
 stamina and all that is consideration 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.950
 I marvel at how so fuck a fig 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 you become lawyers and at the same time I am so 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.030
 I thought well, what do we have in person? 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 put on the wild and either varnish 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.590
 make great results and numbers 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 got and basically pretty or 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.460
 then you are not bad 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.150
 and we will lose it five percent 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.320
 force 3. 2 percent crit if they have 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.890
 fog and of course human and here too 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.970
 time we are somewhere for very much it is over 10 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 percent. 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.290
 and do 12 5. and all our nki 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 besides legions are much stronger too 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.189
 I will become and shorter when on Peter gram or 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 there is a hit movie about up to 22 thousand two 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.509
 thousand tamar 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.360
 Here we plant a couple of ren first there 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.580
 lost in 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.520
 but at the same time that he noticed something 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.460
 I was focused a little I actually van 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.040
 the hall rack much more cases like this 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.290
 than a lose shorter we lose 1905 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.900
 crit we will lose thirteen thousand 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.360
 by force but at the same time we acquire 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:16.420
 from 435 a amine material 1435 by force 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.610
 together with our actions or 1151 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.090
 when our garden foundations prokatsya 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.470
 that is, it is somewhere in the 5 percent strength 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.200
 coming 3. 2 percent of the cells here we are too 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.550
 time to sleep his neck 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.920
 attacker stats will be increased write 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.489
 percent 5 percent of pi pi force and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.390
 reduced by 80 percent because we have 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.520
 There is a deal here and in short, I looked like that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.040
 although mac-down food is not bad, we 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.250
 losing here but at the same time we 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.560
 we get yes bows big big 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.680
 start our survival rate that is we 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.840
 we acquire in principle 80. 8 percent 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.860
 hp too 12.09 percent more hp we 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.519
 will run 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.030
 our mask will take a will rise a 163 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.380
 thousands got 83,000 that's possible 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.239
 for cd what is 12.26 percent 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.290
 increase and converter around 12.1 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.269
 the patient will rise too 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.549
 there are two rooms are not bad but not the same 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.160
 while rises on exr 10 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.410
 percent because we are to the ramb set of 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.209
 bloody stance and at the same time when u 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.030
 us as packaged only more 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.000
 arma gives this center becomes even 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 stronger because we will have more 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.040
 armor on us here and at the same time msx 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.769
 dancing is much stronger 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.590
 if you are going to run with the neck 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.950
 have seen rhyming and which reduces 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.170
 recharge MSK in the record of how much 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.360
 A review would be left on you and when I'm for not 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.400
 great simulation i mean i turned out 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.500
 as a pity conduct a 1000 review of kin m with y 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.680
 you create and either 13 or 32000 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.980
 if you become lawyers well or not and your 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.660
 Moscow dream or on 3. 2 seconds either on 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.370
 7 2 seconds and that's 10 percent difference 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.890
 that is, if you will be soccer. 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.230
 your obligatory brain even dreams on 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.560
 10 percent and at the same time big 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.810
 question is it worth it or not 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.150
 firstly because you will run 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.430
 more in the archaic rack I think this 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.250
 pretty worth it of course not worth it 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.620
 straight on stand this bryansk stupid 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.870
 jam as they say against each 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.780
 teams but if you have a lot 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.410
 focuses and especially the horn will be their 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.720
 the authors 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.030
 you just pond obey the design and 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.200
 because there is a lot of damage to wild affairs 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.990
 either magicians 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.180
 I think it's worth it. 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.169
 time these be Iranian cougars on the carpet from 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.980
 not a lot of wild sit then of course 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:00.470
 go more with attacking stats so 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.320
 how at the end of the season we can somewhere 20 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.840
 have i think why not why 20 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.200
 This will be them I will stream this 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.900
 all look viewed and pain in this 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.760
 meaning or not and let you know for lacquers 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.669
 by the way it's even more you lose more 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.070
 damage but you get more points 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.200
 thanks for watching the next one 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.200
 botanical video and bye
