00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.740 

now<00:01:53.680> what<00:01:53.860> we<00:01:53.950> don't<00:01:54.130> do<00:01:54.400> with<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.610> sardine<00:01:55.090> in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
now what we don't do with a sardine in

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.050 
now what we don't do with a sardine in
the<00:01:56.260> areas<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:56.650> do<00:01:56.830> have<00:01:57.010> starting<00:01:57.430> is<00:01:57.670> collar

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the areas we do have starting is collar

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.490 
the areas we do have starting is collar
hook<00:01:58.300> them<00:01:58.450> but<00:01:58.570> there's<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.810> lot<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:59.020> areas

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
hook them but there's a lot of areas

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500 
hook them but there's a lot of areas
that<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.100> mix<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.700> sardines<00:02:01.210> and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
that you have a mix of sardines and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.440 
that you have a mix of sardines and
anchovies<00:02:02.640> where<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.820> do<00:02:03.970> want<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.270> have

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
anchovies where you do want to have

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.540 
anchovies where you do want to have
another<00:02:04.720> technique<00:02:05.140> if<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.410> know<00:02:05.770> hook<00:02:06.160> of<00:02:06.310> an

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
another technique if you know hook of an

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.890 
another technique if you know hook of an
anchovy<00:02:07.000> unless<00:02:07.330> it's<00:02:07.540> up<00:02:07.660> through<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
anchovy unless it's up through the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.240 
anchovy unless it's up through the
bottom<00:02:08.050> listen<00:02:08.470> up<00:02:08.590> through<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.890> top<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.100> the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
bottom listen up through the top of the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.090 
bottom listen up through the top of the
head<00:02:09.720> an<00:02:10.720> anchovy<00:02:11.140> will<00:02:11.410> die<00:02:11.560> very<00:02:11.830> very

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
head an anchovy will die very very

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.320 
head an anchovy will die very very
quickly<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.730> doesn't<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:13.240> strong

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
quickly because it doesn't have a strong

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.240 
quickly because it doesn't have a strong
enough<00:02:13.660> jaw<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.110> keep<00:02:14.290> its<00:02:14.440> mouth<00:02:14.620> closed<00:02:14.980> so

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
enough jaw to keep its mouth closed so

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.010 
enough jaw to keep its mouth closed so
you<00:02:15.670> want<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.000> make<00:02:16.120> sure<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.660> learn<00:02:16.840> how

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
you want to make sure that you learn how

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.420 
you want to make sure that you learn how
to<00:02:17.050> do<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> collar<00:02:17.590> hook<00:02:17.950> now<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.400> a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
to do a collar hook now this is a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.460 
to do a collar hook now this is a
sardine<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.630> were<00:02:19.750> an<00:02:19.870> anchovy<00:02:20.260> you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
sardine but if it were an anchovy you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.650 
sardine but if it were an anchovy you
come<00:02:20.650> right<00:02:20.890> behind<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.430> gill<00:02:21.670> plate<00:02:21.700> right

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
come right behind the gill plate right

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.030 
come right behind the gill plate right
behind<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.050> gill<00:02:23.230> plate<00:02:23.260> there's<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.800> little

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
behind the gill plate there's a little

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.920 
behind the gill plate there's a little
hard<00:02:24.340> bone<00:02:24.700> collar<00:02:25.090> right<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.720> stick

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
hard bone collar right there you stick

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.630 
hard bone collar right there you stick
it<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.290> there<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.560> come<00:02:26.740> out<00:02:27.010> right

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
it in right there and come out right

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.030 
it in right there and come out right
behind<00:02:27.940> there<00:02:28.270> it's<00:02:28.690> not<00:02:28.900> necessary<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
behind there it's not necessary with a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.370 
behind there it's not necessary with a
sardine<00:02:30.490> because<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.940> sardine<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:32.020> swim<00:02:32.350> a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
sardine because the sardine can swim a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.040 
sardine because the sardine can swim a
lot<00:02:32.650> stronger<00:02:33.070> with<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.520> nose<00:02:33.790> hook<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.570> reason

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
lot stronger with a nose hook the reason

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.140 
lot stronger with a nose hook the reason
you<00:02:35.440> want<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.740> use<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.920> nose<00:02:36.250> hook<00:02:36.460> on<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> sardine

you want to use a nose hook on a sardine

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.820 
you want to use a nose hook on a sardine
is<00:02:37.300> because<00:02:37.570> many<00:02:37.810> times<00:02:37.900> you'll<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.560> bit

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
is because many times you'll get bit

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.680 
is because many times you'll get bit
when<00:02:39.070> you're<00:02:39.160> reeling<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.670> sardines<00:02:40.120> back<00:02:40.390> in
