 Hello everyone, welcome to my eighth knife video 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.160
 we are here with this knife, Magnum by Boker 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.700
 let's open it 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.860
 we immediately see the instructions given to us by the German house 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.660
 this is the guarantee 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 here we have this ... 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.580
 manual that I don't know what it says ... 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 when I have time to translate German ... 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.520
 ... I'll let you know what he says 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.100
 here is the knife as it presents itself 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.380
 very beautiful 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.380
 I'll show you the details of the handle 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.300
 liner-lock closure and trouser clip 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 a good knife 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.020
 here we have the allen 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.480
 for the various screws that are there 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.980
 very nice box included in the price 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.120
 let's go and test the knife 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.760
 let's take a green sprig first 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.100
 we see that it cuts everything without problems 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.420
 let's take something more often 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.960
 a dry wood 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.400
 zero problems 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.700
 I must say that this knife is my favorite, I like it a lot 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 the cost is around 31 euros 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.540
 it's really worth what it costs 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 I have to say that the German quality of this knife really feels, because the blade life is remarkable 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.880
 now it's about 3 years that I have it 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.920
 and for this Magnum by Boker knife it's all from Parafrantz.
