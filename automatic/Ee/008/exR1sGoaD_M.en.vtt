00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hey i am valentin and when light up 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.370
 So our retina hits light particles 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.900
 photons or light waves then 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.880
 These will be there in electrical impulses 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 these electrical pulses are converted 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.080
 are in our brain to the center here 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 be forwarded in the back of the head and be 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 interpreted there and we see that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.019
 then as colors but you have times 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 asked if we maybe even 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.769
 so we shine not only if we light 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.750
 but maybe also 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.329
 The light source is therefore not just for 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 example orange back rays because that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.120
 light here for example on my t 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.890
 shirt wants and that will shine you now 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.680
 only the orange shares back or whether 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.440
 We also own our own people 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 like a lamp and that's what you wanted 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.579
 researcher at the jersey institute of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 Find out technology in sendai 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.699
 that's in japan and these researchers 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.100
 have to recognize with an ultra good light 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.059
 camera even single photons 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.770
 can recognize 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.840
 Pictures of the samples made in the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.270
 sat in a completely darkened room 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.270
 and they found out that everyone 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 human being shines every human being shines 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.869
 then shines more in the face than 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.520
 otherwise one suspects that it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.740
 because of the melanie it is so 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.630
 house dyes eg on the hair colored 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.009
 because this helps only guest 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.350
 components but the intensity varies 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.420
 we know that at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 the intensity is the lowest at 16 o'clock 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780
 In the afternoon, the intensity is stronger 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 and we suspect that it also with the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.470
 metabolism is related to ours 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.590
 body has and with our inner clock 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.450
 Although about 1,000 times weaker 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 as the human eye can recognize 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.659
 but we shine in visible light 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.460
 that means I'm not talking about here 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.829
 Infrared light not from heat radiation 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.930
 but of really visible light 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.399
 So not something in the spectrum of ours 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.189
 Eyes is what we can see red 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.850
 green blue pink purple what you want 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.130
 but what brings us that now 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.630
 because this light up the intensity 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.890
 really with our metabolism 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.439
 we can relate to that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.330
 Find out if metabolic diseases 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.310
 we can diagnose whether 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.890
 a person a healthy or a person 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.500
 has sick metabolism 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.300
 and well if we can recognize that 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.700
 Of course we have to add the colors 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.350
 can see that the light can see 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.150
 It's about the cameras but synonymous then 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.430
 through the monitors this reinforce us 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.700
 we can then recognize if a person 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.560
 well still very healthy is interesting 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.750
 in the spot is that men and women 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.209
 We do not see colors immediately 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.430
 that women probably hear better 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.690
 as men also brings on taste 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.330
 should react and touch-sensitive 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.950
 as men but explorers of the city 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.069
 University of New York found out now 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.470
 that women see differently than mine 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.239
 Men and women see different 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.980
 Men, for example, can be weak 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.650
 contrasts and fast movements better 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.170
 recognize and process as women and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.390
 Seen equal stimuli same fares 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 always as something bluish as women 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.760
 that means women see the world a bit 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.670
 warmer than men 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.200
 So in terms of color but overall 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.000
 the difference is not really big so 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.500
 men women look relatively similar to man 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.530
 but can prove that it 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.359
 really is not quite the same and you 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.609
 suspected that this is due to testosterone 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.440
 testosterone promotes the unborn in the 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.299
 Formation of brain cells in the visual center 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.030
 and of nerve connections and that's why 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.560
 one assumes that thereby men 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.400
 recognize smaller contrasts better 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.019
 can as women 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.090
 but as I said it is relatively similar 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.620
 and I link you an article of the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.120
 all of them are written below 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.220
 other sources is of course in the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.410
 video description but see all 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.230
 people are all the same, that's the same 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.239
 what I call red when I am 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.280
 through your head could look through 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.049
 and could see your interpretation 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.359
 also the red what my brain 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.220
 the red is what I interpret as interpreted 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.770
 good also refers to your bread or 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.720
 Do you call that 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.000
 green if you go through my head 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.020
 could see what kind of a 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.090
 interesting question 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.190
 but we have to assume first 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.290
 that colors are illusion sin colors 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.480
 not really existent it's easy 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.310
 only photon on our suppositories 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.260
 meet and these suppositories solve one 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.180
 pulse out and this electric pulse 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.830
 Our brain goes pulse and gets there 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.600
 that means colors 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.640
 do not really exist but are 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.010
 only illusion only interpretations 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.330
 our brain of the world though 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.420
 Let us consider the following 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.400
 situation we have a banana and we 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.310
 reddish light sit inside here 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.540
 and the banana is money and if we are 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.520
 go out now a little friendlier 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.110
 the banana is still daylight 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.840
 yellow or if we go to a studio 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.090
 with light what 5500 carina so cold 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.520
 White light is the banana still 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.720
 money and from that we see our brain 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.880
 does not rank at the particular 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.820
 wavelength to a particular color too 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.120
 but takes recognizes from the context 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.640
 from what a color is and 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.410
 interpreted a color and that 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.880
 means the color appears the same 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.030
 instead of being different 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.950
 the intra-individual variability 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.170
 makes colors equal instead 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.530
 different and that means ours 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.540
 brain encoded relative color contrasts 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.790
 and when different people 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.970
 different numbers of thongs 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.000
 on her retina so her skin have the 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.310
 in the eye in charge is not around 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.020
 to take impulses one believes that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.810
 Nevertheless, all the people are the colors 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.940
 about the same as the suppositories are 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.130
 by the way, responsible for the color vision and 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.410
 The sticks are bright and dark 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.940
 are responsive rather than the 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.150
 suppositories so if it is very dark 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.810
 we see only black and white but she 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.060
 now all people are green as green is that 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.220
 green what I train in my head 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.040
 also green at least I call that 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.729
 here for example as red but it could 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.639
 when I see what you see 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.110
 Do you call this red and that? 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.319
 we do not know if 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.839
 with someone else with you because of me 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.610
 that's exactly how it is or if the world is included 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.529
 you may look very different 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.509
 you interpreted the world differently 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.430
 that's why the question we see the world 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.319
 same or is it different though 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.650
 like, for example, I explain one 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.749
 blind what colors are which 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.120
 I have to use a combination of words 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.499
 only the color in his head appears 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.360
 to leave if he has never before 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:24.059
 I have described the color in detail 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.159
 feeling for someone else never 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:27.449
 this feeling had felt which 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.219
 I have to combine words 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.610
 use that at the same time 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:35.099
 head emerges 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.589
 we have no combination of hope 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.569
 at least no one knows us and that 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:41.789
 means as long as that can not have 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.370
 We do not know if other people are the ones 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.020
 see colors the same way as we or not 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.909
 is just not going to want it 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.710
 just do not know 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.050
 maybe someday it will work 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.749
 but not yet there is a thing that 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.889
 We know and I am a valentin in 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:57.889
 our world is fantastic
