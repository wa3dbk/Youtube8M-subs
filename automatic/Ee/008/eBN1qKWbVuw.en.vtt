00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.160
 hi hello here I am again for 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.760
 show you a new point today touches the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 low the lowest point is essential 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.580
 to make them amigurumi in fact I am 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.680
 the one that I use the most 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.690
 chose a wool more or less of this 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.360
 thickness so you can see it well and color 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.059
 orange so that it also stands out 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.640
 I will do as the other time the number crochet 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.500
 3 because more or less is the same wool 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.739
 we could also do well maybe a 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.600
 number 4 1 3 and a half are neither measures 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.490
 exact depends a little on the person and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.300
 of what goes well 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.390
 let's start with a very 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.800
 simple chain- based 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.330
 you can use the magic ring is another other 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.430
 different starting point that you already 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.530
 I will teach later but I think it is 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.780
 easier to start then for some 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.440
 simple chains we make the knot 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.530
 sliding that consists of a normal knot 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.530
 simply because we went through here 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.610
 the thread as I already taught in the other 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.530
 tutorial lockstitch chainstitch and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.290
 now we do 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.350
 let's put four chainlets not five 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 We are going to make a chain 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.729
 two 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.729
 d 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:41.070
 4 time 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.299
 let's make one more 66 chains a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.240
 Once we have them done we click the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.760
 crochet hook tip to the first 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.050
 point 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.050
 so that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.920
 let's put the crochet linked to the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.190
 first to the first chain stitch one 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.270
 Once we have it, we pass the thread 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.300
 will be hooked at the end logically 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.430
 we passed it behind the crochet and with 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.000
 the hook again we help each other 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.180
 pass it first through a hole 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.180
 and then 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.540
 come first through a hole and 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.819
 then on the other 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.819
 so that we have one round 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.209
 chain stitch fan 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.900
 once we have this 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.150
 if we look closely we can see 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.090
 different the different chains and we 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.599
 will serve to make the next round 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.459
 we will make low points we nail the 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.459
 crochet on the first chain 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.650
 Y 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.129
 we put the thread behind the crochet 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:15.500
 that many times already will be and we move 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.880
 through the first hole 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.730
 so that we will stay 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.970
 these little loops we go through again 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.100
 the thread from behind and this time if 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.490
 we go through one first and then through the 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.620
 other 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.970
 we have made our first low point 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.220
 what would it be like here 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.730
 to signal that here we started the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.190
 round the round that we will make them 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.370
 around the whole circle we are going to 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.580
 put some sort of point or marker 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.550
 sell as crochet markers 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.980
 but I recommend you 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.880
 ie I tell you do not need to 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.500
 use a marker of those that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.340
 buy you can use any kind of 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.770
 thing a clip or a pin we stick it in 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.780
 the first point and we already know where 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.780
 the round has started 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.950
 here would be the first point we should of 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.320
 give the whole loop that we go crochet 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.600
 the second in the second point of 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.690
 chain stitch 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.220
 once we have it we put the thread through 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.210
 behind 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.540
 above to drag by the first 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.940
 hole we remember about the first one a 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.540
 once we have the two loops we go back to 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.760
 pass the thread behind and ahead 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.710
 to drag the thread again by the 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.850
 first loop and the second 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.650
 having again the second point already 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.759
 we have the first and the second point 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.759
 we follow then for the third point 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:06.050
 Key to the crochet in the third point 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:08.840
 of chain and we passed in front of 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.389
 crochet yarn and we take it out just for 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.810
 the first club loop thus having the 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:18.139
 two loops we go through the thread again 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:22.570
 above the crochet and with the hook what 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.570
 so we drag the first loop 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.340
 but we do not drag it by the first 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.250
 loop and for the second loop 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:38.030
 doing so the third point as you can 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:40.410
 see we already have 1 2 and 3 low points 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.760
 let's finish the round I do it a little 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:47.850
 faster I nail in the fourth sack by 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.840
 the first step by the first and by the 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.780
 second 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.080
 another low point and the last one of this 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:01.580
 round in the last not the penultimate of 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.580
 this round I nail in the next sack 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.490
 and now for the two 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:12.370
 once again nail 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:16.229
 I went over it 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.229
 and then for the two 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.259
 we have already done the whole round because the 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:28.020
 next point would be the one we have in 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.020
 the pin forgiveness in the safety pin 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.200
 Well here is the low point to follow 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.200
 practicing
