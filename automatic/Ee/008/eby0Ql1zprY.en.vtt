really like this one I like having the
visor<00:00:39.879> and<00:00:40.440> surprisingly<00:00:41.440> it<00:00:41.620> doesn't<00:00:41.799> really

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
visor and surprisingly it doesn't really

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.229 
visor and surprisingly it doesn't really
catch<00:00:42.430> as<00:00:42.549> much<00:00:42.729> wind<00:00:42.940> as<00:00:43.089> you'd<00:00:43.210> think

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
catch as much wind as you'd think

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.610 
catch as much wind as you'd think
because<00:00:43.629> it<00:00:43.750> has<00:00:43.839> some<00:00:44.049> really<00:00:44.290> nice

channeling<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.930> channeling<00:00:47.320> also<00:00:47.589> leads<00:00:47.860> to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
channeling the channeling also leads to

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.450 
channeling the channeling also leads to
the<00:00:49.120> vents<00:00:49.449> right<00:00:50.260> up<00:00:50.409> here<00:00:50.710> which<00:00:51.190> aren't

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.289 
the vents right up here which aren't
that<00:00:51.580> big<00:00:51.850> but<00:00:52.089> they<00:00:52.180> surprisingly<00:00:52.600> do<00:00:53.229> a<00:00:53.260> lot

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
that big but they surprisingly do a lot

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.490

and<00:00:55.299> one<00:00:55.510> thing<00:00:55.720> that<00:00:55.869> I<00:00:55.900> really<00:00:56.170> like<00:00:56.350> about

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.200 
and one thing that I really like about
it<00:00:56.650> is<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:56.979> the<00:00:57.790> vents<00:00:58.000> are<00:00:58.119> easy<00:00:58.299> to<00:00:58.479> find

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it is that the vents are easy to find
