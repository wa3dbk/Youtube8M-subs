electric power steering now this
steering<00:01:14.490> feel<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:15.570> expect

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
steering feel is what you would expect

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
steering feel is what you would expect
from<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.229> Volkswagen<00:01:16.890> nice<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> planted

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
from a Volkswagen nice and planted

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
from a Volkswagen nice and planted
especially<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.720> higher<00:01:18.900> speeds<00:01:19.320> brakes<00:01:19.830> are

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
especially at higher speeds brakes are

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.980 
especially at higher speeds brakes are
fantastic<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.390> everything<00:01:21.720> you've<00:01:21.840> come

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
fantastic so it's everything you've come

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.739 
fantastic so it's everything you've come
to<00:01:22.110> expect<00:01:22.229> from<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.860> GTI<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
to expect from a GTI a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.459 
to expect from a GTI a
performance-oriented<00:01:24.749> car<00:01:25.229> with

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
performance-oriented car with

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.529 
performance-oriented car with
independent<00:01:26.009> suspension<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.759> good<00:01:27.240> power

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
independent suspension and good power

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.450 
independent suspension and good power
but<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.350> grown<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.039> be<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.429> more

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
but now it's grown up to be much more

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:59.480 
but now it's grown up to be much more
sophisticated

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.430 

so<00:02:00.490> here<00:02:00.730> are<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.850> details<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.660> new<00:02:01.870> GTI

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
so here are the details on the new GTI

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.150 
so here are the details on the new GTI
it<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.520> bigger<00:02:03.940> but<00:02:04.300> it's<00:02:04.450> also<00:02:04.600> 42<00:02:05.350> kilograms

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
it is bigger but it's also 42 kilograms

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.490 
it is bigger but it's also 42 kilograms
lighter<00:02:06.700> they<00:02:07.240> use<00:02:07.450> more<00:02:07.750> high<00:02:08.020> strength

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
lighter they use more high strength

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.010 
lighter they use more high strength
tensile<00:02:08.740> steel<00:02:09.369> which<00:02:09.850> means<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.330> body<00:02:10.539> more

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
tensile steel which means the body more

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.330 
tensile steel which means the body more
rigid<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.860> gives<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> more

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
rigid that gives you a more

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.310 
rigid that gives you a more
sophisticated<00:02:12.720> platform<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:13.870> addition<00:02:14.230> the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
sophisticated platform in addition the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.680 
sophisticated platform in addition the
wheelbase<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.800> longer<00:02:15.400> then<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:16.030> add<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
wheelbase is longer then you add in a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.900 
wheelbase is longer then you add in a
direct<00:02:17.410> injection<00:02:17.800> turbocharged<00:02:18.550> two-liter

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
direct injection turbocharged two-liter

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.050 
direct injection turbocharged two-liter
