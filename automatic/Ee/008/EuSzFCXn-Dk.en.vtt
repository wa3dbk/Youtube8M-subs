00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
that and i like demons as well i think

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.480 
that and i like demons as well i think
that's<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.840> really<00:01:47.080> strong<00:01:47.320> song<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.920> i<00:01:48.250> think

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
that's a really strong song and i think

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.670 
that's a really strong song and i think
that<00:01:49.420> then<00:01:49.540> kind<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.780> songs<00:01:49.960> carry<00:01:50.290> on<00:01:50.470> through

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
that then kind of songs carry on through

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.770 
that then kind of songs carry on through
the<00:01:50.799> album<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.430> think<00:01:51.909> there<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.090> darker<00:01:52.570> songs

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the album I think there is darker songs

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.690 
the album I think there is darker songs
and<00:01:52.990> album<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.470> dark<00:01:53.680> themes<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.369> lyrics

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
and album and dark themes and lyrics

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.910 
and album and dark themes and lyrics
like<00:01:55.299> especially<00:01:55.689> on<00:01:55.990> bleeding<00:01:56.439> out<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.799> song

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
like especially on bleeding out and song

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.440 
like especially on bleeding out and song
further<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.460> think<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.880> bit<00:01:58.000> more<00:01:58.150> raw

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
further and I think it's a bit more raw

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.480 
further and I think it's a bit more raw
and<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:59.110> bit<00:01:59.229> more<00:01:59.409> emotional<00:01:59.710> but<00:02:00.189> I<00:02:00.220> don't

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
and a bit more emotional but I don't

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.890 
and a bit more emotional but I don't
think<00:02:00.670> that's<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.090> intention<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.659> often

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
think that's that intention it often

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.280 
think that's that intention it often
trying<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.260> be<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.530> really<00:02:03.060> thought-provoking

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
trying to be a really thought-provoking

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.170 
trying to be a really thought-provoking
emotional<00:02:05.430> artists<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.520> just<00:02:06.759> trying<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.060> be

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
emotional artists that just trying to be

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.859 
emotional artists that just trying to be
I<00:02:07.420> think<00:02:07.750> for<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.500> bit<00:02:08.769> more<00:02:09.569> different<00:02:10.569> Rock

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
I think for a bit more different Rock

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.089 
I think for a bit more different Rock
than<00:02:11.110> what<00:02:11.200> we've<00:02:11.319> heard<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.680> there<00:02:11.799> is<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> lot

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
than what we've heard and there is a lot

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.559 
than what we've heard and there is a lot
of<00:02:12.129> these<00:02:12.280> bands<00:02:12.549> going<00:02:12.819> about<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.209> moment

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
of these bands going about the moment

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.069 
of these bands going about the moment
which<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:14.189> what<00:02:15.189> these<00:02:15.400> aren't<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.389> luckily

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
which is what these aren't but luckily

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.000 
which is what these aren't but luckily
what<00:02:18.040> imagine<00:02:18.459> dragons<00:02:18.790> do<00:02:18.969> have<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.209> something

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
what imagine dragons do have a something

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.880 
what imagine dragons do have a something
which<00:02:20.280> separates<00:02:21.090> them<00:02:21.330> from<00:02:21.360> other<00:02:22.349> bands

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
which separates them from other bands

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.850 
which separates them from other bands
like<00:02:23.129> bastille<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.819> well<00:02:24.659> like<00:02:25.049> one<00:02:25.290> republic

booked in a way we do I don't like

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.240 
booked in a way we do I don't like
because<00:04:51.590> they<00:04:52.590> brought<00:04:52.889> something<00:04:53.220> different

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
because they brought something different

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.619 
because they brought something different
to<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.610> table<00:04:53.669> they've<00:04:54.090> been<00:04:54.210> clever<00:04:54.479> about

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
to the table they've been clever about

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:55.850 
to the table they've been clever about
it<00:04:54.750> they're<00:04:54.960> not<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.199> making<00:04:55.680> me<00:04:55.830> a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
it they're not just making me a

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.860 
it they're not just making me a
meaningless<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.819> music<00:04:57.210> which<00:04:57.509> means

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
meaningless and music which means

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.480 
meaningless and music which means
nothing<00:04:58.259> they're<00:04:58.710> bringing<00:04:59.009> something<00:04:59.340> to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
nothing they're bringing something to

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.830 
nothing they're bringing something to
the<00:04:59.610> table<00:04:59.699> or<00:05:00.060> something<00:05:00.090> which<00:05:00.509> people<00:05:00.810> are

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
the table or something which people are

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.119 
the table or something which people are
actually<00:05:01.020> going<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:01.379> wrote<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.680> their<00:05:01.770> pockets

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
actually going to wrote in their pockets

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.430 
actually going to wrote in their pockets
and<00:05:02.250> by<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.879> I<00:05:03.090> think<00:05:03.300> something<00:05:04.080> which<00:05:04.199> i

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
and by and I think something which i

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.439 
and by and I think something which i
would<00:05:04.500> definitely<00:05:05.400> invested<00:05:05.970> in<00:05:06.060> I'm

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
would definitely invested in I'm

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.450 
would definitely invested in I'm
definitely<00:05:06.659> excited<00:05:07.050> said<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:08.009> was<00:05:08.159> coming

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
definitely excited said it was coming

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.790 
definitely excited said it was coming
next<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.759> I<00:05:08.849> think<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:10.560> kind<00:05:10.770> of

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
next and I think that that the kind of

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.469 
next and I think that that the kind of
like<00:05:10.979> atmospheric<00:05:11.699> sound<00:05:11.970> like<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.180> said<00:05:12.360> it's

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
like atmospheric sound like I said it's

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.120 
like atmospheric sound like I said it's
kind<00:05:12.599> of<00:05:12.720> like<00:05:12.840> it's<00:05:13.409> not<00:05:13.590> maybe<00:05:13.800> as<00:05:13.949> much

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
kind of like it's not maybe as much

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.010 
kind of like it's not maybe as much
emotional<00:05:14.729> as<00:05:14.849> the<00:05:15.180> one<00:05:15.330> republic<00:05:15.720> our<00:05:15.840> bond

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
emotional as the one republic our bond

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.420 
emotional as the one republic our bond
which<00:05:16.139> I<00:05:16.229> did<00:05:16.409> previously<00:05:17.190> or<00:05:17.639> like<00:05:17.849> is<00:05:19.430> always

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
which I did previously or like is always

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.180 
which I did previously or like is always
original<00:05:21.030> is<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:22.080> Bastille<00:05:22.469> album<00:05:22.860> which<00:05:23.039> is

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
original is the Bastille album which is

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.620 
original is the Bastille album which is
going<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.490> or<00:05:23.699> like<00:05:23.940> as<00:05:24.120> colorful<00:05:24.539> as

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
going on or like as colorful as

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.070 
going on or like as colorful as
Coldplay's<00:05:25.259> albums<00:05:25.710> it's<00:05:26.370> kind<00:05:26.639> of<00:05:26.699> like<00:05:27.080> it's

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
Coldplay's albums it's kind of like it's

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.450 
Coldplay's albums it's kind of like it's
kind<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.409> like<00:05:28.500> different<00:05:28.949> completely<00:05:29.190> I

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
kind of like different completely I

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.520 
kind of like different completely I
think<00:05:29.639> it's<00:05:29.759> dark<00:05:30.000> about<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.389> same<00:05:30.569> time<00:05:30.719> it's

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
think it's dark about the same time it's

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.529 
think it's dark about the same time it's
hopeful<00:05:32.099> and<00:05:32.610> it's<00:05:32.729> kind<00:05:32.879> of<00:05:32.909> called<00:05:33.120> beat<00:05:33.330> and

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
hopeful and it's kind of called beat and

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.390 
hopeful and it's kind of called beat and
at<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.840> same<00:05:33.990> time<00:05:34.050> it's<00:05:34.319> it's<00:05:34.889> not<00:05:35.159> to<00:05:35.280> be

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
at the same time it's it's not to be

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.309 
at the same time it's it's not to be
taken<00:05:35.430> too<00:05:35.849> seriously<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.599> that's<00:05:37.080> what<00:05:37.289> I

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
taken too seriously and that's what I

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.499 
taken too seriously and that's what I
think<00:05:37.560> it's<00:05:37.889> just<00:05:38.159> gone<00:05:38.340> it's<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.330> really

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
think it's just gone it's a really

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:40.760 
think it's just gone it's a really
enjoyable<00:05:39.750> album<00:05:40.289> I've<00:05:40.469> definitely

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
enjoyable album I've definitely

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.260 
enjoyable album I've definitely
recommend<00:05:41.370> getting<00:05:41.490> in<00:05:41.699> my<00:05:41.789> highlights<00:05:42.150> for

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
recommend getting in my highlights for

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.899 
recommend getting in my highlights for
me<00:05:42.330> a<00:05:42.419> radioactive<00:05:43.139> it's<00:05:43.409> x<00:05:43.740> demon<00:05:44.370> on<00:05:44.520> top<00:05:44.759> of

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
me a radioactive it's x demon on top of

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.850 
me a radioactive it's x demon on top of
the<00:05:44.969> world<00:05:45.120> underdog<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:46.199> nothing<00:05:46.560> enough<00:05:46.710> to

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
the world underdog and nothing enough to

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.730 
the world underdog and nothing enough to
say<00:05:47.039> I'm<00:05:47.340> rocks<00:05:47.669> and<00:05:48.509> all<00:05:48.659> fantastic<00:05:49.139> songs<00:05:49.590> on

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
say I'm rocks and all fantastic songs on

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.050 
say I'm rocks and all fantastic songs on
the<00:05:49.830> album<00:05:49.860> but<00:05:50.219> they're<00:05:50.370> my<00:05:50.490> highlights<00:05:50.880> and

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the album but they're my highlights and

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.430 
the album but they're my highlights and
I<00:05:51.120> really<00:05:51.360> like<00:05:51.509> the<00:05:51.630> way<00:05:51.659> the<00:05:51.900> uplands<00:05:52.259> put

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
I really like the way the uplands put

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.930 
I really like the way the uplands put
together<00:05:52.740> because<00:05:52.919> every<00:05:53.490> song<00:05:53.669> is<00:05:53.909> a

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
together because every song is a

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.120 
together because every song is a
potential<00:05:54.449> here<00:05:54.690> on<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.259> oven<00:05:55.440> like<00:05:55.860> I'm<00:05:56.039> I

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
potential here on the oven like I'm I

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.320 
potential here on the oven like I'm I
don't<00:05:56.340> really<00:05:56.430> care<00:05:56.639> about<00:05:56.729> hits<00:05:57.029> career

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
don't really care about hits career

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.570 
don't really care about hits career
because<00:05:57.539> I<00:05:57.569> think<00:05:57.719> that<00:05:57.900> if<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:58.949> song<00:05:59.130> gets<00:05:59.159> to

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
because I think that if a song gets to

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.070 
because I think that if a song gets to
the<00:05:59.699> top<00:05:59.819> of<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.090> job<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:00.509> what<00:06:00.719> doesn't<00:06:01.020> make

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
the top of the job so what doesn't make

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.600 
the top of the job so what doesn't make
it<00:06:01.229> a<00:06:01.440> better<00:06:01.710> song<00:06:01.979> than<00:06:02.009> the<00:06:02.250> rest<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.520> the

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
it a better song than the rest of the

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.140 
it a better song than the rest of the
songs<00:06:02.789> but<00:06:03.380> it<00:06:04.380> really<00:06:04.919> are<00:06:05.099> hits<00:06:05.310> you<00:06:05.490> have<00:06:05.819> so

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
songs but it really are hits you have so

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.850 
songs but it really are hits you have so
much<00:06:06.210> potential<00:06:06.779> and<00:06:07.199> I<00:06:07.319> think<00:06:07.500> much<00:06:07.710> in

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
much potential and I think much in

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.620 
much potential and I think much in
drukker's<00:06:08.009> are<00:06:08.250> so<00:06:08.520> much<00:06:08.639> potential<00:06:09.029> to<00:06:09.180> do<00:06:09.360> so

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
drukker's are so much potential to do so

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.290 
drukker's are so much potential to do so
