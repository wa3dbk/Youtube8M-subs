00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 I wish you all the best, Artem 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.930
 complemented by previous no lesson on 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.240
 optimizing the mane he is how you see 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.580
 I am now leaving the full group until 6 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 man plus i i'm not standing i'm 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.179
 specifically chose to have an extra person 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 did not display here to me anymore 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.730
 places were here see in general that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.289
 the moment I said yes that is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.760
 to highlight accordingly 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.140
 instantly its so spoiled 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 watch me do this i 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.320
 I run just run plus me on these 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.000
 buttons worth highlighting 4 first sparta 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.590
 cypher and last paid a little bit 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.890
 another command because you are under siege 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.890
 four buttons we need 5 here look 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:52.110
 see instantly highlighting 4 first 5 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 now we run do not shout at 4 podhilit about 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.789
 I'm all on it , I see that I need 1 to 3 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.520
 liters on it I see that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.439
 weed it is necessary to file windows on it like 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 I would move a little but at the same time 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.760
 I see at any moment highlighting that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:19.740
 whom i need is very comfortable then very 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.080
 useful for healers here and don't forget 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.530
 in front of me right now I'm running 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.820
 Iâ€™ll run accordingly will be semi spelled and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 necessarily 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 besides what you highlight you need 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.740
 to build in the table how approximately will be 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.860
 attack attack we will have so a couple 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.009
 will kill sorca 2 will kill 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 archer accordingly you for this 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.979
 you need to build them so that you are comfortable 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.140
 it was instant to get to them because 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.090
 that for example, 6 is not very me 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.090
 convenient here 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:05.970
 I find it easier to pick from 3 1 2 2 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:09.429
 very uncomfortable being paid here 1 3 4 5 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.569
 how would i stand out without problems 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.920
 so where are you no longer ran there and 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 accordingly , you should build 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.989
 the chain is generally like this 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.370
 we were in the drive 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.830
 probably even better like this because 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.709
 Romney is heavier than 3 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.019
 so don't forget to stay away from 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.900
 the table 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.610
 since you would be more comfortable and heal 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.130
 accordingly, the weakest here 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.630
 armor this here 40 and their archer 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.970
 accordingly will kill himself first 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.580
 first of all therefore you must op 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.340
 on them constantly be able to instantly 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.620
 then everything will be fine but 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.600
 In our case, the vision is unique. 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.110
 cleric ie we may have problems 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.459
 of course because he is of course Hiller 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.959
 not such a cleric here, but I added everything 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.959
 previous lesson thank you for your attention
