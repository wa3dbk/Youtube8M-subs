in<00:00:38.899> other<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.170> been<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> while<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.860> xbox<00:00:41.790> or

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
in other it's been a while on xbox or

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.299 
in other it's been a while on xbox or
playstation<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.559> matter<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
playstation for that matter when it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
playstation for that matter when it
comes<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> console<00:00:44.940> shooters<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.420> seems<00:00:45.660> like

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
comes to console shooters it seems like

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.040 
comes to console shooters it seems like
everything<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.559> pretty<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.219> hot<00:00:47.670> garbage

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
everything is pretty much hot garbage

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
everything is pretty much hot garbage
and<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.289> putting<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.620> lightly<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.250> think

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and that's putting it lightly I think

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
and that's putting it lightly I think
black<00:00:51.000> ops<00:00:51.210> 2<00:00:51.390> did<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.690> pretty<00:00:51.960> well<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:53.010> its

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
black ops 2 did it pretty well with its

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
black ops 2 did it pretty well with its
league<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.390> divisions<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.110> can't<00:00:55.320> remember

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
league or divisions I can't remember

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.110 
league or divisions I can't remember
what<00:00:55.710> exactly<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.309> called<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:56.969> had

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
what exactly it was called when they had

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
what exactly it was called when they had
the<00:00:57.300> basically<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> same<00:00:58.140> system<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> halo

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the basically the same system that halo

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.180 
the basically the same system that halo
is<00:00:59.039> using<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> outside<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.199> when<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
is using but outside of that when you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.690 
is using but outside of that when you
talk<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.670> regular<00:01:03.000> social<00:01:03.510> playlist<00:01:04.290> or

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
talk about a regular social playlist or

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
talk about a regular social playlist or
if<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:06.090> wasn't<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> league<00:01:06.720> playlist<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.500> for

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
if there wasn't a league playlist of for

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.109 
if there wasn't a league playlist of for
black<00:01:07.979> ops<00:01:08.010> 2<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> talk<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
black ops 2 if you talk about some of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.910 
black ops 2 if you talk about some of
the<00:01:09.240> previous<00:01:09.420> Call<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> Duty's<00:01:10.110> matchmaking

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the previous Call of Duty's matchmaking

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.399 
the previous Call of Duty's matchmaking
has<00:01:11.189> traditionally<00:01:11.700> been<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.750> bad<00:01:13.049> as

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
has traditionally been very very bad as

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
has traditionally been very very bad as
since<00:01:13.650> maybe<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.220> halo<00:01:14.640> 2<00:01:14.700> might<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.689> been

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
since maybe like halo 2 might have been

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620 
since maybe like halo 2 might have been
the<00:01:15.869> best<00:01:16.320> matchmaking<00:01:16.830> we've<00:01:17.130> gotten<00:01:17.630> ever

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the best matchmaking we've gotten ever

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080 
the best matchmaking we've gotten ever
on<00:01:19.140> console<00:01:20.100> games<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> look<00:01:20.970> at

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on console games and you look at

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.910 
on console games and you look at
everything<00:01:21.299> else<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.750> they've<00:01:21.900> been<00:01:22.080> pretty

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
everything else and they've been pretty

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.789 
everything else and they've been pretty
dang<00:01:23.250> gone<00:01:23.400> bad<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> trueskill<00:01:24.210> system<00:01:24.799> we

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
dang gone bad the trueskill system we

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.100 
dang gone bad the trueskill system we
have<00:01:26.009> seen<00:01:26.280> time<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.759> time<00:01:26.820> again<00:01:26.970> has<00:01:27.630> failed

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
have seen time and time again has failed

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.340 
have seen time and time again has failed
horribly<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:30.680> xbox<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> feel

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
horribly on xbox and you know I feel

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.730 
horribly on xbox and you know I feel
like<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.860> system<00:01:35.460> gets<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.750> not

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
like this system gets it right a lot not

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.499 
like this system gets it right a lot not
all<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.070> time<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.700> perfect<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
all the time it's not perfect it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
all the time it's not perfect it
definitely<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:40.530> help<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:41.009> players<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
definitely doesn't help out players that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
definitely doesn't help out players that
are<00:01:41.729> playing<00:01:41.939> solo<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.869> feel<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.680> this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
are playing solo I feel like this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.090 
are playing solo I feel like this
probably<00:01:44.210> encourages<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.960> team<00:01:46.829> play

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
probably encourages a lot of team play

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.240 
probably encourages a lot of team play
so<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.119> wouldn't<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.540> surprised<00:01:49.020> when<00:01:49.770> if

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
so I wouldn't be surprised when if

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
so I wouldn't be surprised when if
you're<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.520> already<00:01:50.729> experiencing<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> when

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you're not already experiencing is when

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
you're not already experiencing is when
the<00:01:52.110> full<00:01:52.290> game<00:01:52.470> comes<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:53.909> see<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the full game comes out you will see the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.639 
the full game comes out you will see the
party<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> four<00:01:54.990> trihard<00:01:55.649> players<00:01:56.149> going<00:01:57.149> down

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
party of four trihard players going down

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.800 
party of four trihard players going down

that's supposed to be how the system

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.590 
that's supposed to be how the system
works<00:03:20.640> kind<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.000> has<00:03:21.090> some<00:03:21.240> checks<00:03:21.450> and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
works kind of has some checks and

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.390 
works kind of has some checks and
balances<00:03:21.960> based<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> quality<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.100> the
