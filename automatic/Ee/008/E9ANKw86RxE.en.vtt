on<00:01:26.050> training<00:01:26.530> puppies<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.910> I<00:01:27.940> decided<00:01:28.510> to<00:01:28.990> take

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
on training puppies so I decided to take

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.370 
on training puppies so I decided to take
them<00:01:29.530> out<00:01:29.680> for<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.979> run<00:01:30.100> today<00:01:30.420> put<00:01:31.420> them<00:01:31.630> back

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
because that's who they're used to

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.500 
because that's who they're used to
running<00:01:37.960> with<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.640> they<00:01:39.880> needed<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.270> little

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510
