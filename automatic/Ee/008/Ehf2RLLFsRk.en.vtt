00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello people it's just the weather 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.980
 That's why I can go to Berlin today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.370
 not on the roof again but I wanted 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.929
 make a video and cook at the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.340
 differentiated what I should do 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.690
 very many more injured cook 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.070
 video written but make something with 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 pizza how to make your own pizza and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.730
 In fact, I always wonder why 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
 we always have to eat frozen pizzas 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.939
 then a pizza dough that is so fast 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.590
 And most of all, you always have it done 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.240
 everything in the house and eventually put it on 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 you can actually have and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.269
 That's why I'm doing a video today 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.150
 on the topic how do I make a pizza 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.619
 even for the dough of ourselves 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.200
 made pizza need like olive oil 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.940
 lukewarm water flour about a home 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.290
 tablespoon sugar fresh yeast back 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 should you not have these then go 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.879
 also dry yeast and about 1 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.140
 teaspoon salt is supposed to be a test 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.969
 we need pizza werner for this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 Passed tomatoes as cheese namely one 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.920
 Mixture of organic mozzarella tem thaler 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.590
 prosciutto so ham and as fungi 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879
 So mushrooms namely fresh mushrooms 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.170
 first comes to the dough has to choose 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.940
 Put the flour in a bowl approximately 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 200 grams I have here it is something 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.539
 more or less not so bad 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.309
 that could do after one depending on 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.920
 how to have the consistency of the day 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 then about half a tablespoon 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 sugar and a pinch or half 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.159
 to a teaspoon salt to the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 lukewarm water it is important that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.720
 lukewarm is about 110 milliliters 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 because it reacts very well afterwards 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.960
 the yeast and then a tablespoon 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.460
 olive oil action from the fresh 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.080
 we take about one baguettes 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.689
 half dice and that's important 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.430
 that we are really small little ones 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.140
 disperse pieces and over the dough 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.400
 give and distribute well there else 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.619
 we'll have it all up later 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.329
 a stain and that is the new beginning 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.979
 with hands to knead we mix the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.810
 whole with a fork is called intersection 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.820
 very sticky at the beginning and if you like that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 you can do the worst 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 really take the hand then it says 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.119
 56 minutes kneading kneading until 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 the dough about something that is fluffy 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.110
 But it must now at room temperature 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.670
 30 minutes away if best 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.409
 with a towel or with a towel 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.360
 kitchen towel about it really for 30 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.640
 put minutes aside and grabs you 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.920
 best time 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.840
 Ryan dunn I always oversleep that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 best as I do this 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.140
 all right therefore, 30 minutes time since 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.250
 we can us a little about the other 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.680
 take care of the ingredients 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.420
 emmentaler and rhyme slightly longer and 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.190
 slightly smaller stripes are the smaller ones 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.650
 stick together and are so nice afterwards 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.570
 on the plaque great little crisis club 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.400
 If we have done that we will come too 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.140
 it is important to the mushrooms 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520
 that you wash them off beforehand but 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.850
 not too much why because the suck 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.020
 the water is incredible on it then 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.310
 345 small fast depending on how many 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.130
 Write what you want to have then 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.390
 we continue our ingredients so on 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.100
 prepared and then it is waiting 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.540
 wait wait until half past hour 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.760
 is over but that is now with me 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.269
 hopefully the ultimate now 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.280
 case 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.860
 and then when your timer runs to the end 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.780
 that can really look that is absolutely 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.610
 Play has a lot of air and volume 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.019
 then we take care of an area 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.790
 with more we want the tiger now 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.980
 roll out and then it really means 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.290
 much patience for this day is 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.480
 roll very elastic roll and roll 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.200
 after a few minutes should be about so 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.000
 appearance 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.980
 next to it as a bit of baking paper 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.300
 our dough on it and then you can 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.590
 We start with the rubbers 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.360
 with the baking paper already 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.220
 the whole thing after that appeared in the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.540
 bake oven and now it is still 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.010
 just when the coating on it first 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.510
 it would be a bit more difficult than covering 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.459
 Of course we start with the primer 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.870
 with passed tomatoes to those with one 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.519
 Spread the spoon well and go too 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.560
 really everything on the edge 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.150
 it is not covered afterwards 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.790
 very crisp frost and we do not want 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.190
 give too much edge then a little 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.900
 little crisis under the sauce and the or 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.940
 under the ham and under the mushrooms 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.380
 make as is on the ham on it 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.120
 just like the mushrooms and makes 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.890
 Overall, not too much on it 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.660
 otherwise the pizza can not be neat 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.700
 by beaten I exaggerate it here already 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.560
 almost but somehow I felt like it 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.930
 after we have ham and mushrooms 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.610
 on the pizza party day comes one more 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.890
 neat portion of cheese on it and then 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.110
 as icing on the cake many small pieces 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.670
 Demolished mozzarella nation is done 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.380
 It's easy now, too 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.459
 just a pizza plate and let 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.780
 the whole company sees these 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.579
 not wave motion out of it 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.890
 I think it's great the whole thing must be 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.780
 oven at 200 degrees best preheated 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.519
 or you something in this 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.810
 range for ten minutes and after ten 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.160
 minutes are the pizza really 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.170
 great and cool if now 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.940
 then you do not care about anything 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.500
 he does not just look good he leaves that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.000
 whole and even more delicious 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.200
 tastes wonderful with a 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.030
 small note in front 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.800
 I think it's delicious hope one or 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.420
 other desire gets all the way to 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.280
 make and wish you bon appÃ©tit 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.950
 Here she is, she does not look beautiful 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.000
 out of friends so in this cursory 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.590
 almost as a bit like that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.290
 American she pie it all hot and fresh 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.030
 out of the oven and she smells thanks 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.020
 delicious I love my funk the thing that 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.730
 has not been for two three weeks 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.240
 control I get it may not 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.890
 eat 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.360
 at most one piece but even and and 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.820
 lets in front of the camera to try it is 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.080
 too hot for me and that is a great pity 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.580
 which I do not always understand by the way 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.320
 in pizza one really eats almost 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.540
 everything at home you have more you have oil 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.620
 salt sugar dry yeast has you on 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.330
 every case actually at home water 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.070
 Anyway, I can partake of you 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.900
 Do it yourself and it tastes so much 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.340
 better the genforschung open on and 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.860
 does not need to bake for a long time and that 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.590
 crackles and it is crispy on every corner 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.120
 and the end one waits for now 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.590
 you have it just belongs to him only as 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.300
 it is wonderful to push a little 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.320
 horny and I am annoyed that I even 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.640
 I can not eat but I will 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.680
 immediately pass on to the man of 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.940
 immediately comes to visit and will be 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.350
 of course, certainly pleased when 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.270
 really delicious pizza I have 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.890
 going to watch out that is eaten 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.220
 what I did myself very much 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.080
 a lot of 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.730
 ok i hope you make the pizza 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.770
 maybe after and maybe animated 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.300
 animated times at home a pizza to 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.890
 let me take pictures or video 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.080
 answer so that we do that I think 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.060
 really good that a lot of the zucchini 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.350
 pasta has many have 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.330
 the japanese we made it from the 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.820
 bake all the way and knead fully 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.560
 warm and I would probably like it 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.700
 enjoy the same piece and that will be fine 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.190
 true says goodbye and the same again 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.930
 this wonderful copy of what it has 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.940
 Therefore in the sharpness what the hell 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.380
 wonderful day will follow your heart 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.520
 I do not care what else 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.980
 that was a good inspiration 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.150
 Last time a good idea with the pizza 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.680
 dig I wish you one more 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.630
 wonderful day we see ourselves completely 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.780
 soon follow your heart again 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.190
 that's the most important thing and think if 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.290
 The next time a piece of pizza is on 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.930
 I was a bit pity that I 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.970
 she does not eat it makes it good that 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.970
 very soon and bye
