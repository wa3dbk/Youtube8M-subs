00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
California I got one of these accepted

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.030 
California I got one of these accepted
cost<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:15.240> $10<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> believe<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.920> was

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
cost over $10 I believe and this one was

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.030 
cost over $10 I believe and this one was
only<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> dollar<00:01:17.820> -<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.530> very

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
only like a dollar - so it's very very

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980 
only like a dollar - so it's very very
inexpensive<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:21.060> assuming<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.659> black

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
inexpensive I'm assuming this black

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.160 
inexpensive I'm assuming this black
piece<00:01:22.380> probably<00:01:23.189> goes<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.970> back<00:01:24.240> but

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
piece probably goes on the back but

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
piece probably goes on the back but
because<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.470> make<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> struggle<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
because I make a struggle out of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.260 
because I make a struggle out of
everything<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.990> confusing<00:01:28.590> myself<00:01:29.270> I'm

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
everything I'm like confusing myself I'm

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.399 
everything I'm like confusing myself I'm
doing<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.640> there<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:34.200> that's

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
doing this right there we go so that's

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.789 
doing this right there we go so that's
how<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.770> looks<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.390> simple<00:01:36.930> gold

carry a big purse but I can slide some

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.800 
carry a big purse but I can slide some
money<00:02:24.280> under<00:02:24.490> here<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.090> could<00:02:25.270> put<00:02:25.420> my<00:02:25.570> ID

and my debit card or whatever so yeah I

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.900 
and my debit card or whatever so yeah I
thought<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.470> was<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> pretty<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.070> idea<00:02:30.130> and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
thought this was a pretty good idea and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.190 
thought this was a pretty good idea and
when<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.060> saw<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.330> on<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.510> website<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.959> thought

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
when I saw it on the website I thought

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.960 
when I saw it on the website I thought
it<00:02:32.320> was<00:02:32.410> give<00:02:32.560> me<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.770> gritty<00:02:33.100> glitter<00:02:33.670> type

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
it was give me that gritty glitter type

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.750 
it was give me that gritty glitter type
and<00:02:34.270> I'm<00:02:34.630> glad<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.290> say<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.010> not<00:02:36.250> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
and I'm glad to say that it is not the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.390 
and I'm glad to say that it is not the
glitter<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.239> actually<00:02:37.780> inside<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.010> case<00:02:39.190> if

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
glitter is actually inside the case if

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.350 
glitter is actually inside the case if
that<00:02:39.430> makes<00:02:39.670> any<00:02:39.730> sense<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:40.239> probably

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
that makes any sense so they probably

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.970 
that makes any sense so they probably
put<00:02:40.690> some<00:02:40.840> kind<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.050> gloss<00:02:41.320> on<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:41.920> you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
put some kind of gloss on there so you

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.710 
put some kind of gloss on there so you
don't<00:02:42.190> have<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.520> worry<00:02:42.700> about<00:02:42.850> scratching<00:02:43.330> it

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
don't have to worry about scratching it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.960 
don't have to worry about scratching it
and<00:02:43.900> messing<00:02:44.500> up<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.739> glitter<00:02:45.130> or<00:02:45.459> any

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
and messing up the glitter or any

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.479 
and messing up the glitter or any
