Shauna<00:01:01.949> Deepika<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:03.180> he<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.409> his<00:01:04.589> own

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
Shauna Deepika I think he was on his own

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.530 
Shauna Deepika I think he was on his own
and<00:01:05.189> he's<00:01:05.580> probably<00:01:05.820> realized<00:01:06.240> he's<00:01:06.510> not

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and he's probably realized he's not

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.740 
and he's probably realized he's not
getting<00:01:07.110> lucky<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.380> boyhood<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.570> maybe<00:01:09.570> he

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
getting lucky with boyhood so maybe he

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
getting lucky with boyhood so maybe he
came<00:01:09.930> there<00:01:10.110> looking<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.590> me<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> work<00:01:11.100> there

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.710 
came there looking for me to work there
was<00:01:11.880> nobody<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.330> him

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
was nobody with him

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
was nobody with him
and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.950> think<00:01:14.369> another<00:01:14.490> thing<00:01:14.610> he<00:01:14.850> probably

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and I think another thing he probably

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.740 
and I think another thing he probably
got<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.770> camera<00:01:16.770> conscious<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:18.119> he<00:01:18.630> was

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
got very camera conscious because he was

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.240 
got very camera conscious because he was
probably<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.200> expecting<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> media<00:01:20.040> there

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
probably not expecting the media there

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.670 
probably not expecting the media there
and<00:01:20.460> he<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.509> upset<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> trying<00:01:22.560> to
