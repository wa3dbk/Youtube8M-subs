00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.689 
definitely the carbon fiber on the shoe
makes<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> very<00:01:01.050> uncomfortable<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:02.070> first<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
makes it very uncomfortable at first it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.770

I've<00:01:56.369> seen<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.759> there<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.329> said<00:01:57.570> before

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
I've seen out there like I said before

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.429 
I've seen out there like I said before
first<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> all<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> got<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.460> fly<00:01:59.670> wire<00:02:00.439> right

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
first of all you got you fly wire right

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.069 
first of all you got you fly wire right
there<00:02:02.189> not<00:02:02.520> sure<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.270> well

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
there not sure if you can see that well

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.830 
there not sure if you can see that well
that's<00:02:04.350> implemented<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> boot<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.840> kind

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
that's implemented into the boot to kind

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
that's implemented into the boot to kind
of<00:02:06.930> stabilize<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.950> also<00:02:08.520> make<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.789> very

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
of stabilize it and also make it very

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.809 
of stabilize it and also make it very
lightweight<00:02:09.410> which<00:02:10.410> lightweight<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.489> also

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
lightweight which lightweight is also

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.000 
lightweight which lightweight is also
the<00:02:11.940> main<00:02:12.060> goal<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.780> carbon<00:02:13.080> fiber

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the main goal of the carbon fiber

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.009 
the main goal of the carbon fiber
another<00:02:14.310> technological<00:02:14.849> improvement<00:02:15.720> that

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
another technological improvement that

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.420 
another technological improvement that
hasn't<00:02:16.409> been<00:02:16.439> seen<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.129> many<00:02:17.310> other

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
hasn't been seen really on many other

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.819 
hasn't been seen really on many other
boots<00:02:17.760> other<00:02:18.360> than<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.780> Puma<00:02:19.200> i<00:02:19.379> believe<00:02:19.680> i

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
boots other than the Puma i believe i

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.500 
boots other than the Puma i believe i
believe<00:02:19.950> Puma<00:02:20.370> has<00:02:20.519> carbon<00:02:20.939> fiber<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.390> some

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
believe Puma has carbon fiber and some

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.679 
believe Puma has carbon fiber and some
of<00:02:21.599> their<00:02:21.689> boots<00:02:21.950> um<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.879> then<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.510> got

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
of their boots um but and then you got

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.350 
of their boots um but and then you got
this<00:02:24.870> little<00:02:25.290> since<00:02:25.739> stud<00:02:26.069> here<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.610> don't

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
this little since stud here I don't

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.860 
this little since stud here I don't
really<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.599> this<00:02:27.959> thing<00:02:28.849> seems<00:02:29.849> corny<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
really like this thing seems corny and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.850 
really like this thing seems corny and
tacky<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.709> me<00:02:31.739> it's<00:02:32.730> supposed<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.360> uh<00:02:34.159> I<00:02:35.159> guess

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
tacky to me it's supposed to uh I guess

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.229 
tacky to me it's supposed to uh I guess
recognize<00:02:37.860> when<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> grounds<00:02:38.730> wet<00:02:38.970> and

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
recognize when the grounds wet and

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.960 
recognize when the grounds wet and
extend<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.590> make<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.890> into<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.190> soft<00:02:41.640> ground

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
extend to make it into a soft ground

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.479 
extend to make it into a soft ground
stud<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:42.659> mean<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.439> can't<00:02:43.709> really<00:02:43.829> be<00:02:43.920> tested

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
stud I mean that can't really be tested

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.890 
stud I mean that can't really be tested
so<00:02:44.609> I<00:02:44.670> can't<00:02:44.909> really<00:02:45.000> say<00:02:45.209> if<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.450> works<00:02:45.689> or

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
so I can't really say if that works or

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.309 
so I can't really say if that works or
not<00:02:46.099> but<00:02:47.099> yeah<00:02:47.790> nike<00:02:48.239> definitely<00:02:48.810> gets<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.109> 10

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
not but yeah nike definitely gets a 10

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.229 
not but yeah nike definitely gets a 10
out<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.530> 10<00:02:49.650> for<00:02:50.040> technology<00:02:50.579> wise<00:02:50.760> not<00:02:51.030> really

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
out of 10 for technology wise not really

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.910 
out of 10 for technology wise not really
sure<00:02:51.359> if<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.569> technology<00:02:51.750> helps<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.500> all<00:02:52.620> but

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
sure if the technology helps it all but

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.399 
sure if the technology helps it all but
I<00:02:53.129> mean<00:02:53.909> hey<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.359> pack<00:02:54.599> this<00:02:54.780> thing<00:02:55.019> full<00:02:55.379> of

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
I mean hey they pack this thing full of

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.910 
I mean hey they pack this thing full of
technology<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.709> yeah<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.019> design<00:03:01.560> and

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
technology so yeah I to the design and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.160 
technology so yeah I to the design and
color<00:03:02.400> way<00:03:02.609> this<00:03:02.849> was<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.239> release<00:03:03.569> colorway

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
color way this was the release colorway

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.420 
color way this was the release colorway
for<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.159> Superfly<00:03:05.730> 3<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.629> I<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.829> do<00:03:08.040> like

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
for the Superfly 3 and I really do like

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.890 
for the Superfly 3 and I really do like
the<00:03:09.030> color<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.730> pops<00:03:12.030> out<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.329> lot<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:12.750> real

you got this thing on your instep here
really<00:03:21.690> pops<00:03:22.019> out<00:03:23.239> great<00:03:24.239> for<00:03:24.540> wieners<00:03:24.930> and

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
really pops out great for wieners and

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.129 
really pops out great for wieners and
forwards<00:03:26.150> that's<00:03:27.150> people<00:03:27.449> looking<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:27.989> some

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
forwards that's people looking for some

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.379 
forwards that's people looking for some
extra<00:03:28.230> speed<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.370> purple<00:03:29.790> looks<00:03:29.910> really<00:03:30.209> nice

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
together I think nike hit a home run

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.009 
together I think nike hit a home run
with<00:03:34.919> this<00:03:35.129> color<00:03:35.489> wed<00:03:35.699> i<00:03:36.000> really<00:03:36.299> do<00:03:36.449> enjoy<00:03:36.660> it

so definitely a 10 out of 10 for the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.170 
so definitely a 10 out of 10 for the
colorway<00:03:39.900> their<00:03:40.340> durability<00:03:41.340> durability

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
colorway their durability durability

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
really great for me so far no nothing to

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.619 
really great for me so far no nothing to
report<00:03:49.169> really<00:03:50.030> except<00:03:51.030> for<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.239> fact<00:03:51.449> that

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
report really except for the fact that

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.240 
report really except for the fact that
i'm<00:03:52.169> not<00:03:52.199> sure<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.650> can<00:03:52.709> see<00:03:52.829> this<00:03:53.069> but

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
i'm not sure if you can see this but

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.809 
i'm not sure if you can see this but
right<00:03:54.060> here<00:03:54.269> i<00:03:54.329> don't<00:03:54.569> know<00:03:54.629> it's<00:03:54.810> just<00:03:54.900> some

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
right here i don't know it's just some

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.640 
right here i don't know it's just some
the<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:58.459> tation<00:03:59.659> titian<00:04:00.659> microfiber<00:04:01.290> seems

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
the the tation titian microfiber seems

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.430 
the the tation titian microfiber seems
to<00:04:01.799> have<00:04:01.949> a<00:04:01.980> little<00:04:02.340> bit<00:04:02.489> uh<00:04:02.519> just<00:04:03.049> dents<00:04:04.049> in<00:04:04.290> it

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
to have a little bit uh just dents in it

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.659 
to have a little bit uh just dents in it
and<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:04.859> really<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:05.310> know<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.549> really

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
and it's really you know it's really

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.839 
and it's really you know it's really
stiff<00:04:06.349> but<00:04:07.349> you<00:04:07.500> know<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:07.799> it's<00:04:08.010> been

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
stiff but you know it's it's been

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.699 
stiff but you know it's it's been
durable<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.510> mean<00:04:09.659> it's<00:04:09.840> held<00:04:10.079> up<00:04:10.229> but<00:04:10.500> it's

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
durable I mean it's held up but it's

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.680 
durable I mean it's held up but it's
it's<00:04:11.370> looking<00:04:11.729> like<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.090> doesn't<00:04:12.419> have<00:04:12.659> that

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
it's looking like it doesn't have that

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.809 
it's looking like it doesn't have that
much<00:04:12.989> left<00:04:13.290> on<00:04:13.979> it<00:04:14.159> you<00:04:14.250> know<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.370> don't<00:04:14.549> think

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
much left on it you know I don't think

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.399 
much left on it you know I don't think
you<00:04:14.940> could<00:04:15.090> get<00:04:15.239> more<00:04:15.419> than<00:04:15.629> a<00:04:15.659> season<00:04:16.109> out<00:04:16.260> of

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
you could get more than a season out of

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.009 
you could get more than a season out of
these<00:04:16.530> things<00:04:16.820> but<00:04:17.820> um<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.329> their<00:04:18.720> current

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
these things but um in their current

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.459 
these things but um in their current
condition<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.650> mean<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:19.919> can't<00:04:20.159> really<00:04:20.400> complain

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:21.469 
condition I mean I can't really complain

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:25.370 
condition I mean I can't really complain
I<00:04:22.849> have<00:04:23.849> also<00:04:24.090> heard<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.780> studs<00:04:25.139> have

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
I have also heard that the studs have

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.890 
I have also heard that the studs have
fallen<00:04:25.770> off<00:04:25.889> but<00:04:26.310> minor<00:04:26.810> /

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
fallen off but minor /

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.719 
fallen off but minor /
intact<00:04:28.470> I'm<00:04:28.680> not<00:04:28.830> really<00:04:28.949> sure<00:04:29.070> if<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:29.669> is

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
intact I'm not really sure if this is

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.249 
intact I'm not really sure if this is
normal<00:04:30.030> right<00:04:30.270> here<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.750> let<00:04:30.840> me<00:04:30.900> see<00:04:31.080> if<00:04:31.139> I

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
normal right here and let me see if I

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.340 
normal right here and let me see if I
can<00:04:31.350> get<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:32.720> looks<00:04:33.720> like<00:04:33.870> there's<00:04:34.080> kind<00:04:34.290> of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
can get that looks like there's kind of

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.590 
can get that looks like there's kind of
a<00:04:34.470> cut<00:04:35.100> right<00:04:35.370> there<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:35.940> carbon<00:04:36.330> fiber

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
a cut right there on the carbon fiber

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.700 
a cut right there on the carbon fiber
and<00:04:36.930> then<00:04:37.080> it's<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:37.889> two<00:04:38.580> more<00:04:38.850> right<00:04:39.090> there

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
and then it's like two more right there

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.529 
and then it's like two more right there
those<00:04:40.710> might<00:04:40.889> be<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:41.070> problem<00:04:41.430> considering<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
those might be a problem considering the

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.090 
those might be a problem considering the
lead<00:04:42.780> up<00:04:42.930> right<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.410> stud<00:04:45.050> but<00:04:46.050> you<00:04:46.979> know<00:04:47.039> I

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
lead up right to the stud but you know I

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.010 
lead up right to the stud but you know I
guess<00:04:47.340> only<00:04:47.460> time<00:04:47.729> will<00:04:47.789> tell<00:04:47.940> but<00:04:48.150> for<00:04:48.900> now<00:04:48.990> I

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
guess only time will tell but for now I

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.600 
guess only time will tell but for now I
mean<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:49.410> got<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.650> give<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.889> Nike<00:04:50.220> day<00:04:50.370> they

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
mean you got to give it to Nike day they

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.330 
mean you got to give it to Nike day they
did<00:04:50.789> a<00:04:50.820> good<00:04:51.000> job<00:04:51.650> making<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.830> shoes<00:04:53.100> pretty

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
did a good job making the shoes pretty

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.540 
did a good job making the shoes pretty
durable<00:04:53.720> but<00:04:54.740> looking<00:04:55.740> where<00:04:55.949> they're<00:04:56.100> going

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
durable but looking where they're going

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.029 
durable but looking where they're going
I'd<00:04:56.789> probably<00:04:57.030> get<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.419> eight<00:04:58.259> out<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.710> ten

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
I'd probably get it eight out of ten

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.159 
I'd probably get it eight out of ten
durability<00:04:59.789> wise<00:05:00.139> not<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.410> most<00:05:03.169> durable

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
durability wise not the most durable

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.600 
durability wise not the most durable
shoes<00:05:04.770> ever<00:05:06.199> performance<00:05:07.199> wise<00:05:07.410> now<00:05:08.400> I<00:05:08.430> know<00:05:08.460> a

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
shoes ever performance wise now I know a

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.580 
shoes ever performance wise now I know a
lot<00:05:08.760> of<00:05:08.820> people<00:05:08.910> have<00:05:09.240> been<00:05:09.300> wondering<00:05:09.870> what's

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
lot of people have been wondering what's

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.110 
lot of people have been wondering what's
the<00:05:10.620> difference<00:05:11.070> between<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.460> vapor<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.060> the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
the difference between the vapor and the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.990 
the difference between the vapor and the
Superfly<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.919> be<00:05:13.979> honest<00:05:14.280> not<00:05:14.370> much<00:05:14.430> I

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
Superfly and to be honest not much I

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.510 
Superfly and to be honest not much I
mean<00:05:15.300> other<00:05:15.960> than<00:05:16.139> your<00:05:16.440> fly<00:05:16.650> wire<00:05:16.919> your

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
mean other than your fly wire your

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.250 
mean other than your fly wire your
carbon<00:05:17.880> fiber<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.270> your<00:05:18.389> sin<00:05:18.600> studs<00:05:18.990> they're

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
carbon fiber and your sin studs they're

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.550 
carbon fiber and your sin studs they're
not<00:05:20.070> uh<00:05:20.340> not<00:05:20.910> really<00:05:21.419> a<00:05:21.570> big<00:05:21.780> difference<00:05:22.289> I

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
not uh not really a big difference I

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.010 
not uh not really a big difference I
don't<00:05:23.460> really<00:05:23.610> see<00:05:23.729> why<00:05:23.940> these<00:05:24.210> are<00:05:24.479> worth<00:05:24.780> two

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
don't really see why these are worth two

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.560 
don't really see why these are worth two
hundred<00:05:25.320> dollars<00:05:25.590> more<00:05:25.949> I<00:05:26.300> think<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.389> lot<00:05:27.539> of

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
hundred dollars more I think a lot of

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.969 
hundred dollars more I think a lot of
people<00:05:27.690> kind<00:05:28.110> of<00:05:28.229> caught<00:05:28.440> on<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.949> fact

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
people kind of caught on to the fact

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.040 
people kind of caught on to the fact
that<00:05:29.310> Nikes<00:05:30.120> just<00:05:30.330> trying<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.690> make<00:05:30.810> some

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
that Nikes just trying to make some

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.420 
that Nikes just trying to make some
extra<00:05:31.199> money<00:05:31.410> off<00:05:31.800> these<00:05:32.010> things<00:05:32.370> and<00:05:32.669> so<00:05:34.430> with

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
extra money off these things and so with

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.680 
extra money off these things and so with
the<00:05:35.520> vapor<00:05:35.729> eights<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.240> think<00:05:36.419> they<00:05:36.510> made<00:05:36.660> the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
the vapor eights I think they made the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.420 
the vapor eights I think they made the
right<00:05:36.780> decision<00:05:37.320> did<00:05:37.500> not<00:05:37.530> have<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.889> super<00:05:38.099> fly

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
right decision did not have a super fly

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.580 
right decision did not have a super fly
series<00:05:38.849> because<00:05:39.120> people<00:05:39.900> kind<00:05:40.139> of<00:05:40.260> caught<00:05:40.560> on

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
series because people kind of caught on

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.379 
series because people kind of caught on
to<00:05:40.979> that<00:05:41.010> gimmick<00:05:43.490> but<00:05:45.169> yeah<00:05:46.169> I<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:48.120> really

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
to that gimmick but yeah I not really

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.969 
to that gimmick but yeah I not really
sure<00:05:48.570> what<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:48.840> big<00:05:49.020> difference<00:05:49.440> is<00:05:49.710> between

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
sure what the big difference is between

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.850 
sure what the big difference is between
them<00:05:50.400> if<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.479> were<00:05:51.630> you<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:51.810> go<00:05:52.169> with<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.349> vapors

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
them if I were you I go with the vapors

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.040 
them if I were you I go with the vapors
unless<00:05:53.820> you<00:05:54.000> just<00:05:54.150> want<00:05:54.419> to<00:05:54.479> have<00:05:54.659> a<00:05:54.690> pair<00:05:54.990> of

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
unless you just want to have a pair of
