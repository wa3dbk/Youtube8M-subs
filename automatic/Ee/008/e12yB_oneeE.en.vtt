00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
fill out the whole cookie with the icing

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.190 
fill out the whole cookie with the icing
and<00:01:03.439> you<00:01:04.640> can<00:01:05.640> use<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> toothpick<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> needle

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
tool to spread the icing around where

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.270 
tool to spread the icing around where
especially<00:01:10.080> around<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> ears<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.070> gets

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
especially around the ears it gets

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.179 
especially around the ears it gets
little<00:01:11.580> tight<00:01:11.970> there<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.530> while<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
little tight there so and now while the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.730 
little tight there so and now while the
icing<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> still<00:01:14.970> wet<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:16.110> start<00:01:16.439> piping

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
icing is still wet you can start piping

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.429 
icing is still wet you can start piping
the<00:01:17.100> branch<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> branch<00:01:19.200> I'm

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the branch and to make the branch I'm

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.399 
the branch and to make the branch I'm
using<00:01:19.729> 15<00:01:20.729> second<00:01:21.090> icing<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
using 15 second icing this is a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.899 
using 15 second icing this is a
chocolate<00:01:23.070> brown<00:01:23.369> icing<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.610> once<00:01:26.610> you're

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
chocolate brown icing and once you're

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
chocolate brown icing and once you're
done<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.869> branch<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.650> add<00:01:28.829> little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
done with the branch you can add little

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.899 
done with the branch you can add little
flowers<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.000> adding<00:01:30.360> few<00:01:30.780> dots<00:01:31.220> around<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
flowers just adding few dots around the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.429 
flowers just adding few dots around the
branch<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:35.780> since<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:36.990> doing<00:01:37.020> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
branch and since you are doing this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
branch and since you are doing this
while<00:01:37.829> your<00:01:38.040> base<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.700> wet<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.270> think

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
while your base is still wet I think

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
while your base is still wet I think
will<00:01:40.200> stick<00:01:40.560> into<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> base<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.610> will<00:01:41.880> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
will stick into the base and will it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.539 
will stick into the base and will it
will<00:01:42.210> create<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:43.020> layer<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.009> need<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> let

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
will create one layer so you need to let

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.359 
will create one layer so you need to let
this<00:01:44.729> dry<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.299> once<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.930> dry<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.649> apply

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
this dry and once it's dry we can apply

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.810 
this dry and once it's dry we can apply
additional<00:01:48.149> details<00:01:49.280> here<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.670> mixing

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
