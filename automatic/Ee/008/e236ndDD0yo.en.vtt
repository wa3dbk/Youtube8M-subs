00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:22.330
 How are you guys today ? 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.560
 Main line of Yes qualifying in the first online now that we are doing in the Circuit de Catalunya this time 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.790
 Three laps is a game 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.710
 By the way , I have been running here in Forsa, so I have confidence and this race is 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.200
 The course introduced while the qualifying put in has become a McLaren gt 3 vehicle one person 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.940
 To go 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.960
 Although it is more or less appropriate, this driving follows the realistic regulation 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:46.670
 Please note that there are some differences . 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.260
 Be careful of the brake lock because the 12 corners that you just passed are long straight ends. 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.489
 This is the right corner 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.190
 It is a bumping girl dangerous corner, but it is quite a time not to fly in full open 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.730
 It will be a loss 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.989
 It had Dorittoshi in reverse run up to the first corner from here in Forusa 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.760
 It is said that this hairpin opens too fast and pops out because I can not see the exit 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.040
 This corner a miss occurs frequently 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.270
 In fact , 3 cars were scrapped in this course and the 9 second hairpin was just a hairpin 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.180
 It is tighter than it is here, so it is downhill, so too fast for cornering 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.400
 It is a note 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:22.960
 The section to here is a fairly simple feeling I went to 9 s letter 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:28.210
 This will end up in this kind of thing in the confusing braking point 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.690
 Approach in the out-side from here Well I is coming car from left back and from Ottoon is dangerous 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.880
 Follow 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:38.470
 4 was uhh cormorants dangerous determine the clean-de-lit and not you come here into the e 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.950
 Next time I'm bump drafting from behind, it's ok I should just keep it 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.610
 This child is a slow corners missing a long back straight that the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 I wish Let's be careful since become overrun If you do not exactly deceleration 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.640
 The complex corner of my mistake but here and there must be tight load transfer 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.170
 It becomes difficult to bend 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:01.520
 So let's use a lot of foot brakes, and it's already the last corner 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.970
 I death of the last corner before let in as much as possible not to get on the curb 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.920
 Otherwise it causes spin 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:12.750
 You And although here also I'm riding Gattsuri to Utte or curb you aware of the load movement 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.450
 Is decided to cover with my arms, it's the last corner than that 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.800
 Course introduction is over by this by saying that 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.129
 Now Now because the rest has been time also is less Naa and not issued tightly time in this week 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:30.340
 Zoo Oh elevation final corner go Oraora 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.340
 Oh Oh Oh balance over this even where there is a prospect of the top time hopefully 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.930
 Seriously 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.610
 I waited for a moment and waited for a while and I got a tire 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.340
 This is a red flag suspension , so it's annoying other drivers 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.950
 That's right I don't move it fast 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.950
 It was good if I'm tentatively move 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:59.430
 I wonder if the other person who got stream caution is okay 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.060
 I'm sorry I made a conclusion, because I was retired and I didn't have time, so I got it randomly 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.340
 It would become in 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.340
 Well Oh hi dudes go makeup from now 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:15.359
 The race will begin with that the host is this I 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.109
 It started with the fact that the turret will serve 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.640
 Is the order of table tennis 2 players such as before and after caution? 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:25.360
 Teeth yellow was to 60% of the Tats player 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.680
 Also crash early straight from the players 7 weeks while standing 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:35.260
 A player who stands down to 4th place during breastfeeding 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:41.630
 I got in from the center and here in Article 115 but in front of the fierce battle ah ah too people 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:45.710
 I'm alright , it's alright, so I 'll come back to the 5th place with aa. 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.610
 You can see the three fierce battle zones ahead of the Lord 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:53.930
 The back is a hairpin that doesn't fit well 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:58.430
 4th place McLaren stuck in gravel and went from slow down out 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.600
 It seems that it did not reach to the overtaking, but the pressure on the car ahead because the difference was reduced 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.900
 Will take 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.290
 It's a long time ago I'm getting stuck, Singing players 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.630
 It has led quite also behind or can be the difference in things 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.140
 Dangerous next corner braking point easy to mistake 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:16.310
 Attention will turn to the all models clean where needed in 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.400
 Hmm a bit wrong around the ah ah ah ah 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.210
 The tuts break their balance here and go out of course 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.250
 Crash on the opposite side of the wall in Taï½° its momentum Chima' doing 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.510
 It seems to have suffered some damage, and to lower the ranking to the bottom of the players here 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.070
 It would become in 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.330
 I because they solidified the car before all right because I'll bounce back from Makoko 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.190
 I waited a moment -this command 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.880
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.930
 I was there is a dangerous scene is dangerous was a little while ago Fu 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:49.640
 It seems there is a problem with is running so no problem to run in 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:54.249
 It was quite aggressive, and it was awful to have a pin following car here 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.249
 Let's definitely go and see how 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:02.289
 The last player kept 15th at the last minute 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:03.429
 Oh time over # 5 of boots of Yan around the larger is the difference between the front of the car but was defended 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.459
 And will directly below 

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:10.389
 The final corner is getting close by saying he calmly even when what if my force can cope 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:14.879
 It came 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.879
 I'm just running for the second week so I cut it 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:25.040
 The last time I finally saw now The bottom is because there was no one who was the bottom last time 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:30.290
 I can not run straight with my damage 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.060
 Here you can see the damage of the traffic reading love reading car from here also here 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.370
 Crashed and severely damaged 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:39.990
 I'm fluttering It's born a new crash 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.340
 The pit-in instruction is given from the pit that will go if it goes slowly with this 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.740
 This is final lap 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.040
 This is the only way to go this straight end 0 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.110
 Poya 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:53.480
 How are you 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:57.710
 It seems that it is a miracle that it can crash and run still again straight 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:01.520
 You can finish the run if you finish off this week 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:06.230
 Areare engine does not blow at my McLaren 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.160
 Is what the car of the tap 2 players eventful deployment Tats racing in this final lap 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.420
 Slow down 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.470
 It is thought that the engine blows because the smoke is coming out and it will be retired here 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.610
 This race was another half a lap 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.610
 I will not finish the run 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:25.569
