00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.349
 Today I want to use for a pedicure 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.120
 tropical flowers and I will understand 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.910
 a small five-day vacation would be desirable 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.560
 so that the pedicure somehow matched this 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.750
 the flower is pretty big for mine 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.550
 narrow nails he is absolutely not 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.890
 fits just like palm trees but for 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 big toes it seems to me the size 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.420
 perfect to put paint on drawing 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.089
 remove all the excess raise picture 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.890
 stamped 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:36.879
 I 'll fix the palm top so as not to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.789
 smear drawing 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.739
 put a one-touch top is not necessary 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.839
 carry brushes 20 times one and the same 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.749
 same place for gradient 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.850
 we apply varnishes on sponge and and gradient i 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.999
 I will do directly on the stamp 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.769
 just because I can't stand in 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.510
 that will be what i usually do 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:00.219
 lice culture there minutes and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.379
 neatly do hail them on the stamp 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.780
 with this option it is necessary to give 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.909
 dry up each layer so as not to tear off 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.340
 drawing a little bit literally waiting for yes 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.060
 let it dry and make the next one put 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.270
 next layer 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.380
 i use lilac blue and green 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.860
 and give billets finally dried up 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.870
