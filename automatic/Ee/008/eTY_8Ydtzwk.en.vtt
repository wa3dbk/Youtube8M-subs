00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.160
 hello today we are going to give you a very trick 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.129
 simple to measure the amount of pasta 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.089
 what do we need to make a recipe 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.950
 since one of the problems 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.320
 main ones when there is this type 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.360
 of food is to measure exactly what 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.970
 amount we will require depending 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.650
 of the number of people that we are and if 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.510
 it is not done well, what exceeds 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.430
 what's left or are we left with two cults 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.980
 The trick that we are going to give you is to 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.570
 measure up to short of time until this 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.020
 style that you can see me in the image 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.790
 that are sharks macaroni a little bit 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.040
 That style would not be worth for spaghetti 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.500
 for example for noodles and is a 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 trick to measure a quantity for what 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 that would be two people 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.750
 the trick in question would be very simple 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.430
 we would take as a reference a plate of 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.860
 which we are going to use to grill the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.260
 pasta cooked for example us 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.470
 let's throw this dish deep and 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.470
 then what do we harvest the crude 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 pasta 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.830
 the amount that has to be 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.280
 fasta for two people will be the pasta 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.200
 raw material that covers the bottom of the plate is 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.480
 will be the amount that once cooked 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.550
 will be good for us to share between two 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.220
 dishes since then normally you will 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.750
 usually throw sauce on others 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.720
 ingredients with what would be a dish 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.550
 more complete that there are times that people 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.820
 that then the person who is going to eat the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.610
 pasta is more like it needs more 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.470
 amount to feel satiated then 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.900
 you just had to have a little 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.500
 more but not more than what is the part 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.110
 rasa of the plate and without likewise if 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.240
 We eat less grass because we had to throw 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.400
 or arrive with less quantity but 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.280
 normally it is the flat plate 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.740
 filled with the house in raw the measure 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.630
 for two people now we see how 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.630
 will be cooking this peace 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.670
 once we have cooked run to 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.470
 our pasta as you see the amount that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.110
 we have measured at the beginning of the video we 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.540
 has given to take two plates so 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.480
 we both have two servings if it has 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.260
