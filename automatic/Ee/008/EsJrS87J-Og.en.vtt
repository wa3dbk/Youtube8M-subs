00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.940 
dislike I had to bleach it I've heard
with<00:02:19.450> your<00:02:19.629> own<00:02:19.780> rustles<00:02:20.230> products<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.860> you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
with your own rustles products that you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.440 
with your own rustles products that you
could<00:02:21.129> just<00:02:21.220> put<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.489> on<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.090> get<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.239> nice

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
could just put it on and you get a nice

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.170 
could just put it on and you get a nice
color<00:02:22.980> I'm<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.310> sure<00:02:24.579> I've<00:02:24.670> never<00:02:24.819> done<00:02:25.150> that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
color I'm not sure I've never done that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.449 
color I'm not sure I've never done that
but<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.900> think<00:02:26.019> it's<00:02:26.290> possible<00:02:26.530> because<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.400> a

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
but I think it's possible because it's a

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.899 
but I think it's possible because it's a
conditioning<00:02:28.269> it's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.659> it's<00:02:29.290> an<00:02:29.560> original

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
conditioning it's a it's an original

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.369 
conditioning it's a it's an original
semi-permanent<00:02:30.930> conditioning<00:02:31.930> hair<00:02:32.079> color

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
semi-permanent conditioning hair color

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.949 
semi-permanent conditioning hair color
she<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:32.769> gives<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.069> color<00:02:33.400> nonetheless<00:02:33.959> so

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
she just gives you color nonetheless so

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.619 
she just gives you color nonetheless so
I<00:02:35.560> think<00:02:35.829> that<00:02:36.459> could<00:02:36.760> be<00:02:37.109> done<00:02:38.109> that<00:02:38.409> way<00:02:39.629> now

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
I think that could be done that way now

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.559 
I think that could be done that way now
instead<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.590> talking<00:02:41.829> let<00:02:42.250> me<00:02:42.430> also<00:02:42.819> talking<00:02:43.299> I

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
instead of talking let me also talking I

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.210 
instead of talking let me also talking I
should<00:02:43.780> also<00:02:43.930> show<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.440> consistency<00:02:44.769> of

should also show you the consistency of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.280 
should also show you the consistency of
the<00:02:45.400> color<00:02:45.609> it<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.629> vibrant<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.730> kind<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
the color it is vibrant it's kind of the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.680 
the color it is vibrant it's kind of the
consistency<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.250> easy<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.940> work<00:02:52.150> with

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
consistency is easy to work with

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.750 
consistency is easy to work with
however<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.409> wish<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.010> jar<00:02:54.280> would<00:02:54.549> have<00:02:54.639> been<00:02:54.730> a

however I wish the jar would have been a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.680 
however I wish the jar would have been a
little<00:02:54.909> bit<00:02:55.120> bigger

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.550 
it's kind of small and if you have long
hair<00:02:58.299> like<00:02:58.329> me<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.109> want<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.379> dye<00:02:59.530> your

two times I believe it's like two times
a<00:03:55.180> week<00:03:55.359> and<00:03:56.319> in<00:03:56.470> between<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:57.190> use<00:03:57.430> dry

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
a week and in between I just use dry

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.500 
a week and in between I just use dry
soap<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:59.199> lasts<00:03:59.560> me<00:03:59.889> for<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.310> month<00:04:00.819> and<00:04:01.120> I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
soap and it lasts me for a month and I

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.449 
soap and it lasts me for a month and I
mean<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.750> month<00:04:02.049> vibrant<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:02.980> this

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
mean a month vibrant like this

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.759 
mean a month vibrant like this
you<00:04:03.579> start<00:04:03.879> seeing<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.750> kind<00:04:05.019> of<00:04:05.260> coming<00:04:05.620> off

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
you start seeing it kind of coming off

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.710 
you start seeing it kind of coming off
after<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.519> month<00:04:06.760> which<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.180> think<00:04:07.479> that<00:04:07.599> is

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
after the month which I think that is

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.330 
after the month which I think that is
great<00:04:08.019> because<00:04:08.319> if<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.530> use<00:04:08.769> Manic<00:04:09.159> Panic
