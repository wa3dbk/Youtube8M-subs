 queta welcome to another annual minimum for our p3 x razer motorola this 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.510
 manual is to be able to change the volume levels to our times x 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.919
 because who knows why 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.239
 but they came with a volume somewhat limited or very small until 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.439
 times at the strongest level 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.130
 and if these circus and ubs you have to take advantage 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 in the voice and we do not give innate that we have sea 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.509
 Well, if it is a voice and you call me before working 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.199
 milestones that are worth the horn we have to make it sound pretty loud 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.620
 first of all 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.400
 I want to thank you very much because this manual was achieved 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.440
 by the users of what the world community motorola dot net 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 one is the user p moto 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.710
 because he was the one who got the tickle and because he weighed asking 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.820
 how could you 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.420
 change the volume 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 and the other user is Juan Carlos 225 who felt the solution 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.080
 thanks to them we can have our annual minimum 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.140
 to change the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.000
 the volume to our profile is x 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.180
 first of all 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.470
 I'll leave the description of this video a league 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 an address to see and download the folder that we are going to use right now 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.120
 download folder and buy them 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.170
 then we connect our phone with the cable course of eta the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.550
 computer 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.280
 we have the data transfer mode not for the reader to go 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.610
 memory 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.380
 you know we discussed it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.900
 i automatically 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.220
 will open us 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.610
 the ppe looks for comander that we have already installed previously 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.670
 we enter 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 you already know how to cross penÃ©lope or phone 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 what we are going to do now is change the modify the audio do not create 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.630
 what 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.859
 is going to stay with a sound 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.430
 with a volume level 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.670
 has already determined that you can go down or go up quite the opposite 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.720
 suppose I said before volume 7 went up 7 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.050
 today it will be like a messi symbol that you heard the volume 13 your phone 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.260
 in level 3 it will not change them at all 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.810
 missives in a solid way that you can not control how they can lower it 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.019
 how can they climb it 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.409
 only that it is heard louder 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.940
 well, we entered the folder 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.069
 on your phone that knows we're 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.859

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.169
 go and paste the jump to the system folder 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.679

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.759
 cfc 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.599
 point p 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.909
 Deepened that a low CFC 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.309
 point p 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:49.129
 that file I recommend you make a copy for fernandez who returns the 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.829
 phone to its original volume status 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.429
 the were a copy make a folder that get 3x original sound and make 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.160

 You already know how to make it in your folder, look for it here 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.699

 and we copy it to that folder 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.839
 since we have done that 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.179

 I have come here a number 2 3 4 5 6 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.879
 those are the levels of audio that we have to be able to make our 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.009
 phone 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:42.109
 I chose level 5 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.829
 you can have level 4 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.899
 which you choose 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:51.029
 from the root folder because from here we can not do it we're going to 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.919

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.949
 we go to the root folder where we have our 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.099
 those commands 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.559

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.079
 given the cpc 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.099
 5 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.869
 we will remove 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.439

 file with the name as I had it in that they were inside the phone that did not 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.409
 had a number 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.409
 then we change the name 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.459

 he painted the audio face and still under cpg 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.409

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.270
 the phone folder 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.770
 whether you run in the original phone or just let 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.169
 this one the screening envelopes 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.560

 we disconnected our greeting 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.090
 I recommend restarting wait 10 15 seconds 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.279
 they turn it on again 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.430
 I felt it is because I really feel it is not so much listening they are going to feel 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.650
 the audio difference with which our phone now has this peter x ras 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.419
 Well, I'm saying goodbye to that annual minimum, I hope it worked for you 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.849

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.270
