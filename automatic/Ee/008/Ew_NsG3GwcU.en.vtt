00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.560

 Thank you for you can see the video 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:16.710
 This time , I would like to explain how to create a Google Adsense ad unit 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:22.410
 First of all, that ad unit 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 With google you can now manage the ads per unit 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 I am 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.930
 Well that's about that ad to paste 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.329
 How to make a unit, etc. It is this unit. 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.629
 Well ad lit thing 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:42.179
 If you say what kind of thing there is when you create 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:45.350
 It seems from this management screen that you chose performance freezing and then ad unit 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:50.480
 It's a feeling, but here 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:53.030
 Kedomo I know well of the same size of the size of the ad that say the same rectangle size in the case of I 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.030
 If so, it is under this title 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.300
 In the middle of the article or under the article 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.239
 Well it that is such a that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.080
 Depending on where you place the ad, depending on where you place the ad, manage by giving that black knit name 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.440
 is 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:16.020
 It is by doing this that one heck ads anywhere in the placement of the high profitability of the masochist 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:21.149
 It is Toka or click-through rate is high for well inherit the sort of thing 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.560
 Because it is convenient Well In response to such is the ne location, such as to create an ad unit to 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:29.719
 Is recommended 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.719
 Well then let's explain how to create a real ad unit 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.130
 And we have to log in to the management screen of Haie is the first Hey sense 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:47.540
 Click on the ad settings 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:52.370
 On the next screen, click on the new ad unit 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.040
 If you do so, you will move to the screen to create an English knit, so it is here 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.800
 Mother's name 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:04.300
 Well, I recommend that you give the ad a name for easy management when you see it later . 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:10.119
 Well, that's right here even if I say something about my previous example 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:14.030
 It is the kind of advertisement that it is the title because it is said that it is a large rectangle 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:19.040
 From the place of that arrangement and me If this something I 8 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.460
 I 'll put a name like this in a way that makes it easy to put it back here 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.670
 Well proceed as such 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:30.820
 Continue to select the size of the ad, so click here 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:37.360
 This and this is the ne bi loan 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:39.020
 Here is what to choose, so let 's choose this rectangle size this time. 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.840
 I think but 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.760
 Here's the word "Crystal" which says that Google is advertising the recommended size 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.439
 is not it 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.090
 Well it is well of that advertising is the I mean Tsu size that is the recommended 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:03:00.489
 Since it or heard in the unit price or Toka Well that way higher 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.849
 As long as the Well but I think the kana from those of the crystal Well Pick go of is the good that can be Well 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.750
 Well each place to install 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.150
 I think it depends on the space 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:14.270
 Well depending on the space of the homepage I want to paste each 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.430
 I hope you Well can choose it is the ad 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.720
 It seems that it would be more profitable to choose from drinking this crystal as much as possible. 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.720
 There is something 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:33.069
 It is continued, but there is place called ad type here 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:38.920
 This is the default for text ads and display ads 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:42.569
 If there is no trout something that Good Well I am particularly well and this text kelp 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.450
 It is recommended to leave this default for display ads 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:51.129
 If you say why, this Google is not 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:57.140
 This is the text ad and the display ad respectively 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:04:02.300
 By having a high unit price that is given to priority is that me was now automatically to display 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.709
 Well If you could be Tteyuu want that or to display only text ads still without de Well 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.720
 I'm fine but 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.860
 It is good to leave the default as it is unless there is something particular 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.709
 And I think 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:20.130
 Yes then it's the style of advertising here, but here too 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:26.190
 Or the color of the link each and in that blue 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:30.849
 Title are various types of each Well also I'd url is Toka green in blue 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.090
 There is, but if this is not something in particular either, it may be said that this default is good 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.810
 think 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:42.120
 Well probably it is wool but as a result of having been variously verified 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:46.800
 In the case of many Kedomo based also Well the design of it is usually Well the home page 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.230
 Well the fact that the default of the design will be well profitable here 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.500
 I think it's the default 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.570
 I think it's ok if you don't have any particular feelings 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.630
 Yes er to save If you can be set up to this point and click with the fact that get the code 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.630
 I will 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:10.380
 If you do so, the code will be generated like this: here in the ward 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:16.080
 Click 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:20.810
 If you do so the entire code will be in the selected state of the entire ad code 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:26.120
 Here you a copy with the right-click 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.650
 Now I that this code is on that clipboard has become a state that has been copied 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.330
 So this 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:37.960
 It is a place that I want to paste well It is a homepage and a corner log 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.960
 It is why Well ads that paste can be posted Well in this 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:45.999
 Yes, if you try to return to this, it will be made earlier as it is a large rectangle title 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.810
 It is advertisement 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:51.830
 Generated 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:57.660
 It is here Well yet Ah to in this text image 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:06:03.180
 All by say 280 multiplied by 336 3 types both of the same type 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.810
 I guess that's the same type and size of the ad, but I also gave this title 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.180
 And 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:15.150
 Article or in the middle of the article Well in the beginning by separating that management like this 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:20.520
 As you mentioned, it can also be used for a reasonable examination of profitability after holding 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:23.610
 Well by all means in this way by all means by all means watching this video 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.400
 Has gotten everyone also Toka that this kind of way 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:33.960
