was<00:02:10.570> awesomely<00:02:11.530> problem<00:02:11.980> was<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:13.120> have

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
was awesomely problem was that we have

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.650 
was awesomely problem was that we have
quite<00:02:13.810> steep<00:02:14.170> climbs<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.420> there<00:02:16.420> are<00:02:16.510> no

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
quite steep climbs and there are no

chemicals<00:02:17.230> or<00:02:17.769> lifts<00:02:18.070> very<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.489> take<00:02:18.700> up<00:02:18.850> your

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
chemicals or lifts very can take up your

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.540 
chemicals or lifts very can take up your
bike<00:02:19.150> which<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.050> actually<00:02:20.260> also<00:02:20.590> not<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.340> main

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
bike which is actually also not the main

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.860
