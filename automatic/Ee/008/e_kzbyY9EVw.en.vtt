00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.910 
really never going to be on the Xbox one
because<00:01:47.579> Sony<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.090> backing<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.680> one

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
because Sony is backing it that one

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.520 
because Sony is backing it that one
action<00:01:50.340> though<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.759> Sony<00:01:51.060> did<00:01:51.390> makes<00:01:52.320> me

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
action though that Sony did makes me

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.219 
action though that Sony did makes me
hope<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.100> blood-borne<00:01:54.090> could<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> same

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
hope that blood-borne could be the same

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.429 
hope that blood-borne could be the same
I<00:01:55.500> personally<00:01:56.189> believe<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.270> blood-borne<00:01:58.229> is

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
I personally believe that blood-borne is

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.649 
I personally believe that blood-borne is
only<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.189> released<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> ps4<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
only going to be released on the ps4 and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.530 
only going to be released on the ps4 and
unless<00:02:01.290> Sony<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:02.280> themselves<00:02:03.030> say

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
unless Sony or from themselves say

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.959 
unless Sony or from themselves say
otherwise<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.409> wouldn't<00:02:05.159> expect<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> be

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
otherwise I wouldn't expect it to be

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.730 
otherwise I wouldn't expect it to be
released<00:02:06.329> even<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> pc

the main reason why I'm even bringing

the main reason why I'm even bringing
this<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:10.739> with<00:02:11.400> articles<00:02:11.849> like

did for capcom that makes me have hope
for<00:02:35.400> blood-borne<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.569> in<00:02:36.690> all<00:02:36.840> honesty<00:02:37.349> it's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
for blood-borne but in all honesty it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.680 
for blood-borne but in all honesty it's
very<00:02:37.890> unlikely<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.849> would<00:02:39.269> be<00:02:39.420> very

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
very unlikely and would be very

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.870 
very unlikely and would be very
surprising<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:40.680> did<00:02:40.980> release<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
surprising if they did release it on the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
to work with steam that wouldn't be

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.650 
to work with steam that wouldn't be
unexpected<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.269> wouldn't<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.630> very

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
unexpected and that wouldn't be very

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.449 
unexpected and that wouldn't be very
surprising<00:03:31.260> but<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.799> same<00:03:31.980> time<00:03:32.190> that's

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
surprising but at the same time that's

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.690 
surprising but at the same time that's
also<00:03:32.850> very<00:03:33.019> very<00:03:34.019> unlikely<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.920> like<00:03:35.549> i<00:03:35.640> said

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
also very very unlikely and like i said

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.390 
also very very unlikely and like i said
i<00:03:35.850> would<00:03:36.060> rather<00:03:36.299> tell<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.660> guys<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.650> brutal

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
i would rather tell you guys the brutal

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.370 
i would rather tell you guys the brutal
honesty<00:03:38.940> then<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.750> get<00:03:39.870> your<00:03:40.019> hopes<00:03:40.140> up<00:03:40.319> for

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
honesty then to get your hopes up for

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.960 
honesty then to get your hopes up for
nothing<00:03:40.799> but<00:03:41.130> that's<00:03:41.370> pretty<00:03:41.519> much<00:03:41.730> going<00:03:41.910> to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
nothing but that's pretty much going to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.340 
nothing but that's pretty much going to
