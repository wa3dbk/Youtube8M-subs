for<00:01:18.470> some<00:01:18.590> reason<00:01:19.270> maybe<00:01:20.270> this<00:01:20.479> one<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.750> mix<00:01:20.930> it

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
for some reason maybe this one to mix it

he intimidates to
it's<00:01:29.760> always<00:01:29.909> interesting<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.510> have<00:01:31.130> come<00:01:32.130> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.090 
it's always interesting I have come on
staring<00:01:32.940> contests<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.010> really<00:01:35.010> should

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
staring contests like this really should

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:45.570

use<00:01:35.310> rock<00:01:35.520> slide<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.510> taken<00:01:36.869> less<00:01:37.020> time

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.660 

but<00:01:46.180> yeah<00:01:46.510> this<00:01:46.720> would<00:01:46.870> be<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.080> fourth<00:01:47.260> value

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

pokemon tower the initial value add with

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
pokemon tower the initial value add with
a<00:01:55.450> vague<00:01:55.600> way<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:55.990> then<00:01:56.790> next<00:01:57.790> up<00:01:57.940> will<00:01:58.150> be<00:01:58.180> I
