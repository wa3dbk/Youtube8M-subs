hello<00:00:00.480> intero<00:00:00.840> chemistry<00:00:01.850> is<00:00:02.850> based<00:00:03.300> upon

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
hello intero chemistry is based upon

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.680 
hello intero chemistry is based upon
unidirectional<00:00:05.069> flow<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.549> information<00:00:05.850> and

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
unidirectional flow of information and

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.890 
unidirectional flow of information and
it<00:00:07.259> does<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.529> by<00:00:08.000> having<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.300> chemical

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
it does that by having a chemical

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980 
it does that by having a chemical
synapse<00:00:10.490> where<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.849> neuron<00:00:12.240> releases<00:00:12.599> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
synapse where one neuron releases a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.740 
synapse where one neuron releases a
chemical<00:00:13.190> into<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.460> substrate<00:00:15.030> which

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
chemical into the substrate which

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.380 
chemical into the substrate which
affects<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.529> other<00:00:16.560> neurons<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.850> cause<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
affects the other neurons to cause a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.779 
affects the other neurons to cause a
transmission<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.289> information<00:00:19.640> we're<00:00:20.640> going

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
transmission of information we're going

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.359 
transmission of information we're going
to<00:00:20.850> talk<00:00:21.060> about<00:00:21.619> chemical<00:00:22.619> transmission

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
to talk about chemical transmission

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.109 
to talk about chemical transmission
today<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.600> relationship<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.500> her<00:00:25.529> own<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> one

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
today and relationship in her own so one

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:52.340 
today and relationship in her own so one
of<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> questions<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:50.120> about<00:00:51.120> Declan<00:00:51.809> plasmic

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of the questions we about Declan plasmic

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.889 
of the questions we about Declan plasmic
transport<00:00:52.949> system<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.660> can

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
transport system so that you can

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.660 
transport system so that you can
essentially<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:56.930> your<00:00:57.930> vesicle<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.309> allow

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
essentially take your vesicle that allow

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.240 
essentially take your vesicle that allow
it<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> ratchet<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.100> neurofilaments

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
it to ratchet down the neurofilaments

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.429 
it to ratchet down the neurofilaments
and<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and that way I can get down to the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
and that way I can get down to the
synaptic<00:01:08.070> terminal<00:01:08.549> without<00:01:08.670> creating<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
synaptic terminal without creating a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:31.850 
synaptic terminal without creating a
problem<00:01:09.840> oh<00:01:12.470> my<00:01:13.470> god

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.249 

okay<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.369> if<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.390> receptor<00:01:35.080> here

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
okay so if this is the receptor here

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.380 
okay so if this is the receptor here
comes<00:01:35.530> out<00:01:35.770> still<00:01:36.070> going<00:01:37.380> point<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.820> causes

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
comes out still going point that causes

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.389 
comes out still going point that causes
response<00:01:40.869> which<00:01:41.200> activates<00:01:41.770> are<00:01:41.979> still<00:01:42.190> going

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
response which activates are still going

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:53.820 
response which activates are still going
up<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.479> now<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.750> researcher<00:01:53.259> is<00:01:53.440> running

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
up and now the researcher is running

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.539 
up and now the researcher is running
again<00:01:54.159> okay<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:58.270> have<00:01:58.479> much<00:01:58.720> better<00:01:59.549> podiums

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
again okay just have much better podiums

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.690 
again okay just have much better podiums
and<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:02.350> can<00:02:02.530> tell<00:02:02.740> how<00:02:02.920> many<00:02:03.009> lectures<00:02:03.340> I've

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
and you can tell how many lectures I've

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.430 
and you can tell how many lectures I've
given<00:02:04.060> by<00:02:04.210> how<00:02:04.390> many<00:02:04.450> debts<00:02:04.869> there<00:02:05.170> were<00:02:07.440> this

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
given by how many debts there were this

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.460 
given by how many debts there were this
was<00:02:08.649> nice<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.280> like<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:10.290> good<00:02:11.290> ring<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.830> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
was nice I like this a good ring to it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.610 
was nice I like this a good ring to it
so<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:15.489> you
