00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 I'm one of tablet ii and this one 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.240
 is a quick comparison between the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.230
 coach and the planner in elegy pro 2 and 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.880
 5 times say we first go around 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.790
 continue to turn around and look at us 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.740
 what they offer so on the one hand in front 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.100
 of course, immediately falls to the big one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 display of lg pro 2 it is extra large 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.230
 but offers the same before the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.760
 Resolution like the lg youtube is one 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.410
 really very bright display of the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.480
 brightness are both but mine 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 opinion after identical so well in the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.759
 sun readable 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.070
 The frames are a bit thicker here 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.620
 but that bothers at all are still 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.450
 super thin on his side are readable 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 they both really wonderful 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 striker regains his strengths 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.890
 really look at the displays because of it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.809
 very great displays very sharp 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 the tour is still a tick sharper 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.440
 but in my opinion it will too 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.510
 no longer at this very high level 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.449
 resolution 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.469
 otherwise front cameras are both 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.570
 2 megapixels below no buttons on the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.140
 bottom here the speaker at t2 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.180
 at the g pro 2 this is on the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 back a micro-usb connection to 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.970
 lan phy around three and a half millimeters 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.610
 headphones output 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.130
 he is at gp2 otherwise 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.110
 right and left no connections no 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.010
 because they are on again 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.590
 the back 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.450
 These are really reactive 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 but here we have one 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 integrated an idea like the lg flex 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.930
 for example, I also think so 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.590
 useful here it is only the ring of 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.180
 then you 'll see right now 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.870
 exactly 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.230
 so otherwise both have one up 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.280
 microphone but also an infrared port 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.420
 that means I know there will be on the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.370
 TVs really serve a lot 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.040
 practically 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.170
 the camera is 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.010
 identical to the megapixel number 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:58.000
 but the gp2 can be a bit more 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.850
 by having full hd videos 60 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.490
 can record frames but also 27 p 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 videos 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.560
 with 120 frames per second that's her name 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.160
 can nice slow motion videos 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.110
 create 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.000
 and besides, it can also 4k videos 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.450
 So record if your new tv 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.370
 with 4k then that is likely 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.239
 the device would have to be from the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.750
 back side 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.959
 the tattoo is gleaming so beautiful has one 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.640
 shiny plastic lid the g pro 2 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.500
 It's a bit macho a bit 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.930
 Silky feels in my opinion 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.880
 a little higher quality goods were in total 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.480
 one can well process the pharmacies 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.670
 lose weight 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.990
 You can also replace the battery 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.880
 Nevertheless , it really felt very much 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.350
 solid and have well built 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.740
 ultimately a matter of taste what you 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.740
 Mr. likes 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.010
 yes otherwise the gp2 have me behind 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.780
 an internal one because that is the one here 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.680
 Korean version and can handle it 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.450
 watching TV 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.640
 with in germany if it is then 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.130
 So it's not available on the market 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.020
 then you have no answer what 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.890
 Also new is a few software 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.190
 features and one 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 we had this coupon here at the g2 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.379
 from the kof 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.940
 that means with a double in 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.160
 the middle of the display the device and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.510
 make out here it is different came here 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.210
 So good at recognizing a specific one 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.730
 Morse-like code, so to speak 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.080
 and the device to unlock I think 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.880
 very handy a cool one 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.680
 further development will also be coming soon 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.230
 for the youtube com 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.870
 but first, of course, she's ahead here 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.220
 otherwise they are 62 in size 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.540
 Of course a lot and are not so 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.850
 great with a to use 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.050
 that's why you can here the display so 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.150
 make it smaller and a little bit smaller 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.210
 Okay I say my right-hander so 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.860
 typical him a sms with the little one 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.680
 display can be a bit more 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.660
 enlarge 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.610
 june where, so to speak, you can see it all 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.130
 I'm pretty handy for that 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.500
 also does not need it but at the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.930
 not synonymous size 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.960
 otherwise from the data of nearly 800 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.580
 Both processors have two gigabytes 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.550
 Memory also have both 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.860
 they are fast 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.560
 rather good the battery is here again 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.710
 a bit of jazz but the displays are on 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.330
 3000 milliamps are 2200 das 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.900
 Of course, display is a bit more 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.900
 electricity 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.130
 so I would not be there now 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.390
 that in the battery life is 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.700
 probably about two 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.430
 thick that the pro tour is one 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.300
 a bit thicker but not much 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.880
 if you like us that way 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.390
 one sees one another so much more 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.370
 it not 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.550
 feels really good down a lot 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.020
 I like it at first sound a 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.690
 really good at first impression 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.690
 otherwise it was the comparison 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.640
 between the lg tour and the lg pro 2 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.290
 if the video has driven you give 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.490
 A thumbs up to me and subscribed to in 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.130
 nicer sub below in the comments 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.910
 which one you like better of the lg pro2 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.810
 of the 9th 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.700
 or that lg do that a little bit smaller though 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.960
 compact smartphone so we read each other 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.430
 in the comments I am a few 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.710
 contacts that I here with the comparison 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.180
 between the lg type and the lg per time 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.720
 at the mobile world congress in 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.800
 Barcelona 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.800
 Thanks for seeing
