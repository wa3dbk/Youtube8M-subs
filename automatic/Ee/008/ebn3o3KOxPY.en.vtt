00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.890

 will be very popular kinda this 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.230

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.260
 the like 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.309
 this mode is called tnt wound ride and 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.250
 games 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.440
 there is not much difference and so to play 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.190
 we in this mode, we first need 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.190
 minecraft license 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.489
 if you do not have and I do not despair 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.540

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.030
 take part and you will get lucky 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.090
 so here we have minecraft licenses 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.570
 we go we add to ourselves the mc server 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.990
 high pixel no name will be in 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.340
 the description is more accurate these servers so here 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.320
 this is the server you have added 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.840

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.600
 We go to this server not only TNT wound 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.330
 and various other modes are we like 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.240
 so we appear here in such a crowd 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.270
 just here they are trampling us very much 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 feet sound a bit annoying 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.970
 of course so in the hands we see us 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.390
 bone of course why she needs a book 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.560

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.350
