00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
texture through here and it has some

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
texture through here and it has some
grips<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> side<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> hold

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

thing so you can put the screen down

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.029 
thing so you can put the screen down
face-first<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.140> worry<00:00:46.350> about<00:00:46.410> cracks

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
face-first and not worry about cracks

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.010 
face-first and not worry about cracks

and ships and things on the side of your

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.690 
and ships and things on the side of your
screen<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.500> works<00:00:50.039> great<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> screen

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
don't have to worry too much gives you a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.570 
don't have to worry too much gives you a
bout<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.080> too<00:01:25.350> much<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> lip<00:01:25.950> but

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
bout you know not too much of a lip but

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.880 
bout you know not too much of a lip but
enough<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.290> protect<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:30.030> device

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
enough to really just protect the device

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.350 
enough to really just protect the device
let<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.040> try<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.700> focus<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
let me try to get this and focus for you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.770 
let me try to get this and focus for you
so<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:33.840> idea<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.650> go

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.310 

so<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.729> simple<00:01:41.150> case<00:01:41.330> just<00:01:41.810> protects<00:01:42.140> it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
so really simple case just protects it

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.289 
so really simple case just protects it
