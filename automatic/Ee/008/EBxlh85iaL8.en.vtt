00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.769
 Aldo was Alberta. 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.490
 Japan satellite reception chip is reduced 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.289
 It's a famous gps chip. 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.289
 Worst 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.909
 When you take a position to prepare for withdrawal 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.130
 Just as it is clear where your current location is. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.660
 In order to be better, 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.319
 I can tell, I have experience, 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:40.200
 You can have your current location. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.630
 that is 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.480
 Maybe it's when you have some of the applied arts 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.110
 I do not know where he was, 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 There's someone like that. 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.890
 It seems like a credit crunch 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.760
 When you run, walk or ride a bicycle 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.910
 How much rights do you have 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.910
 At what speed I am doing the course 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.120
 Showing on screen 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.230
 Such a disgrace. 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.520
 So this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.290
 update3 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 This is the vice-president's office. 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.870
 I think I paid the prepayment. 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.410
 If you run it tomorrow 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 I see myself running. 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.420
 If you look at the editorials, 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060
 Do you believe that discipline is talking about other things or values? 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.140
 Cycling awareness 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.380
 in power 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.710
 I'm walking around. 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.050
 You may be able to persuade this information. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580
 Because I'm going to walk 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.140
 Because I usually walk a lot, I set the mode to working 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.270
 And 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.110
 If you look at this screen 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.869
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs will show speed. Couple 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 I can go a kilometer. 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.240
 How much time has passed since you started. 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 How much time has passed is Takahashi. 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.409
 Now, 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.189
 Do you go past the fire gauge meter? 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.249
 So let's speed this part up 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.989
 I only have 1.5 meters to get rid of. 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.779
 It was up. 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.779
 If you walk quickly, you'll drink these 10. 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.339
 A few minutes to a kilometer 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.749
 There is also concern. 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.029
 Something. 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.029
 Press left and restart yogurt 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.399
 The honorary lecture begins. 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:41.700
 in reality 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.729
 I'm going to look at the worrisome process. 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.419
 How big the distance was 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.179
 The speed I walk is the point 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.859
 Would 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.109
 I'll see you from now on. 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.169
 start button 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.169
 wr 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.499
 Open diversity 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.729
 Science topic 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.349
 Seoul Yonhap News 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.229
 lately 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.229
 14px 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 Popular group withdrawal from Japan 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.329
 tn 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.329
 It broke. 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.849
 Unprecedented speed 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.149
 But how much do we 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:00.859
 I can know the amount. 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:01.909
 I would like more
