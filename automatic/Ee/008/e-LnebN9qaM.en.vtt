 important in Latin America is called 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.680
 brute force and it's a multisensory show 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.460
 in which actors and spectators are the 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.440
 protagonists 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.650
 a TV team traveled to Argentina 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.609
 and talked with its creators the note is 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.609
 de france- red 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.550
 in this show every moment astonishes the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 viewer 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.610
 in an instant someone flies 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.610
 against a wall or defies gravity 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.350
 in another a group is launched and dances in a 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.350
 swimming pool on the heights 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.239
 here there are no chairs or seats the public 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.250
 is part and also participant of each 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 scene in a story that suits 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.260
 what everyone wants to imagine 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.590
 we try to achieve as that feeling of 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.330
 that you are inside a place where 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.360
 things happen everything that happens is 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.280
 real and one can participate or not but 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.050
 you are there and you are part of it 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.050
 you could modify what is happening 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.620
 the show people can move and also 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.980
 in the meantime you can dance to the beat 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.980
 Music 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.189
 for being gross is clearly a show 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.869
 delirious a kind of theater in 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.450
 third dimension where you can live 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.520
 intense sensory experiences from 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.640
 feel the rain the wind up 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.260
 be scared with a shot 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.990
 in the end I control something that being 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.990
 huge in a life experience 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.869
 since its creation in Argentina in 2003 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.849
 they wanted to get away from what was the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.319
 traditional theater and convert each 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.689
 of his six scenes in an experiment 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.409
 with such success that the show has traveled 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.409
 the world 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.670
 There are 10 dancers that require 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.650
 hours of rehearsal and so be able to do in 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.720
 perfect precision from thick 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.430
 extreme to the soft delicacy 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.430
 poetic dance on the water 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.560
 and more than anything like having the body 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.780
 available to whatever comes or what is 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.019
 whatever comes what happens to us 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.400
 come on the idea is not to stop all 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.829
 we have some kind of history of 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.590
 bodywork let's say or are 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.900
 dancers or acrobats or actors of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.849
 physical theater and we already have a career 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 in preparing for this kind of 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.900
 impacts are those actors together with a 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.700
 great technical team those who will land 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.889

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.989
 in the case of chile we have to mount 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.170
 a stage work height prepare 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.150
 The theme of water caring for the public is a 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.400
 effort that takes several months of 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.040
 previous work functions that may be 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.200
