00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello everyone and welcome back a new video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.930
 tutorial on photoshop 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.870
 today I will explain to you how to go to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.719
 remove the haze in our photos 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.759
 as you can see this haze appears in the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 photo especially when we use gods 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 zoom lens themes between planes 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.289
 focal and the other as you see it in fact 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 part in front of my photo is perfect 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.180
 while the one behind appears as opaque 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.099
 as if there had been a haze 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.349
 this is because the camera 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.690
 fails to capture all this 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 range that sees our eye then 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 we must send it to remove in post 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 production is to say that in some 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.420
 foto the mist creates atmospheres then 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 it should not be removed but I inspired it 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.350
 same as going to remove the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.879
 easily then first of all 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 haze is simply removed 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.690
 adding contrast in our photo 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.820
 you see serious increase the contrast comes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.539
 removed much of the haze and colors 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 they come back out but it's just enough 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.379
 go and duplicate this level on 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.239
 our background with against the je go to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.510
 change the blending mode from normal 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 to multiply you already see how the colors 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 are a little raised on the added 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
 contrast obviously multiplies goes to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.240
 darken our photo totally or 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.460
 we can use soft light or 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 overlap to achieve more contrast 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.610
 in this case I will use superimpose 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.520
 because it seems to me what fits 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.860
 more to this type of photo and I go to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.869
 mask this part below the photo 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 I add a layer mask and seen 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.700
 that the white mask I take the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.490
 black brush and I go to color on 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.490
 my front part of the photo 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:54.330
 ok i did a little to hell but you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.580
 you can do it much more precisely and 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.830
 I would say we got rid of it 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.970
 mainly of the true haze 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.060
 we can go add a level 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.009
 vividness to make people stand out 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.470
 even more colors and maybe go to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.780
 give a touch of contrast even more 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.150
 using a tonal value level 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.880
 ok date as with three simple steps 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.340
 we went from a photo with the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.950
 haze and with very dead colors a 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.260
 a picture like that as mentioned above 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.520
 this effect on some photos makes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.070
 particularly therefore it is not necessary 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.600
 going to remove photo change vi 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.700
 I show another example 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.980
 these are me looking at the golden gate 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.170
 as you see I and the stones we have 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.330
 excellent colors but the background does 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.860
 really it sucks everything is right 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.690
 all full of hazy and so I go to 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.160
 duplicate the background layer I go to 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.160
 change the blend method to 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.170
 multiplies to see what it is like 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.890
 then I look a bit like light comes on 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.489
 suffused and overlapped that I would say that 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.080
 here too you can use overlay 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.350
 despite giving me some color cast 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.660
 blue that we will fix after then 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.360
 since this photo has a horizon 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.519
 more or less straight goes to add one 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.799
 mask of the level and I take it 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.830
 gradient tool I go from top to top 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.110
 the low since I did n't make a mistake but 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.750
 from the bottom upwards since or the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.989
 black as an exact primary color and I go 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.549
 to create a gradient from below to 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.019
 above the photo 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.739
 who does not know how to use level masks 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.570
 with the relative gradient era is prayed 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.519
 to watch my tutorial on 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.380
 level 1 masks to learn 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.510
 a little something new 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.730
 ok i'd say we're the only thing 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.860
 what I want to do is take a 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.360
 brush and color black as the 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.250
 white mask over my face 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:56.820
 since it is now too dark 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:58.770
 also above a before and an after of mine 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.140
 photo is already much improved but though 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.390
 so I don't like these blue lines 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.340
 I'm going to use a curve level I go 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.020
 to copy the layer mask below 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.150
 holding it high, drag it 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.050
 above so as to apply this 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.360
 curved effect only to the sky 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.430
 slider change from rgb and blue and port gi 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.420
 the blue bar to go to 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.970
 get rid of the blue in the background that 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.860
 gives us a little and then I go to the green for 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.970
 make it stand out a little and increase 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.100
 slightly green ok and I also go into the 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.510
 red and slightly add a little 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.740
 red ok I just have to add a 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.520
 bit of mistrust because you know it 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.080
 I always add one to blurt nice 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.880
 you want to see that you don't do it and go to 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.820
 add a level tonal values ​​for 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.060
 go to give further contrast 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.980
 to my photo 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.260
 ok maybe it lowers some capacity of 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.419
 these levels and we have gone from one 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.640
 such pictures to this result 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.860
 final as you see the result is a lot 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.870
 different obviously the background you can 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.729
 you can play it the way you want you can go 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:11.100
 increase the colors but the photo and cake 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:14.880
 are is cake is a little straighten it looked 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.290
 in peace door then I thank you for 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.729
 having also seen this tutorial mi 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.380
 I recommend you remember that if you want 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.810
 remove the haze just go to 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.690
 duplicate the background layer and change 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.740
 the blending mode from normal ao 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.390
 multiply or overlap or soft light e 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.770
 look at what's coming back to you 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.419
 best for your photo 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.370
 I thank you for seeing this 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.860
 video make yourself like below if there is 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.050
