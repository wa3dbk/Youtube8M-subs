00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
basically you go around beating the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.810 
basically you go around beating the
out<00:04:21.560> of<00:04:21.739> stuff<00:04:22.010> there<00:04:22.280> are<00:04:22.370> plenty<00:04:22.610> of

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
out of stuff there are plenty of

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.150 
out of stuff there are plenty of
environments<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.720> choose<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.169> right<00:04:24.979> I'm

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
environments to choose on right I'm

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.150 
environments to choose on right I'm
showing<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.580> how<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:26.860> basically<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.950> just

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
showing you how to basically you just

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.980 
showing you how to basically you just
pick<00:04:28.400> up<00:04:28.430> spells<00:04:28.880> on<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.150> ground<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:29.660> will

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
pick up spells on the ground you will

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.100 
pick up spells on the ground you will
buy<00:04:30.260> them<00:04:30.500> from<00:04:30.680> shops<00:04:31.810> slow<00:04:32.810> isn't<00:04:32.990> a

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
buy them from shops slow isn't a

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.570 
buy them from shops slow isn't a
particularly<00:04:33.410> useful<00:04:33.650> one<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.130> got<00:04:34.340> rid<00:04:34.550> of

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
particularly useful one so I got rid of

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.560 
particularly useful one so I got rid of
it

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
it

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.659 
it
I<00:04:35.600> probably<00:04:36.350> did<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:36.860> by<00:04:37.039> accident<00:04:37.580> that

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
I probably did that by accident that

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.360 
I probably did that by accident that
nevermind<00:04:39.940> of<00:04:40.940> course<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:42.110> isn't<00:04:42.590> complete

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
nevermind of course this isn't complete

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.850 
nevermind of course this isn't complete
manga<00:04:43.850> style<00:04:44.450> missions<00:04:45.020> I'm<00:04:45.289> doing<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.740> mission

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
manga style missions I'm doing a mission

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.730 
manga style missions I'm doing a mission
right<00:04:46.160> now<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.340> have<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.669> protect<00:04:46.850> that<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.740> don't

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
right now I have to protect that I don't

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.000 
right now I have to protect that I don't
come<00:04:48.979> being<00:04:49.190> killed<00:04:49.490> by<00:04:49.760> monsters<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:51.800> is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
come being killed by monsters this is

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.560 
come being killed by monsters this is
that<00:04:52.160> tune<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.520> newer<00:04:52.760> missions<00:04:53.180> added<00:04:53.479> to

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
that tune the newer missions added to

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.560 
that tune the newer missions added to
the<00:04:53.660> fake<00:04:53.900> staple<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.100> speak<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.729> it

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
the fake staple so to speak and it

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.540 
the fake staple so to speak and it
really<00:04:56.780> shows<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.620> actual<00:04:57.979> developers

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
really shows that the actual developers

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.340 
really shows that the actual developers
were<00:04:58.760> not<00:04:59.090> thinking<00:04:59.539> about<00:04:59.660> how<00:04:59.990> they<00:05:00.169> could

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
were not thinking about how they could

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.820 
were not thinking about how they could
actually<00:05:00.530> push<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.130> serious<00:05:01.520> world<00:05:02.830> these

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
actually push the serious world these

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.800 
actually push the serious world these
missions<00:05:04.310> have<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:04.820> be<00:05:04.910> quite<00:05:05.150> hard<00:05:05.360> if<00:05:05.630> you're

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
missions have to be quite hard if you're

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.480 
missions have to be quite hard if you're
low<00:05:05.990> level<00:05:06.440> because<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:06.979> don't<00:05:07.160> really<00:05:07.370> have

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
low level because you don't really have

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.070 
low level because you don't really have
the<00:05:07.840> damage<00:05:08.840> per<00:05:09.289> second<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.400> speak<00:05:10.760> for<00:05:11.240> to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
the damage per second so to speak for to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.040 
the damage per second so to speak for to
stop<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.500> onslaught<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:12.979> monsters<00:05:13.820> but<00:05:14.150> you

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
stop the onslaught of monsters but you

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.159 
stop the onslaught of monsters but you
can<00:05:15.169> keep<00:05:15.349> behind

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
can keep behind

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.409 
can keep behind
just<00:05:16.349> a<00:05:16.499> few<00:05:16.620> matter<00:05:16.979> too<00:05:17.219> much<00:05:17.249> if<00:05:17.639> you<00:05:17.819> fail

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
just a few matter too much if you fail

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.179 
just a few matter too much if you fail
first<00:05:18.930> time<00:05:19.169> around<00:05:19.319> it's<00:05:19.710> also<00:05:19.860> quite<00:05:20.159> good

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
first time around it's also quite good

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.040 
first time around it's also quite good
for<00:05:20.550> getting<00:05:20.669> any<00:05:20.879> experience<00:05:21.389> opposed<00:05:21.689> even

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
for getting any experience opposed even

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.659 
for getting any experience opposed even
though<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.259> monsters<00:05:22.650> don't<00:05:22.889> drop<00:05:23.129> any<00:05:23.340> loop

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
though the monsters don't drop any loop

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.290 
though the monsters don't drop any loop
you<00:05:24.659> still<00:05:24.930> get<00:05:25.050> exp<00:05:25.379> for<00:05:25.650> killing<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:27.060> it's

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
you still get exp for killing so it's

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.439 
you still get exp for killing so it's
not<00:05:27.449> all<00:05:27.719> that<00:05:27.749> bad<00:05:28.819> right<00:05:29.819> what<00:05:30.060> I'm<00:05:30.180> showing

people like to compete against each

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.110 
people like to compete against each
other<00:06:27.779> so<00:06:27.960> they<00:06:28.169> made<00:06:28.409> hardcore<00:06:29.069> mode<00:06:29.339> which

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
other so they made hardcore mode which

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.409 
other so they made hardcore mode which
is<00:06:30.270> lifted<00:06:30.629> directly<00:06:30.750> from<00:06:31.050> Diablo<00:06:31.770> 2

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
is lifted directly from Diablo 2

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.339 
is lifted directly from Diablo 2
essentially<00:06:33.419> this<00:06:33.509> means<00:06:33.719> you<00:06:33.930> character

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
essentially this means you character

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.469 
essentially this means you character
can't<00:06:34.620> down<00:06:34.979> he<00:06:35.310> does<00:06:35.580> two<00:06:35.789> more<00:06:35.939> that's<00:06:36.210> it

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
can't down he does two more that's it

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.639 
can't down he does two more that's it
they're<00:06:36.779> dead<00:06:37.020> forever<00:06:38.180> and<00:06:39.289> you<00:06:40.289> should<00:06:40.529> get

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:40.649 
they're dead forever and you should get

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:44.809 
they're dead forever and you should get
graded<00:06:40.979> on<00:06:41.219> score<00:06:41.759> by<00:06:42.539> items<00:06:43.379> and<00:06:43.979> experience

and<00:06:45.029> monsters<00:06:45.449> killed<00:06:45.719> I<00:06:45.930> believe<00:06:47.180> this<00:06:48.180> gives

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
and monsters killed I believe this gives

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.600 
and monsters killed I believe this gives
