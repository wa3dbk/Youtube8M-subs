00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.680
 The main purpose of this lesson here is 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.029
 We 're trying to call the flop with 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.490
 the post flop 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.289
 that is, we have already learned from the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.779
 ourselves learned to listen 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.250
 kings who learned to make the Tribeca 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 which one did I mess up 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.759
 so we basically learned to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.770
 do the basics of everything on the preflop but 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
 in the past three rooms he is speaking 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.260
 A lot about flop posts mainly 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.120
 on the flop sometimes it's about the team 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.270
 but until today made no connection 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.160
 between the flop and opash flop 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.870
 so the idea of this class that people 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.379
 try to learn a little how it is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.480
 preflop influences post-flop 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.550
 The second factor is easy also is the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 number of players who have been proposed 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.300
 flop 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 that is to say we divide ourselves into two 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.510
 categories that are the most is the pot 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.760
 heads up or were only two 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.299
 persons with their own proposals only two 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.909
 that the pot that is going to be most played is not 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.729
 the challenge is the most important the second 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.790
 package type is a multiway pot or 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.369
 is there more than three opponents is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.329
 more than three players in the pot in the post 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.070
 flop 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.780
 here I'll get some definitions is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.729
 For now it will not make much sense 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 Here is what I'm talking about here. 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.350
 about spr 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:49.380
 but next there will ever explain what 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:55.649
 the sp and the group with the rest of the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:59.850
 Class is no question here if you play much more 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.060
 aggressive that the last law more or less 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.399
 that's right 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 jg rf depends a little on the year 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.410
 situation but since it will characterize 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.410
 How does each type depot beauty play 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.470
 Okay, the Afghan said we'll create more. 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.660
 one definition is I'll present more 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.660
 a tool for you 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:29.360
 I believe that most do not know Mr. 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.240
 I would say well in a very lay manner 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.080
 is more or less a tool like 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.620
 pots 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.060
 only it has another utility and we will 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.160
 get back to you how we're going to use it 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.820
 she first of all spr or spectrum 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.740
 pot is simply the division between 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.820
 the active technicians can nothing that mr 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.950
 no matter what it is and what it does 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.950
 now mr 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.050
 is the effective coach divided by the pot 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.760
 remembering that it is effective in class three 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.860
 I think I said that it is 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.490
 competitive is the smallest stec 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.520
 between the players that are in the hand 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.150
 because the lesser that you do, right? 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.800
 if the guy has 100 other has 30 only goes 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.830
 being in pot 30 does not matter every 100 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.690
 thousand 2 thousand 4 thousand only has 30 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.690
 then a call from the effective technician
