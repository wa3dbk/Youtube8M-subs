00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
made all the way across the shirt face

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.600 
made all the way across the shirt face
that<00:00:31.239> line<00:00:31.449> as<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.720> baseline<00:00:32.470> for<00:00:33.010> my<00:00:33.160> scallop

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
that line as a baseline for my scallop

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.770 
that line as a baseline for my scallop
and<00:00:33.910> I<00:00:34.480> used<00:00:34.719> eight<00:00:35.250> cuts<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.760> trace<00:00:37.149> with

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
and I used eight cuts to trace with

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.110 
and I used eight cuts to trace with
chalk<00:00:38.289> again<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:39.219> it<00:00:39.520> kind<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.789> looks<00:00:40.030> like

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
chalk again and it kind of looks like

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.240 
chalk again and it kind of looks like
little<00:00:40.480> waves<00:00:40.690> when<00:00:41.019> you<00:00:41.140> trace<00:00:41.379> it<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:42.190> you

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
little waves when you trace it so you

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.970 
little waves when you trace it so you
just<00:00:42.430> trace<00:00:42.789> it<00:00:42.820> all<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.780> way<00:00:43.960> along<00:00:44.620> the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
just trace it all the way along the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.310 
just trace it all the way along the
front<00:00:45.219> of<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.430> shirt<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:46.629> then<00:00:46.899> you<00:00:47.079> cut

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
front of the shirt and then you cut

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.020 
front of the shirt and then you cut
through<00:00:47.500> both<00:00:47.769> layers<00:00:47.949> of<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.579> shirt<00:00:48.789> at<00:00:49.000> the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
through both layers of the shirt at the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.650 
through both layers of the shirt at the
same<00:00:49.449> time<00:00:49.780> using<00:00:50.559> some<00:00:51.390> pretty<00:00:52.390> sharp

scissors<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:54.429> don't<00:00:54.910> have<00:00:55.120> sharp

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.319 
to trace a huge circle and then
something<00:01:09.280> smaller<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.759> trace<00:01:10.000> little

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
something smaller to trace little

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.240 
something smaller to trace little

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
circles and I just hand drew the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.499 
circles and I just hand drew the
squiggle<00:01:12.729> in<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.939> middle<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.329> make<00:01:13.450> a

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
squiggle in the middle to make a

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.899 
squiggle in the middle to make a
yin-yang<00:01:14.020> symbol<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:15.130> used<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.369> bleach<00:01:15.579> pen

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909

and<00:01:16.329> a<00:01:16.509> sponge<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.259> even<00:01:17.649> out<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.829> bleach<00:01:18.130> pen

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
and a sponge to even out the bleach pen

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.080 
and a sponge to even out the bleach pen
and<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:20.020> pretty<00:01:20.350> much<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.829> so<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.939> need

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and that was pretty much it so you need

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:42.260 
and that was pretty much it so you need
to<00:01:22.240> wash<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.930> then<00:01:23.320> it's<00:01:23.680> ready<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.250> wear

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.600 

if<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.390> chain<00:01:43.720> doesn't<00:01:44.170> look<00:01:44.439> perfect<00:01:44.979> but<00:01:45.280> I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
if a chain doesn't look perfect but I

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.999 
if a chain doesn't look perfect but I
like<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.329> rugged<00:01:46.659> look<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.560> think<00:01:47.590> it's

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
like the rugged look and I think it's

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.969 
like the rugged look and I think it's
fun<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.600> really<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:52.990> great<00:01:53.289> piece<00:01:53.560> for<00:01:53.890> the
