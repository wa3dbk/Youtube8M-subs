00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
example let's all recognize that he

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.450 
example let's all recognize that he
bypassed<00:02:21.600> my<00:02:21.810> main<00:02:22.110> point<00:02:22.440> which<00:02:22.860> was<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.280> he

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
bypassed my main point which was that he

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.820 
bypassed my main point which was that he
took<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.940> range<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.630> Van<00:02:24.840> Alen<00:02:25.230> proposed<00:02:25.620> as

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
took the range that Van Alen proposed as

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.310 
took the range that Van Alen proposed as
a<00:02:25.860> maximum<00:02:26.370> radiation<00:02:27.060> level<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.480> stated<00:02:28.200> as

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
a maximum radiation level and stated as

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.040 
a maximum radiation level and stated as
a<00:02:28.350> fact<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.160> maximum<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.090> maximum

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
a fact that the maximum of that maximum

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.140 
a fact that the maximum of that maximum
is<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.650> happened<00:02:32.040> completely<00:02:32.550> ignoring<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
is what happened completely ignoring the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.210 
is what happened completely ignoring the
fact<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.990> exposure<00:02:34.410> was<00:02:34.710> more<00:02:34.980> likely

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
fact that the exposure was more likely

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.650 
fact that the exposure was more likely
somewhere<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.060> here

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
somewhere in here

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140 
somewhere in here
then<00:02:37.320> he<00:02:37.410> adds<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.830> his<00:02:37.980> false<00:02:38.280> assumptions<00:02:38.850> by

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
then he adds to his false assumptions by

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.199 
then he adds to his false assumptions by
saying<00:02:39.770> secondly<00:02:40.770> considering<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.820> all<00:02:42.030> the

saying secondly considering that all the

saying secondly considering that all the
Apollo<00:02:42.510> astronauts<00:02:43.050> returned<00:02:43.740> with
