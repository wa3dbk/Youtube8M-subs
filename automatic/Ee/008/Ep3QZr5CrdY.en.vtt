00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969 
it I'll just in a second so you can get
this<00:01:02.879> pretty<00:01:03.149> much<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> organic<00:01:04.439> shops<00:01:04.680> or

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
this pretty much at the organic shops or

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.520 
this pretty much at the organic shops or
different<00:01:05.339> whole<00:01:05.460> food<00:01:05.610> stores<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.470> they<00:01:07.470> are

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
different whole food stores and they are

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
different whole food stores and they are
pretty<00:01:07.770> inexpensive<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.659> would<00:01:09.869> suggest

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
pretty inexpensive so I would suggest

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.000 
pretty inexpensive so I would suggest
doing<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.640> taking<00:01:12.270> aloe<00:01:12.630> vera<00:01:13.010> everyday

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
doing this and taking aloe vera everyday

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
doing this and taking aloe vera everyday
if<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.280> could<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.880> least<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.150> few<00:01:15.299> times<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
if you could but at least a few times a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.100 
if you could but at least a few times a
week

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
week

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.340 
week
so<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:16.619> let's<00:01:16.890> learn<00:01:17.040> how<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> filet

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.570 

and<00:01:20.530> what<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.310> usually<00:01:21.520> do<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.770> cup<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:24.040> cut<00:01:24.460> the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
and what I usually do is I cup I cut the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.210 
and what I usually do is I cup I cut the
top<00:01:24.880> off<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.720> it's<00:01:26.049> easier<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.590> work<00:01:26.740> with<00:01:26.799> the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
top off so it's easier to work with the

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.820 
top off so it's easier to work with the
flat<00:01:27.460> surface<00:01:27.880> here<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:29.080> here<00:01:29.380> I'll<00:01:29.560> cut

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
flat surface here and so here I'll cut

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.480 
flat surface here and so here I'll cut
this<00:01:29.950> off<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.640> I'll<00:01:30.970> set<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.240> aside<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:32.490> these

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
this off and I'll set it aside and these

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.190 
this off and I'll set it aside and these
two<00:01:33.700> parts<00:01:34.060> are<00:01:34.149> a<00:01:34.210> little<00:01:34.390> different<00:01:34.750> because

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
two parts are a little different because

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.260 
two parts are a little different because
this<00:01:35.649> part<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.100> little<00:01:36.220> bit<00:01:36.490> more<00:01:36.610> skinny<00:01:37.000> as

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
this part is a little bit more skinny as

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.620 
this part is a little bit more skinny as
you<00:01:37.479> can<00:01:37.690> see<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.140> inside<00:01:38.530> part<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:40.360> bid

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
you can see the inside part and this bid

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.990 
you can see the inside part and this bid
is<00:01:40.899> more<00:01:41.409> chunky<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.729> part<00:01:42.940> that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
is more chunky so this is the part that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.850 
is more chunky so this is the part that
I<00:01:43.149> use<00:01:43.330> for<00:01:43.479> juicing<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.619> part

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
I use for juicing and this is the part

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.310 
I use for juicing and this is the part
that<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.070> tried<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.369> flatten<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:46.180> bit<00:01:46.659> by<00:01:46.780> bit<00:01:46.810> and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
that I tried to flatten a bit by bit and

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.620 
that I tried to flatten a bit by bit and
use<00:01:47.440> for<00:01:47.680> my<00:01:47.770> skincare<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.940> as<00:01:49.270> well<00:01:49.509> as<00:01:49.539> the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
use for my skincare so as well as the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.389 
use for my skincare so as well as the
bottom<00:01:50.020> part<00:01:50.259> here<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.619> go<00:01:50.830> we'll<00:01:51.159> cut<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
bottom part here we go we'll cut the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.960 
bottom part here we go we'll cut the
bottom<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.590> now<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:54.009> is<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.280> uneven<00:01:54.729> part

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
bottom so now this is the uneven part

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.690
